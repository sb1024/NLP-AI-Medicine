"Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Drug development and approval is a costly process with nearly $2 billion spent for each drug that is approved. One of the most significant contributors to this high cost is the expense of developing drugs that fail to pass clinical trials – only 15% of drugs that begin clinical trials are approved for use on humans. A common reason for not reaching the FDA’s criteria for approval is that the drug is classified as cardiotoxic, which cannot be detected during early stages of drug development. One way that drugs can lead to cardiotoxicity is by altering the electrical activity of ion channels that are responsible for the excitation of the heart tissue that pumps blood to the body. Understanding which ion channels, and the extent to which these ion channels are affected is central to determining the cardiotoxicity of a drug. Early-stage predictions of cardiotoxicity are based on animal studies that are poor models of human heart behavior or single-cell electrophysiological studies that falsely assume underlying pathophysiology based on action potential changes. The recent development of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offers an opportunity to study drug effects on human cells in a preclinical setting. In this study, we hypothesize that fitting a computational iPSC-CM model to voltage-clamp (VC) data acquired before and after drug application provides a means of quantifying unknown drug effects on specific cardiac ion channels. We will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1) Use machine learning to design a novel VC protocol that improves the quality of data for hiPSC-CM model fitting. 2) Quantify the change in hiPSC-CM ion channel conductances before and after drug application. We will use machine learning to develop a novel voltage clamp protocol that improves the electrophysiology data acquired from our hiPSC-CMs. The data is optimized to improve predictions of the conductances for all ion channels activated during the cardiac action potential. We can apply this voltage clamp protocol in an in vitro setting before and after drug application, then fit our computational model to each dataset. The change in ion channel conductances, predicted by the model fit, serves as an estimate of the channel-specific effects of the drug. The contributions of this proposal will be significant because it will be the first study to use human cardiac cells to produce quantitative measurements of channel-specific drug targets that may lead to lethal cardiac arrhythmias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many promising drugs developed to treat a variety of diseases have undesirable effects on the heart, including increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Often, these drugs are not found to have adverse effects until they reach clinical trials, and failure of drugs at this stage of development is very costly. We aim to develop a method that leverages machine learning and human stem cell-derived heart cells to predict drug cardiotoxicity in a pre-clinical setting to substantially reduce the cost of the drug development process.",Predicting Drug Cardiotoxicity Targets Using iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes and Machine Learning,10068266,F31HL154655,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cavia', 'Cells', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Ion Channel', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standard Model', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'base', 'blood pump', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'human data', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'human subject', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sudden cardiac death', 'voltage', 'voltage clamp']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39120,91477866,0.0449040636356379
"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,9989245,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,0.04959837956667087
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9952362,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47875,117374875,0.08407358197481002
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,8428162,0.02856022268288008
"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network. The proposed investigation will advance this field by providing a large scale benchmark for evaluation as well as a predictive model based on state-of-the-art technology.",BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations,10054989,K99GM135488,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base Ratios', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Clinic', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'in silico', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'repository', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool']",NIGMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2020,100000,276703803,0.037287234094234054
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10164894,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100356,6676095,0.05540710703461366
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity-related and drug discovery endpoints. Our Phase I SBIR proposal called MegaTox will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo toxicity datasets. We propose using this technology to generate machine learning models for predicting potential compounds against either TGF- a target for countering chlorine induced lung inflammation as well as the adenosine A1 receptor to identify agonists as potential anticonvulsants. In addition, we can also compile molecules that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase which would enable the potential to discover medical countermeasures to address nerve agent and pesticide poisoning. We will access multiple machine learning approaches and validate these Bayesian or other machine learning models (including Linear Logistic Regression, AdaBoost Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and deep neural networks (DNN) of varying depth) with our own in-house technology for these selected targets. We will aim for ROC values greater than 0.75 and MCC and F1 scores that are acceptable (>0.3). These models will be used to virtually screen FDA approved drugs, clinical candidates, commercially available drugs or other molecules. We will select up to 50 molecules to be tested using in vitro assays alongside controls for each target. These combined efforts should in the first instance provide commercially viable treatments which will be used to experimentally validate our computational models that can be shared with the medical countermeasures scientific community. In summary, we are proposing to build and validate models for targets based on public databases, select compounds for testing, create proprietary data and use this as a starting point for further optimization of compounds if needed. Our goal is to identify at least one promising compound for each target that we then pursue and protect our IP. We will pursue additional grant funding to take these medical countermeasures through additional in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Ultimately, we will license our products to larger companies for development prior to clinical trials. Project Narrative There is an urgent need to develop medical countermeasures (MCM) to address pulmonary agents, nerve agents and organophosphorus pesticides. Our approach leverages public and private data to build machine learning models for different targets involved in the physiological effects of the aforementioned agents. We then use these computational models to select new molecules to test in vitro. Our approach builds on our MegaTox approach focused on modeling toxicology targets to specifically focus on identifying compounds for TGF-β and Adenosine A1 as well as potential AChE reactivators. This computational approach will be validated using in vitro testing and offers several advantages to identify potential novel or repurposed molecules as MCM including speed and cost-effectiveness.",MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems,10094026,R43ES031038,"['Acetylcholinesterase', 'Ache', 'Address', 'Adenosine', 'Adenosine A1 Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Chlorine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'FDA approved', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'In Vitro', 'Licensing', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Privatization', 'PubChem', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'base', 'clinical candidate', 'computational toxicology', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep neural network', 'drug discovery', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'novel', 'pesticide poisoning', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary agents', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2020,124915,280601,0.03848593769812653
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,9881199,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,137488,304670088,0.004754517449049263
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9966951,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2020,184375,45209062,0.017019142604948533
"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9868886,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'de-immunization', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2020,188164,80786674,0.03247445049838724
"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus. Results from these studies could prompt future clinical trials to test these regimens in humans for efficacy.",A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus,9898274,R21AI144536,"['Adjuvant', 'American', 'Amikacin', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bronchiectasis', 'Caring', 'Chest', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Antibiotics', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Imipenem', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrolides', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium Infections', 'Mycobacterium abscessus', 'Mycobacterium avium Complex', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'New Agents', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Regimen', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Triage', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Tuberculosis', 'Veins', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'comorbidity', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'data registry', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'model building', 'non-tuberculosis mycobacteria', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient screening', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical trial', 'predictive modeling', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'treatment optimization']",NIAID,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,212873,97658273,0.010611954451535404
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,10021688,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,252470,6676095,0.05540710703461366
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9908105,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,291940,81181560,0.04891705659237265
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9857604,R01GM108340,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'virtual screening', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,313000,570146095,0.0896824647903172
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Finding new drugs in the seas of small molecules is a difficult task if no prior information is available. Our broad research goal is to develop innovative and accurate machine learning algorithms to predict the drug responses related to complex human diseases. Specifically, we pursue questions of how a cell line responds to a single drug and combinatorial therapies, from the perspective of biological networks and small-molecule chemoinformatics. One research goal is to understand and predict the cell line-specific responses through integrating a wide range of methods, including the propagation of drug effects via biological networks, matrix factorization of molecular profiles and chemoinformatic analysis of small molecules. We will deploy our algorithms to softwares and web servers, which will inform the downstream experimental design to identify the single and combinatorial drug candidates against human diseases. Our research program will contribute to accelerate the drug discovery process by in silico screening through large amount of potent chemicals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Molecular targeted therapy is one of the most successful weapons against many complex human diseases.

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9963288,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,384165,91477866,0.06647454054357248
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,9932088,R35GM136409,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,391207,63611576,0.08672181638719592
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,329565273,0.027888894552265862
"Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive. ADRS driven by immune-mediated hypersensitivity (including rashes, hepatotoxicity, and Steven-Johnson syndrome) are the most difficult to predict and occasionally can be severe as well as fatal. Hypersensitivity-driven ADRs are the leading cause of drug withdrawal and termination of clinical development. Yet a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid these ADRs entirely if reliable models of bioactivation existed. Accurate prediction and identification of molecules prone to ADRs would revolutionize drug development by screening out ADR-prone candidates early, before exposure to patients, and guiding drug modifications to reduce ADR risk. Small molecules are not intrinsically immunogenic and instead, involve bioactivation into reactive metabolite is that then covalently modify proteins to create immunogenic antigens. “Structural alerts” are molecular substructures prone to bioactivation, and they are often used to identify small molecules prone to bioactivation, and at risk of bioactivation-mediated ADRs. Currently, bioactivation relevant alerts are defined by experts, and they have important limitations that this study overcomes. It is now possible to predict metabolism and reactivity and toxicity using machine learning approaches. Building on this foundation, this proposal systematically discovers new structural alerts by explicitly modeling the impact of metabolism on reactivity and hence the potential to form ADR-relevant adducts. We hypothesize that (1) known bioactivation reactions, (2) molecule citation data, and (3) new substructure mining algorithms can be used to identify emerging structural alerts. Aim 1. We will test this hypothesis by using a computational approach to systematically mine structural alerts from databases of known metabolism and reactivity reactions. Aim 2. We will computationally and experimentally validate structural alerts and assess their structural contingencies. Structural alerts are only conditionally bioactivated, depending on the precise molecule they appear. Newly proposed structural alerts, moreover, are most useful when there is experimental evidence that they in fact can be bioactivated.  PubHlthRel: Structural alerts discovered in this study will help scientists avoid toxic molecules in drug development, and better understand why medicines on the market become toxic. Overcoming a fundamental limitation with structural alerts, machine learning models of bioactivation will clarify in which molecules alerts are and are not bioactivated. This knowledge will help scientists make safer medicines in the future, modify existing medicines to make them safer, and reduce ADRs by using existing medicines more safely. Modified Public Health Relevance Section  Some medicines cause dangerous and expensive Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and many of these ADRs are caused by bioactivation. Structural alerts are substructures prone to bioactivation, and scientists use them to identify molecules prone to bioactivation mediated ADRs. Using a combined data-mining and experimental approach, this proposal systematically discovers emerging structural alerts of increased importance in recently studied molecules. Knowledge gained from these studies could foster improved dosing regimens for marketed drugs and enable scientists to design safer medicines.",Systematic Discovery of Bioactivation-Associated Structural Alerts,10143838,R01GM140635,"['Acute Liver Failure', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Binding Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'adduct', 'adverse drug reaction', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug market', 'drug modification', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver injury', 'mathematical model', 'protein function', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395313,533594881,0.04247058568302414
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,176988430,0.03467922454141525
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Drug repurposing for cocaine use disorder (CUD) using a combined strategy of  artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction and retrospective clinical corroboration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aim 1: Identify repurposed anti-CUD drug candidates using an AI-powered drug discovery approach Leveraging the unique and large-scale drug and disease phenotypic relationship knowledge bases that we have built and vast amounts of publicly available genetics and genomics data, we propose to develop an AI- powered drug repurposing system to identify anti-CUD drug candidates from all approved drugs. The output from Aim 1 is a list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action. Aim 2: Fine tune repurposed candidates by predicting their blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability We will determine the BBB permeability of repurposed anti-CUD candidates identified in Aim 1 using a novel machine learning predictive model that we built, which applies to both small and macro-molecules that penetrate the human BBB through various biological mechanisms. The output from Aim 2 is a refined list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action and high BBB permeability in humans. Aim 3: Evaluate repurposed candidates using patient electronic health records (EHRs) We will evaluate repurposed anti-CUD candidates for their efficacy in ‘real world’ patients using patient electronic health record (EHR) data. Currently we have access to EHR data of 73.9 million unique patients including 223,460 patients diagnosed with CUD and 66,050 patients with a cocaine-positive urine drug screen. We will perform large-scale case-control studies to evaluate the efficacy of repurposed candidates in reducing risk, mortality, relapse, ER visits or other adverse effects of CUD patients. The output from Aim 3 is a further refined list of promising repurposed anti-CUD candidates with interpretable mechanisms of action, high BBB permeability in humans, and potential clinical efficacy in ‘real-world’ population. We will closely work with CTN and delineate the most expedient pathway to FDA approval for the identified candidates. We anticipate that these findings can be expeditiously translated into clinical trials in the CTN to benefit CUD patients.

"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,9932039,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2020,431776,641965656,0.10816394220543014
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9894822,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'statistical learning', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,473065,533302350,0.029612551843016127
"A Machine Learning Platform for Adaptive Chemical Screening Project Summary High-throughput screening remains the most common method to identify the primary chemical hits in chemical biology and drug discovery projects. However, large-scale screens are often financially out of reach for many academic labs. The resulting small screens of small chemical libraries often identify few confirmed hits, most of which are unsuitable for medicinal chemistry follow-up. There is a critical need for computational tools that can guide experimental screening at a reasonable cost while exploring far more chemicals. This proposal will develop a computational platform that can be applied to any target or phenotypic system to select compounds for experimental screening from virtual chemical libraries with a billion or more compounds. New machine learning and high-throughput computing methods will navigate this large chemical space strategically and efficiently, improving the quality of the identified compounds. The computationally guided screening can ultimately improve the chemical diversity, target specificity, and stability of the identified active compounds, accelerating and enabling drug discovery across NIH Institutes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that make chemical screening accessible to more research groups and enable drug discovery in any therapeutic area. Data science techniques can take advantage of existing public bioactivity data in PubChem to help prioritize chemical screening for a new target. In this technology development proposal, the researchers will 1) determine a general initial screening compound set, 2) develop a computationally-guided iterative screening system, and 3) create and experimentally validate an end-to-end high-throughput computing workflow that directs drug discovery for any new target. At each step, rigorous comparisons to experimental results and baseline models will ensure the methods are working as expected and offer capabilities that do not exist in the current state-of-the-art computational methods. The resulting computational platform will improve the efficiency of and reduce the barriers to chemical screening, ultimately making screening for new compounds available to academic research groups in ways and in places where it has previously been inaccessible. Project Narrative The proposed project is broadly relevant to public health as a critical advancement of technology to enable basic biomedical research across therapeutic areas. This effort creates a computational platform to reduce the overall cost and improve the quality of high-throughput screening in any chemical biology or drug discovery project, which will be rigorously compared to existing experimental techniques.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",9885647,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'genetic profiling', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,480849,685608202,0.021297220404022932
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,77336088,0.1036536888114449
"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9994932,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2020,495160,495160,0.09186452268801541
"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of myocardial infarction. More recently, proton pump inhibitors have been identified with a host of previously undetected serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease. Statistical analyses of several sorts of data have been undertaken in an effort to mitigate the morbitidy and mortality resulting from such side effects by accelerating their detection. These include data from adverse event reporting systems, Electronic Health Records (EHR) and administrative claims data, social media communication and consumer search logs. Each of these sources presents challenges related to data completeness, accuracy, quality and representation, as well as the potential for bias. Though methods for combining multiple data sources show some promise as a way to address their particular inadequacies, strongly correlated drug-event pairs emerging from secondary analysis of observational data must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications. As the availability of the prerequisite expertise is limited, there is a pressing need for new methods to distinguish plausibly causal relationships from the large number of false positive associations that may emerge from large-scale analysis of observational data. In the proposed research, we will develop automated methods through which large amounts of knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature are used to constrain the parameterization of predictive models of large data sets. These methods will leverage high-dimensional distributed vector representations of conceptual relations extracted from the literature to integrate extracted knowledge into predictive models of observational data. Our hypothesis is that the predictions that result from such joint models will be both biologically plausible and strongly associated, resulting in more accurate predictions than those that can be obtained through estimation of correlation from observational data alone. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively for accuracy against a set of drug/side-effect reference standards, and summatively for their ability to to predict label changes such as “black box” warnings using historical data and knowledge to estimate their “time-to-detection” of safety concerns. In addition, we will develop and evaluate an interactive interface permitting users to explore the evidence used by the resulting models to make predictions, by retrieving supporting assertions from the literature and statistics from observational data. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to draw robust inferences from observational clinical data. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify biologically plausible adverse drug events using both observational data and knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9872026,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,563248,91477866,0.03172443488622763
"Phenotypic assay for drug discovery and personalized medicine based on real-time vibrational spectroscopy enhanced by plasmonic metasurfaces Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a new spectroscopic technique – Time-dependent Infrared Reflection Spectroscopy Assay (TIRSA) – that will enable us to measure the real-time spectral response of a cell to various pharmacological compounds. The uniqueness of TIRSA is that it exploits infrared-reflective plasmonic (gold) metasurfaces to detect, as a function of time, biochemical changes in close proximity of cellular membranes, as well as cytoskeleton reorganization occurring. The optical spectra obtained over the course of several hours after administering the drug will be used to identify its effects on signaling pathways without any labels because vibrational fingerprints of biomolecules are the natural labels. Unlike time-consuming cytotoxic assays, the TIRSA can be potentially as short as several hours, thereby addressing one of the most serious deficiencies of phenotypic assays: their low throughput. Powerful techniques of machine learning (ML) will be used to process the enormous amount of biochemical information obtained by TIRSA, and to conduct supervised and unsupervised data analysis that will be based on large libraries of spectral cellular responses to single-target chemical compounds such as kinase inhibitors and others. New laser-based hardware for TIRSA will enable high sensitivity, time and space resolution.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,10004481,R44TR002527,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'melting', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2020,749928,1905060,0.07145506573092085
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. This proposal will continue development and deploy a computational platform that predict drug side effects' mechanisms for safer drug development and better patient outcomes. The predictive platform will be applied for improving cancer and psychiatric treatments.","Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects",9922312,R44GM121117,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Levodopa', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'computational platform', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'metabolomics', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-patent', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2020,754478,754478,0.05845489985589225
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9827520,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2020,848588,10159852,0.06547256012881308
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9846198,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,1140875,76545728,0.04682494677219052
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,185946435,-0.0036992488255507255
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,377931988,0.030041965422721226

conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

"High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes Project Summary All folded proteins continuously fluctuate between their low-energy native structures and higher-energy “hidden” conformations that can be partially or fully unfolded. Although each protein molecule passes through its high- energy conformations only a small fraction of the time, these states have major physiological consequences. Partially-folded states of natural proteins can lead to protein aggregation, organ failure, and death. Partially- folded states of therapeutic proteins can induce dangerous anti-drug antibodies. The energetic balance between the native, folded state and these diverse higher-energy states – in other words, the overall “energy landscape” – is thus critically important in protein aggregation and immunogenicity, as well as in allostery, signaling, off- target drug interactions and numerous other phenomena. Despite decades of research into energy landscapes our overall understanding is very limited: few proteins have been characterized in depth, accurate computational predictions are very challenging, and experimental measurements are expensive, slow, and labor-intensive. We propose a transformational approach to understand protein energy landscapes by integrating a new massively parallel experimental method, machine learning, and protein design. First, we are developing a new high-throughput assay using hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to measure energy landscapes for thousands of proteins in parallel. This method finally brings the study of protein energy landscapes into the “omics” age. Critically, these experiments reveal both the overall folding stability and the energies of conformational fluctuations in each protein. For a subset of proteins (tens to hundreds), these parallel experiments reveal the specific sites of conformational fluctuations as well. Using this approach, we will measure the energy landscapes of thousands of natural proteins and tens of thousands of computationally designed proteins custom-built to systematically probe how specific properties affect energy landscapes. We will then train machine learning models to predict energy landscapes from sequence and structure, as well as optimize physical force fields to accurately model high-energy protein states. We will also catalyze advances in modeling throughout the community by organizing large-scale competitions at blind prediction of energy landscapes. Finally, with these new predictive models in hand, we will pursue a unique application: the development of energetically-optimized screening libraries for therapeutic protein and biological probe discovery. This overcomes a major challenge in drug and probe development. In sum, this study provides the experimental and computational tools to bring hidden protein states to light quantitatively on a massive scale. This fundamentally shifts our perspective: instead of examining energy landscapes only when they cause problems, we can make energy landscape analysis a central tool in biology and bioengineering. Project Narrative All proteins continuously move between their folded state and “hidden” higher-energy states that can be partially or fully unfolded. These hidden states have an important impact on how proteins interact, how they become activated, and whether they aggregate. Here, we combine protein design with a totally new high-throughput experimental approach to reveal these high-energy states for thousands of proteins in parallel, and apply these advances to build a new generation of computational models of protein energetics.",High-throughput discovery of protein energy landscapes in natural and designed proteomes,10002881,DP2GM140927,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Hand', 'Hydrogen', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organ failure', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Time', 'Training', 'blind', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenicity', 'predictive modeling', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'screening', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,DP2,2020,2347906,367414121,0.09484622550525768
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9732293,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,31648,117374875,0.08407358197481002
"Proteomics of ciliopathy protein complexes Summary Ciliopathies are a diverse class of developmental diseases that can manifest as defects in kidney, skeletal, eye, heart, reproductive, or mental function. Many ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl, Joubert, and Meckel Gruber Syndromes, are caused by defects in the major protein complexes that characterize the ciliary compartment. At least 1,000 proteins are associated with cilia biogenesis and function; uncovering the principles of ciliary protein organization thus requires a large scale, systematic investigation. Our current human protein complex maps, while extensive, have only moderate coverage of ciliary proteins, warranting the collection of targeted experimental datasets. I will use comparative proteomic analysis of cilia from multiple organisms to determine deeply conserved protein-protein interactions likely to be critical to ciliary function in humans. Examining human biological systems in the context of their level of conservation across species is a productive route to distinguish biological signal from noise. My preliminary data on three ciliated species confirm that this approach is capable of identifying conserved ciliary protein complexes. If a pair of proteins are found in physical contact in diverse species, having survived speciation events and gene loss, it can be predicted that this physical interaction is important. First, using mass spectrometry, we will experimentally detect protein complexes within the cilia across a spectrum of eukaryotic organisms, broadly defining conserved ciliary proteins. Second, we will integrate our own experimental data, some of which we have already collected, with outside data to construct a system-wide map of conserved ciliary protein complexes. These conserved ciliary protein complexes are strongly predicted to be functionally important in humans, and potentially involved in human birth defects. Finally, we will test a targeted subset of proteins predicted to associate with known birth defect proteins in vivo using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have four candidate genes in hand, and will consider candidates from the prior aims as appropriate. This project will lead to a map of critical conserved ciliary protein complexes, a future primary resource for research into diverse ciliopathies. Project Narrative! Ciliopathies are a class of birth defects caused by defective cilia.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9995278,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CXCL11 gene', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Site', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,64234,81181560,0.04891705659237265
"MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models Summary Being able to predict interactions with important human transporters would be of value to new drug design to avoid compounds that interact with them and cause undesirable side effects. OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are `uptake' transporters largely restricted to the sinusoidal aspect of hepatocytes. They both transport a wide variety of structurally-unrelated compounds, including members of several clinically im- portant drug families such as statins, sartans and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. We now propose to test over 1000 drugs against 2 substrates for each transporter in vitro. We will then use these data to curate and validate machine learning models. We will also use an array of machine learning methods as well as multiple model evaluation metrics. This will enable us to develop a web-based software tool called MegaTrans that will encourage the user to input their own compound structures and generate predictions for interactions with transporter/s of interest and then visualize the similarity to the training set of each model using several different visualization methods. The return on investment of such a tool would be that it could assist in the design and selection of more favorable compounds that avoid transporters of interest while also saving time and money. It could also identify compounds that are already approved that might present a drug interaction risk. Predicting such behavior seen in vivo is ideal and will lead to the prioritization of compounds to test in vitro for potential drug-drug interactions. In Phase II we would greatly expand the number of transporters which we would generate data on and build models such that we could address all the major transporters of interest to drug discovery. Narrative The objective of “MegaTrans” is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating human trans- porter data into drug discovery pipelines, as well as enabling its analysis and visualization. This will then enable improved computational tool development for in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of xenobiotic exposures across a range of assay types. It will also assist with developing computational tools for quantitatively modeling drug-drug interactions of xenobiotics. Across Phase I and Phase II we will generate data for transporters which currently have a paucity of data in the public domain, use validated machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system to enable predictions.",MegaTrans – human transporter machine learning models,9768844,R41GM131433,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Modelings', 'Ensure', 'Estradiol', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescein', 'Glucuronides', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Kinetics', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Products', 'Online Systems', 'Organic Cation Transporter', 'Output', 'POU2F2 gene', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Xenobiotics', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'model building', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'software development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'uptake']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R41,2019,210712,280601,0.0794596616987913
"Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) – comprising the endocannabinoids, their G-protein coupled re- ceptors, and their metabolic enzymes – is one of the most important physiological systems involved in estab- lishing and maintaining human health. In some illnesses, ECS dysregulation is an element of disease pathol- ogy whereas in others it is believed to be protective. Thus, there is intense interest in developing pharma- cotherapies that target the ECS to blunt its pathologies or harness its protective effects. One of the main challenges in developing new drugs that target the ECS is the problem of side effects, con- sistent with the nearly ubiquitous expression of this signaling system. Current efforts to increase the functional specificity of ECS drugs include preventing them from crossing the blood brain barrier, and targeting ancillary ECS proteins which modulate principal ECS components without being direct effectors themselves. Until now, discovery of ancillary proteins has proceeded mainly by inference from prior knowledge obtained from isolated cells. This approach can be limiting because knowledge of the underlying genetic and biochemical networks is usually incomplete. Here we propose to develop new high-throughput methodologies to enable the first unbi- ased genetic screens to identify new ECS molecules in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is an omnivorous bacterivore but it learns to prefer some species of bacteria more than others. We recently discovered that one of the worm's endocannabinoids increases the worm’s appetite for favored foods over less favored foods, a phenomenon called hedonic amplification. We propose this system as a genetically tractable model of cannabinoid effects on appetitive behavior, providing an easily screenable phenotype that directly corresponds to a well-known human behavior. The research develops two high-throughput microfluidic systems for quantifying hedonic amplification in C. ele- gans. The systems are then utilized to perform two small-scale genetic screens as a prelude to future large- scale screens. In the first, hedonic amplification will be quantified in strains in which homologs of known mam- malian ECS components have been knocked out; this screen further validates the C. elegans ECS as a mam- malian model. In the second screen, hedonic amplification will be assessed in a select set of wild isolate strains of C. elegans to estimate the heritability of this phenotype. The research is significant because it could ultimately lead to the discovery of novel drug targets to mitigate disease and promote health. Cell-to-cell signaling mechanisms involving endocannabinoids are involved in numerous physiological and psy- chological conditions including nausea, obesity, pain, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders, and neu- rodegenerative disease where they can be part of the disease or the body's protective response to it. However, most attempts to harness the therapeutic potential of endocannabinoid signaling have been stymied by prob- lematic side effects. The proposed research develops and applies innovative methods to screen for genes en- coding new members of the endocannabinoid signaling system as potential drug targets for treatment of endo- cannabinoid-related diseases, with fewer and milder side effects.",Genetic analysis of endocannabinoid signaling in C. elegans,9650393,R21DA047645,"['Action Potentials', 'Anxiety', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cells', 'Chemotaxis', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzymes', 'Fire - disasters', 'Food', 'Food Preferences', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Invertebrates', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscle', 'Mutagenesis', 'Names', 'Nausea', 'Nematoda', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obesity', 'Operating System', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Organ', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'anandamide', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'endocannabinoid signaling', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'feeding', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic strain', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hedonic', 'innovation', 'interest', 'loss of function mutation', 'marijuana use disorder', 'member', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'performance tests', 'preference', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2019,220842,45209062,0.017019142604948533
"MegaTox for analyzing and visualizing data across different screening systems Project Summary Computational toxicology aims to use rules, models and algorithms based on prior data for specific endpoints, to enable the prediction of whether a new molecule will possess similar liabilities or not. In some cases, the computational models are derived from discrete molecular endpoints while in others they are quite broad in scope. Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade both in model development and availability such that the next generation of larger scale models will promote it to the next level and further focus in vitro and in vivo testing on verification of select predictions. Pharmaceutical, consumer products and other chemistry focused companies possess structure-activity data generated over many decades of screening that is not in the public domain, and this data is primarily only accessible to the cheminformatics experts in each company. Outside of these companies small biotechs and academics must rely on data from public databases, commercial databases and their own data. Integrating such data and processing it to build algorithms that can help with predictive models is a vast undertaking. Our recent efforts have used sources like PubChem and ChEMBL to build predictive models for different toxicity related and drug discovery endpoints. Drug companies tend to focus on target related information whereas there might be an opportunity to understand toxicity also. Our work with a consumer product company indicated the need for accessing machine learning models based on the growing public datasets could be a commercially viable product. Without massive legacy internal data many of small drug discovery and consumer product companies will have to make do with data accessible in PubChem, ChEMBL or other public databases (ToxCast, Tox21 etc) only. In this proposal we will provide toxicity machine learning models developed with different algorithms (Bayesian, Support vector machines, random forest and Deep Neural Networks as just some examples) for 40-50 in vitro and in vivo datasets. We are not aware of any other company pursuing such an approach to create as wide an array of toxicity models. We are also not aware of other software companies in the toxicity model space generating their own experimental data to test the models. Such a technology could have very broad utility for other pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, consumer product companies, regulatory groups and academic research groups. As we have been working for several years to build up technologies and experience in cheminformatics and software development it would be relatively straightforward for us to build the core foundations of MegaTox and deliver them to potential customers. This technology will also be used in our consulting projects with pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. Project Narrative The objective of ‘MegaTox’ is to develop a new computational system and tools for integrating toxicity data, and machine learning models. This will enable the prediction of various toxicity endpoints relevant to pharmaceutical and consumer product companies. We will use the latest machine learning algorithms, access the latest curated public datasets and develop a user intuitive interface and visualization system. We will use MegaTox internally for our own drug discovery projects as well as leverage it for consulting for clients so we can combine public and private datasets and increase the coverage of chemical property space.

"Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins Abstract Immune responses to therapeutic proteins can pose enormous problems for the patient causing either adverse events or loss of efficacy. As therapeutic proteins represent one of the fastest-growing class of pharmaceuticals, it is vital to evaluate whether a protein is likely immunogenic early in the drug development stage and also to have methods available to re-design potential leads to eliminate immune response-causing epitopes. Equally important—yet demanding the opposite effect—is the design of broadly specific vaccines, where increased immunogenicity of subdominant conserved immunogens is desired. The adaptive immune response entails formation of a complex between a T-cell receptor (TCR) and a “foreign” peptide bound to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule that is presented on an antigen presenting cell - a crucial step for the induction of high-titer IgG responses if CD4+ T helper cells become activated. De-immunization efforts of therapeutic proteins have mostly relied on experimental characterization of a large number of point mutants followed by laborious single peptide analysis assays. Data on of over 330,000 experimentally verified T-cell immuno-reactive peptides has been integration and used to predict new epitopes and to bias the computational re-design of a protein to eliminate T-cell epitopes. While this represents a promising strategy, improvements are still needed and no design approach to date is available to systematically incorporate optimized T-cell epitopes to increase immunogenicity. We propose to develop a novel computational design approach capable of reducing immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins or alternatively increasing immunogenicity of vaccine immunogens without disrupting proper folding or function. As proof of concept, we will demonstrate the ability of this approach to 1) reduce immunogenicity of a novel influenza protein therapeutic and 2) increase immunogenicity of influenza's hemagglutinin's stem-region. Finally, we will establish an in vitro high-throughput strategy to evaluate tiled peptide arrays derived from the re-designed proteins or viral surface proteins for the following characteristics: (a) immuno-reactivity, as defined by their ability to form a MHC-peptide complex and (b) ability to activate T-cells. Our approach will take advantage of oligonucleotide-chip technology and next-generation sequencing, enabling the screening of thousands of peptides in parallel. If successful, this strategy will provide a general computational protein design pipeline for reshaping the immunogenicity of proteins and immunogens as well as a two-level experimental verification platform for T-cell epitopes. Narrative The objective of this proposal is to establish a robust platform using both experimental and computational methods that enables the quick and facile identification, verification and re-design immune-reactive epitopes with the goal to either eliminate or introduce T-cell stimulating epitopes. The latter is applicable for the development of either therapeutics or immunogens for vaccination. We will use novel influenza therapeutics and universal vaccines as proof of concept.",Reshaping Immunogenicity of Proteins,9647931,R21AI143399,"['Adverse event', 'Alleles', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza Therapeutic', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Procedures', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Yeasts', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'large scale production', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein complex', 'response', 'screening', 'stem', 'therapeutic protein', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R21,2019,225875,80786674,0.03247445049838724
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,9694695,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual', 'virtual technology']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,235391,68045551,0.0773736218923487
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9988741,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,238632,91477866,0.03172443488622763
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,9740715,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,244161,6676095,0.05540710703461366
"Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Affordable high-throughput genome sequencing technologies had been expected to usher an era of precision medicine, whereby each patient receives an individualized treatment based on their genetic profile. However, precision medicine is yet to realize this potential and the number of clinically applied drug biomarkers lags far behind the number proposed in the scientific literature. Lack of reproducibility of proposed biomarkers has been highly problematic, and in particular the lack of effectiveness of biomarkers identified in pre-clinical studies when applied in clinical trial. In cancer, the number of drugs with FDA approved biomarkers remains at less than 30, and almost all of these arose because a drug was designed to target a specific known driver gene. Overall, only a handful of clinically actionable biomarkers have been discovered for drugs already in use. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods that will improve on existing biomarker discovery, and ultimately improve patient care and survival. My first aim is to develop an approach that will allow me to impute drug sensitivity in very large clinical datasets, such as TCGA. This imputed data will then be compared to measured markers in these data (e.g. somatic mutations) in order to identify novel predictors of drug response. The statistical models used to impute drug sensitivity will be developed in a pre-clinical disease model, where drug response has been accurately measured. In my second aim I will quantify the contribution of germline genetic variation to drug response in cancer. “Germline genetic variation” refers to the common genetic differences that exist between individuals, which are for the most part preserved in tumors. The contribution of this inter-individual genetic variation to variability in drug response between patients remains unquantified, although it is becoming clearer that it plays an important role. Finally, I will combine the information gathered in the first steps and build effective integrative models of drug response. Following the R00 phase (R01 and beyond), I envision that such models will be tested in patients; subsequently, measured drug response in these cohorts will be used to further refine future predictions. This will result in a framework where models actively improve their predictive performance as more data is gathered over time. To ensure the success of this project, I have assembled an expert mentorship team for the K99 phase, which includes a statistician, wet-lab biologists and clinicians, thus covering the entire scope of the precision medicine discovery and implementation pipeline. The University of Chicago, a world-class research institution, will provide the ideal environment and resources for such a cross-disciplinary, collaborative endeavor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite enormous investment in precision medicine, most drug repurposing and biomarker discovery strategies have failed when applied in the clinic. This project will improve drug treatments by developing novel computational methods that will allow us to find new biomarkers and to better predict which patients will respond to what drugs, with application to cancer. The novel approach is based on integrating clinical sequencing and pre-clinical drug screening datasets.",Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery,9836955,R00HG009679,"['Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft Model', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted agent', 'theories', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,ST.

"A pipeline for prioritizing and evaluating multidrug regimens for Mycobacterium abscessus PROJECT SUMMARY Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is a group of closely related nontuberculous mycobacteria, which primarily cause infections in persons with underlying lung disease, compromised immunity or other risk factors. MABSC organisms are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and treatment requires many months of multiple antibiotics, often with significant toxicity and low cure rates. One of the difficulties in optimizing the treatment of MABSC infections is the lack of a robust pipeline for the identification of multidrug regimens that may be more efficacious than the current standard of care. A strategy for prioritizing multidrug regimens is necessary, because the number of combinations to test can be overwhelming. For example, with even just 12 drugs to select from there are 220 potential 3 drug combinations. This project proposes to develop INDIGO (INferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning modeling approach, to identify drug combinations with strong potential synergistic activity against MABSC and to test these regimens in an animal model. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Build and refine an INDIGO-MABSC model through the collection of transcriptomic data from drug treated MABSC cultures, subsequent experimental verification of antibiotic synergy and antagonism followed by model refinement with iterative rounds of model building and testing; 2) Assess the efficacy of top predicted synergistic multidrug regimens in a zebrafish model for MABSC infection. INDIGO modeling is modular, so as new agents become available they may be incorporated into the model to make predictions for how these agents may be best combined into multidrug regimens. The overall goal of this project is to provide a streamlined pipeline for identifying regimens that can be pushed into advanced pre-clinical and clinical trials for treatment of MABSC infections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bacteria from the Mycobacterium abscessus group cause lung and other infections in persons with underlying medical comorbidities, which are incredibly difficult to treat due to the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. This project uses gene expression profiling, computer modeling, and a zebrafish infection model to identify new combination antibiotic regimens that may be more effective against Mycobacterium abscessus.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9720905,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,291940,81181560,0.04891705659237265
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,77336088,0.1036536888114449
"A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data Human monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing therapeutic modalities, with over sixty compounds approved by FDA to treat infections, autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In combination, these diseases are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people annually, according to the World Health Organization. However, the advent of therapeutic immunologics is expected to significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality, particularly for oncologic diseases. Currently, 15 immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments are commercially available and comprise a growing market that is expected to reach $100B by 2022. IO therapeutics effectively attack cancer by selectively binding tumor-specific protein domains on the cell surface, referred to as tumor-associated ectodomains (TAEs). However, many cancers remain insensitive to available IO as effective and safe TAEs are difficult to identify. Standard methods to detect TAEs are costly, time-consuming and limited in their ability to discover novel targets, necessitating the development of innovative technologies to circumvent this burden. RNAseq is currently the most effective method to discover novel splicing isoforms, is high-throughput, sensitive and inexpensive. Envisagenics has been at the forefront of RNAseq- based splicing characterization since the release of its SpliceCore® platform. Here, we propose to develop SpliceIO, a novel drug discovery platform that integrates the Envisagenics’ SpliceCore knowledge base with machine learning algorithms to enable rapid identification of aberrant splicing-derived TAEs using RNAseq data. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will develop and apply SpliceIO in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a cancer particularly resistant to IO but highly associated with splicing mis-regulation and mutations within key spliceosome components. We will identify and validate TAEs in vitro using established leukemia cell lines and patient-derived bone marrow aspirates in collaboration with Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Collectively, the aims outlined herein will allow us to both develop and validate a novel splicing-dependent TAE identification platform to provide new sources of drug targets while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with their development. In addition, this will allow Envisagenics to create new partnership opportunities for IO co- development with pharmaceutical companies. If successful, this pipeline can be used to identify drug targets and/or biomarkers for patient stratification in cancer and inflammatory diseases in the context of an SBIR Phase II grant. Despite the recent success of immune-based treatments in melanoma, the majority of cancers remain insensitive and resistant to therapy, necessitating the development of approaches to rapidly identify novel drug targets. Here, we propose to build a target discovery platform that combines our proprietary database of RNA splicing mutations in cancers with machine learning to identify the most clinically-relevant targets for subsequent drug development.",A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data,9909639,R43CA246950,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Databases', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor-Derived', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immunogenic', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,301502,0,0.014968750893714989
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9774233,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,303137,232986943,0.02248812805891995
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9634985,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,313000,570146095,0.0896824647903172
"The Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) ABSTRACT  Transporters catalyze entry and exit of molecules into and out of cells and organelles. They achieve cellular homeostasis, are responsible for multidrug resistance in pathogens and tumors, and, when defective, cause dozens of important human genetic diseases. Our laboratory maintains, updates and improves the Transporter Classification Database, TCDB, which houses the Transporter Classification (TC) system, adopted officially by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB). TCDB is the internationally acclaimed, carefully annotated, universal standard for classifying and providing information about transporters and transport-related proteins in all major domains of life. It presents sequence, biochemical, physiological, pathological, structural and evolutionary data about these proteins and the transport systems they comprise. It uses a successful system of classification based on transporter class, subclass, family, subfamily, individual transport system and constituent proteins. It also includes a superfamily hyperlink.  In this competitive renewal of GM0077402, we propose to continue to expand, update, and semi-automate TCDB. Our specific aims are to (1) upgrade TCDB by characterizing and categorizing protein domains and their topologies, motifs, repeat units, functional interactions, alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, (2) expand TCDB by implementing novel pipelines for data entry that will increase the coverage of transport diversity in TCDB while describing more effectively the complexity of multicomponent transport systems, (3) enter into TCDB transporter modulators such as activators, inhibitors, drugs and xenobiotics as well as internal and external conditions that influence transporter activities, while generating an ontology to describe the effects of chemical modulators that will complement our substrate ontology, (4) incorporate into TCDB synthetic pores/channels (TC subclass 1.D), and carriers (TC subclass 2.B), (5) introduce into TCDB connections between transport and metabolism and (6) expand our plans for long-term TCDB sustainability. PROJECT NARRATIVE  TCDB is the only IUBMB-approved database providing the worldwide scientific community with systematic information about proteins that catalyze transmembrane transport. Transport proteins play critical roles in health-related issues such as personalized medicine, cancer, drug development, bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions.

"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data.

"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9742516,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'adverse drug reaction', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,374026,533594881,0.06030235433168574
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9731549,R01GM124559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,384166,91477866,0.06647454054357248
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,329565273,0.027888894552265862
"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells.

"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,8428162,0.02856022268288008
"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9712954,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine vision', 'member', 'neural network', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,459955,533302350,0.029612551843016127
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Robust Inference from Observational Data with Distributed Representations of Conceptual Relations The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of myocardial infarction. More recently, proton pump inhibitors have been identified with a host of previously undetected serious side effects, including chronic kidney disease. Statistical analyses of several sorts of data have been undertaken in an effort to mitigate the morbitidy and mortality resulting from such side effects by accelerating their detection. These include data from adverse event reporting systems, Electronic Health Records (EHR) and administrative claims data, social media communication and consumer search logs. Each of these sources presents challenges related to data completeness, accuracy, quality and representation, as well as the potential for bias. Though methods for combining multiple data sources show some promise as a way to address their particular inadequacies, strongly correlated drug-event pairs emerging from secondary analysis of observational data must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications. As the availability of the prerequisite expertise is limited, there is a pressing need for new methods to distinguish plausibly causal relationships from the large number of false positive associations that may emerge from large-scale analysis of observational data. In the proposed research, we will develop automated methods through which large amounts of knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature are used to constrain the parameterization of predictive models of large data sets. These methods will leverage high-dimensional distributed vector representations of conceptual relations extracted from the literature to integrate extracted knowledge into predictive models of observational data. Our hypothesis is that the predictions that result from such joint models will be both biologically plausible and strongly associated, resulting in more accurate predictions than those that can be obtained through estimation of correlation from observational data alone. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively for accuracy against a set of drug/side-effect reference standards, and summatively for their ability to to predict label changes such as “black box” warnings using historical data and knowledge to estimate their “time-to-detection” of safety concerns. In addition, we will develop and evaluate an interactive interface permitting users to explore the evidence used by the resulting models to make predictions, by retrieving supporting assertions from the literature and statistics from observational data. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to draw robust inferences from observational clinical data. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify biologically plausible adverse drug events using both observational data and knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9629970,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,563248,91477866,0.03172443488622763
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics.

The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9751326,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Industry Standard', 'Intelligence', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'computational suite', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2019,692845,280601,0.050538768415239875
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9608807,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'robotic system', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2019,754441,1905060,0.035836116395305546
"Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects Project Summary Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), more commonly known as drug side effects, are estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. ADRs are estimated to increase healthcare costs by $136 billion per year in the USA alone. Current safety and modeling efforts that are commonly used in the pharma industry (such as PK/PD) do not elucidate the complex pathophysiology underlying ADRs. These safety and modeling approaches are used predominantly to quantitatively understand exposure-response relationships for clinical dosing, but with a few exceptions do not focus on the cellular pharmacodynamic mechanisms of why drugs cause ADRs. Elucidating the downstream and systemic effects of pharmaceuticals is critical to understanding ADR pathogenesis and developing safer therapies. Drugs can affect multiple proteins and each protein that they modulate may play roles in multiple cellular processes. Systems biology and bioinformatics approaches coupled with machine learning are crucial for understanding the multi-factorial pathophysiology of ADRs. In Phase I of this program, we developed an in vitro transcriptomics based computational platform that 1) predicts drug-side effect liability equivalent to current gold-standard approaches that require considerably more information about the compound and its effects, 2) defines genes that are relevant to ADR pathophysiology, and 3) identifies therapeutically beneficial compounds for the ADR. Based on the computational platform, we discovered a repurposing opportunity for an off-patent, non-FDA approved drug in Parkinson’s Disease that we are currently pursuing towards clinical development. This drug significantly improves levodopa’s efficacy, without exacerbating the drug’s major side effect which often precludes levodopa’s use. In Phase II of this proposal, we will continue to develop and expand the ADR computational platform. Further, we will hone our focus on two key clinically and commercially relevant ADRs: antipsychotic induced tardive dyskinesia and radio-/chemo- therapy induced mucosal inflammation. We will generate rich datasets for these ADRs to both validate our in vitro platform with in vivo data and to understand the pathophysiology of these ADRs at an unprecedented level. Further, we will use the datasets to generate computational predictions for discovering/repurposing drugs to improve safety in psychiatric and cancer treatments. The best predictions will be subsequently tested in vitro and developed through partnerships and external funding mechanisms. Project Narrative Adverse drug reactions, more commonly known as drug side effects, cause over 200,000 deaths in the US annually, are responsible for 6.5% of all hospital admissions, and 28% of clinical trial failures. This proposal will continue development and deploy a computational platform that predict drug side effects' mechanisms for safer drug development and better patient outcomes. The predictive platform will be applied for improving cancer and psychiatric treatments.","Developing a systems biology platform for predicting, preventing, and treating drug side effects",9777393,R44GM121117,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion', 'Levodopa', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Radio', 'Reporting', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tardive Dyskinesia', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'computational platform', 'data pipeline', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'metabolomics', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-patent', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,"SINOPIA BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2019,802538,754478,0.05845489985589225
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9594144,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2019,902060,10159852,0.06547256012881308
"Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database PROJECT SUMMARY Therapeutic antibodies, specialized enzymes for drug manufacturing, small molecule drug screening agents, and other proteins have been instrumental in advancing biotechnology and medicine. Protein therapeutics alone represents a rapidly growing $100+ billion market with broad applications in the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and numerous other disorders. Most of the antibodies and other protein therapeutics developed in the last several years have been engineered, leading to improvements in important properties such as efficacy, binding affinity, expression, stability, and immunogenicity. However, improving protein properties through sequence modification remains a challenging task. Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been enormously successful in several fields (e.g., image recognition, self-driving cars, natural language processing), is now being applied to protein engineering and has the potential to transform this field as well. AI and machine learning (ML) can take advantage of large and diverse datasets to identify correlations, predict beneficial mutations, and explore novel protein sequences in ways that are not possible using other techniques. Other advantages include the ability to simultaneously optimize multiple protein properties and explore sequence space more efficiently. In Phases I and II of this project, we developed the ProtaBank database as a central repository to store, organize, and annotate protein mutation data spanning a broad range of properties. ProtaBank is the largest and only database actively collecting such a comprehensive set of sequence mutation data and is growing rapidly due to the wealth of data being generated with advanced automation and next-generation sequencing techniques. ProtaBank's depth and breadth makes it an ideal data source to train ML models. This proposal aims to create the ProtaBank AI Platform to enable the use of AI and ML tools to apply the data in ProtaBank to engineer proteins. The platform will provide fully customizable computational tools and will invoke protein-specific knowledge to properly prepare data for use with ML models. An interface to popular ML frameworks will be provided so that scientists can use these techniques to discover new predictive algorithms and enhance their ability to design proteins with the desired properties. Specific aims include: (1) integrating peer validated ML methods and proprietary technology for protein engineering into the ProtaBank AI Platform, (2) developing dynamic ML dataset creation tools, (3) expanding and improving the ProtaBank database by reaching out to scientists to contribute data, (4) enhancing our data deposition tools, and (5) integrating ProtaBank with the Protein Data Bank structure database and other databases. ! Project Narrative Protein engineering has enabled significant advances in health care by playing a key role in the development of antibodies and other protein therapeutics (e.g., for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory and metabolic diseases, and other disorders), highly selective enzymes for drug manufacturing, and novel proteins for use in diagnostics and the identification of new small molecule drugs. This project will enable the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to be applied to accelerate the engineering of proteins with new and improved properties. AI approaches can capitalize on the large amounts of protein mutation data being generated and stored in our recently developed ProtaBank protein mutation database to transform the way in which protein therapeutics and reagents are discovered and developed.!",Advancing Protein Engineering Using Artificial Intelligence and the ProtaBank Mutation Database,9847841,R44GM117961,"['Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Meteor', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Training', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'data submission', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'peer', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,"PROTABIT, LLC",R44,2019,990318,495160,0.09186452268801541
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9640405,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,1140875,76545728,0.04682494677219052
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,185946435,-0.0036992488255507255
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary

have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy

systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate

priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected

(tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the

This research will be propelled by discoveries from the Wolozin laboratory demonstrating that a dynamic network of protein interactions drives tau biology and changes with the course of disease. Interpreting these perturbed assembly networks, though, demands knowledge of the localization and compositional specificity of such complexes. The unbiased interactome screening technology developed by the Emili laboratory is uniquely suited for unbiased interrogations of synaptic protein networks. We hypothesize that selective disruption of specific synaptic protein assemblies mediates the functional degeneration associated with tauopathy. Aim 1 will determine how synaptic protein complexes differ between general cortical and cholinergic neurons. We will isolate and biochemical separate synaptic assemblies from total cortical and cholinergic (ChAT::GFP) synapses, using FACS to further purify ChAT:GFP synapses. Separated assemblies will be characterized by precision mass spectrometry and integrative data mining (machine learning) procedures to determine their composition and post- translational modification states, and to map dynamically changing interactions implicated in altered synaptic function during normal aging. Aim 2 will determine how the macromolecular structures of synaptic protein assemblies change with aging and AD. We will analyze cortical synaptosomal complexes from P301S tau and P301S tau x TIA1+/- mice, the latter which exhibited delayed degeneration. Key drivers in synaptic dysfunction will be identified and verified in AD and control human samples by co-immunoprecipitation. Aim 3 will identify complexes that are critical drivers of synaptic function by disrupting prioritized assemblies using genetic and opticogenetic tools. This work will determine key regulators of synaptic function in health and disease, and will also produce expanded genetic tools and outstanding targets for future approaches using bio-engineered regulation.

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9607906,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Hospitalization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,31156,117374875,0.08407358197481002
"Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are macromolecules that carry out innumerable biological functions ranging from intracellular signaling to immune response. The specific function of a protein is determined by its three-dimensional structure. Therefore, an essential step towards understanding protein function is elucidating protein structure. However, the premier method for structure determination, X-ray crystallography, can be limited by many potential factors including the quality of the protein crystal. The proposed research will investigate the effects of protein– protein interactions in the crystal lattice on crystal quality and resolution and develop a design approach to stabilize lattice interactions, which should result in higher-quality crystals.  First, the molecular determinants of high-quality protein crystal structures will be identified by (1) curating a set of representative structures from the Protein Data Bank, (2) extracting relevant features, such as interaction energy, buried solvent accessible surface area, interfacial packing quality, and residue usage, and (3) analyzing the features’ relationship to crystal resolution (a proxy for quality). Based on these findings, a design strategy and score function for ranking designs within the Rosetta framework will be developed.  Second, the design strategy will be applied to SNase, a model protein that is easy to purify and well- behaved in crystallization and diffraction experiments. The designed proteins will be crystallized and the crystal structures will be solved, testing for improved resolution. Analysis of the resultant crystal structures will drive development of the design strategy.  Third, the design strategy will be applied on a bacterial gyrase, an antibiotic-target protein for which there are several drug-bound structures at low resolution, lacking sufficient detail to reveal key antibiotic– gyrase interactions. Preliminary data suggests that the designed gyrase mutants will yield high-resolution structures, permitting a better understanding of antibiotic–gyrase interactions, with implications for drug design.  Should the method be successful, it will be immediately applicable to ~26,000 structures in the Protein Data Bank, and countless structures that have not been published due to lack of resolution. Re-engineered, high-resolution structures of these proteins could yield structural data on molecular interactions pertinent to disease, drug development, and basic understanding of protein function. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop methods to improve low-resolution crystal structures of proteins to high-resolution sufficient (1) to resolve key mechanistic features of enzyme function and disease, and (2) to design or screen drug molecules. In addition to method development, we will pursue crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DNA gyrase in complex with relevant antibiotic drugs.",Computational Design of Crystal Lattice Interactions to Determine Recalcitrant Protein Structures,9644449,F31GM123616,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'DNA Gyrase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Free Energy', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solvents', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'functional gain', 'improved', 'insight', 'interfacial', 'macromolecule', 'method development', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'research and development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,37308,807432003,0.08201451975373363
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9600183,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'microphysiology system', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ on a chip', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'testing services']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2018,39927,227946,0.054049233762116095
"Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Affordable high-throughput genome sequencing technologies had been expected to usher an era of precision medicine, whereby each patient receives an individualized treatment based on their genetic profile. However, precision medicine is yet to realize this potential and the number of clinically applied drug biomarkers lags far behind the number proposed in the scientific literature. Lack of reproducibility of proposed biomarkers has been highly problematic, and in particular the lack of effectiveness of biomarkers identified in pre-clinical studies when applied in clinical trial. In cancer, the number of drugs with FDA approved biomarkers remains at less than 30, and almost all of these arose because a drug was designed to target a specific known driver gene. Overall, only a handful of clinically actionable biomarkers have been discovered for drugs already in use. The objective of this project is to develop computational methods that will improve on existing biomarker discovery, and ultimately improve patient care and survival. My first aim is to develop an approach that will allow me to impute drug sensitivity in very large clinical datasets, such as TCGA. This imputed data will then be compared to measured markers in these data (e.g. somatic mutations) in order to identify novel predictors of drug response. The statistical models used to impute drug sensitivity will be developed in a pre-clinical disease model, where drug response has been accurately measured. In my second aim I will quantify the contribution of germline genetic variation to drug response in cancer. “Germline genetic variation” refers to the common genetic differences that exist between individuals, which are for the most part preserved in tumors. The contribution of this inter-individual genetic variation to variability in drug response between patients remains unquantified, although it is becoming clearer that it plays an important role. Finally, I will combine the information gathered in the first steps and build effective integrative models of drug response. Following the R00 phase (R01 and beyond), I envision that such models will be tested in patients; subsequently, measured drug response in these cohorts will be used to further refine future predictions. This will result in a framework where models actively improve their predictive performance as more data is gathered over time. To ensure the success of this project, I have assembled an expert mentorship team for the K99 phase, which includes a statistician, wet-lab biologists and clinicians, thus covering the entire scope of the precision medicine discovery and implementation pipeline. The University of Chicago, a world-class research institution, will provide the ideal environment and resources for such a cross-disciplinary, collaborative endeavor. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite enormous investment in precision medicine, most drug repurposing and biomarker discovery strategies have failed when applied in the clinic. This project will improve drug treatments by developing novel computational methods that will allow us to find new biomarkers and to better predict which patients will respond to what drugs, with application to cancer. The novel approach is based on integrating clinical sequencing and pre-clinical drug screening datasets.",Novel computational approaches for pharmacogenomic discovery,9453364,K99HG009679,"['Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Modelings', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Xenograft Model', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytotoxic', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted agent', 'theories', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K99,2018,84597,246330700,0.031131673000541784
"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies SUMMARY Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. NARRATIVE The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9702305,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,99500,91477866,0.0316529181169633
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9693353,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,137386,232986943,0.02248812805891995
"Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets PROJECT SUMMARY Drugs act by altering the activities of particular components (targets) within a cell or organism. Thus, drug discovery campaigns begin by identifying a target, followed by screening this target with compounds to identify leads that can be developed into a drug. Unfortunately, identifying effective drug targets for a given disease, let alone for individual patients (e.g. in highly heterogeneous cancers) is an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. As a result, drugs are frequently developed against incorrect or suboptimal targets, and end up showing no clinical efficacy. Powerful genomic technologies have paved the way for much of the modern understanding of molecular biology, but they have not proven efficient at identifying drug targets. Phenotypic screening, which identifies efficacious drugs by screening compounds directly on cells, has thus regained popularity. In phenotypic screening, however, the targets are typically unknown. We are developing an innovative biotechnology platform that directly identifies effective pharmacological targets from cellular disease models by combining the two approaches, target- based and phenotypic-based screening. This is accomplished with the use of a highly annotated chemical library and sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The compounds are screened in a cell-based assay, and the phenotypic readouts are analyzed in relation to the compounds’ biochemical activities, revealing the candidate targets that are mediating the therapeutic activity of effective compounds. This approach can one day be applied at the patient level, for example using patient-derived cancer cells. We have focused our proof of concept studies on the kinase family of drug targets, and hypothesize that our platform can identify kinase dependencies in cancer cells that cannot otherwise be identified using transcriptomic and whole exome sequencing data. The aims of this Phase I application are to 1) deploy our platform to identify novel kinase targets in DLBCL Lymphoma, and 2) identify kinase inhibitors that could be used to build a compound library that optimizes the performance of the platform. Innovative features of the platform include the combination of target- and phenotypic-based screening, the machine learning algorithm that efficiently detects targets as well as anti-targets, the cell-based screening strategy which uses both tumor and normal cells to detect cancer-specific cytotoxicity, and the unique design features of the compound library. The platform will enable rapid target identification in any area of disease where a clinically relevant cell-based model exists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, the cost of developing new drugs has skyrocketed. A major culprit is the difficulty in identifying cellular components that can be engaged by drugs to produce a therapeutic effect. This proposal has two main aims: 1) The first aim is to demonstrate that by using computer algorithms to combine biochemical- and cellular- screening data, effective drug targets can be identified for two different subtypes of DLBCL lymphoma. Importantly, the method also identifies off-targets that, if disturbed, will counteract the desired outcome (i.e. lower or neutralize a drug’s efficacy). The method uses normal blood cells from healthy donors to ensure that the identified drug targets serve to specifically abolish cancer cells without harming normal cells. These key features make our method a valuable complement for currently used target identification technologies, including genomics and proteomics. 2) The second aim is to develop the core components of the methodology into a robust and standalone platform that can be used by drug discovery programs at Truvitech, its partners, and its clients. !",Developing a novel platform for rapid identification of drug targets and anti-targets,9553172,R41TR002293,"['Adult Lymphoma', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Client', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Normal Cell', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Promega', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cellular targeting', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic manipulation', 'genomic platform', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lead optimization', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NCATS,"TRUVITECH, LLC",R41,2018,224804,0,0.0321151365346696
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9782089,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'microphysiology system', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ on a chip', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'testing services']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2018,240000,227946,0.054049233762116095
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,9593457,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,276802,81181560,0.04891705659237265
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,77336088,0.1036536888114449
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9563289,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2018,303474,232986943,0.02248812805891995
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9419924,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'lead optimization', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,312167,570146095,0.0896824647903172
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9504498,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'AIDS therapy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,336086,58406802,0.018759521252350874
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing.

"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9549093,R01GM081871,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,346545,113554200,0.0943871291197347
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9479284,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,374026,533594881,0.06030235433168574
"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Relevance to Public Health Biological sequences, including DNA, RNA and protein sequences, represent the largest sources of growing big data in current biology and medicine, which provide tremendous opportunities for precision medicine, synthetic biology, and other areas. Deep learning as an emerging machine-learning method has a great potential in utilizing these data in biomedical research.

"Data-driven analysis of protein structure, function, and regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Proteins are capable of performing a wide variety of complex molecular functions and play a central role in all biological processes.

"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9520213,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384167,91477866,0.06647454054357248
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,329565273,0.027888894552265862
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these developing emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for “data-driven” drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. A pioneering project and dataset for D4 is the Broad Institute’s Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. Though with many successes, the Connectivity Map is based on only a single biomolecule type, RNA, and downstream effects caused by chemical perturbations to proteins and metabolites are ignored. In this proposal, we combine the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolic network modeling and metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput compound screening platform. Our preliminary data for two major drugs (doxorubicin and rapamycin) showcases that our approach has technical validity, accuracy, and provides potential biological utility that complements transcriptomics based approaches. This Phase I proposal will assess the biological utility of a metabolomics-based screening platform. First, we will profile ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes. Second, we will develop the necessary bioinformatics pipelines, mechanistic metabolic models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret these complex datasets. Finally, we will assess whether adding metabolomics data to the Connectivity Map boosts D4 predictions including assessing compound mechanisms of actions, compound similarity, identifying biomarkers for drug efficacy and safety, and identifying drug repurposing opportunities. After the biological utility of this approach is demonstrated in Phase I, Phase II will focus on profiling of novel chemical and genetic perturbations to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating rare genetic diseases. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we will build a unique platform focused on the impact of human metabolism in disease.

"A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics The leading and trailing untranslated regions (UTRs) of an mRNA, along with the coding sequence (CDS), control protein production by modulating translation and mRNA stability. However, although we have identified a vast number of regulatory features in these regions, we are still far from being able to predict, for example, whether and how a sequence variant affects the levels of protein being made. Here, we propose to combine high-throughput experimental characterization of protein expression in synthetic libraries with machine learning to create predictive models of translation and mRNA stability, addressing an urgent need. Recent progress in machine vision, voice recognition and other fields of computer science has been driven by the availability of enormous data sets on which to train models. Machine learning approaches have also had remarkable impact in biology, but biological data sets often are comparatively small, limiting the quality of models that can be learned. For example, there are only around 20,000 genes in the human genome, a restrictively small set of examples for training a predictive model that captures the full extent of the genome’s “regulatory code.” In this proposal, we aim to overcome this data size limitation by training predictive models of protein expression on data from millions of synthetic constructs -- a data set several orders of magnitude larger than the number of genes in the genome. Specifically, we will create libraries of in vitro transcribed mRNA with targeted variation in the UTRs and CDS and will assay protein expression of each library member by performing high-throughput polysome profiling, ribosome profiling, and mRNA stability assays. We will then use neural network approaches to learn predictive models of the relationship between mRNA sequence and levels of protein production. We will apply our models to three applications of practical importance: first, we expect to uncover novel biology, for example identifying regulatory sequence elements and interactions between them. Second, we will validate our models through the de novo design and experimental testing of sequences that result in higher levels or protein production than any of the millions of randomly generated members of the original library or than the endogenous UTR sequences currently used in biotechnology. Such stable and highly translating mRNA constructs would be of particular value for the field or mRNA therapeutics. Third, we will predict the functional consequences of genetic variation in UTRs on protein production and we will validate these predictions experimentally. We are far from understanding which genetic variants compromise gene regulatory function in ways that may contribute to disease, making such a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of variants valuable. This research project aims to use machine learning to build predictive models of translation and mRNA stability. Models are trained on data obtained by measuring protein production for millions of synthetic RNA constructs. Models will then be applied for understanding the consequences of genetic variation in humans and for the design of mRNA therapeutics.",A predictive model of mRNA stability and translation for variant interpretation and mRNA therapeutics,9421497,R01HG009892,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', '5&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Code', 'Computational Technique', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Expression Library', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Polyribosomes', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thiouridine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer science', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'mRNA Stability', 'member', 'novel', 'polysome profiling', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'ribosome profiling', 'screening', 'stable cell line', 'synthetic construct', 'voice recognition']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,444578,533302350,0.029612551843016127
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,9420242,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,577782,91477866,0.03172443488622763
"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Project Summary The growing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) is visible by the growth in companies and increasing deals over the past year between pharma and smaller companies using machine learning to assist in drug discovery. The continuing steady growth of structure-activity data for diverse targets, diseases and molecular properties poses a considerable challenge as they are generally not readily accessible for machine learning: content resides in a mixture of public databases (with differing levels of curation), disparate files within research groups, non- curated literature publications. In Phase I, Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. developed a prototype of Assay Central software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. Public data was mixed with collaborator/customer-contributed data, using original software and applied chemistry judgment of an expert team. In Phase I we created error checking and correction software. We also built and validated Bayesian models with the datasets that were collected and cleaned. And, in addition, we developed new data visualization tools. The software environment that we created readily enables the user to compile structure-activity data for building computational models and can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators as needed. This software can in turn be used for scoring new molecules and visualizing the multiple outputs in various formats. We have enabled ~14 collaborative projects which have shared models on specific targets such as PyrG for Tuberculosis (identifying a lead compound), HIV reverse transcriptase, whole cell screening for Leishmaniasis as well as P450 and nuclear receptor models (e.g. estrogen receptor) relevant to toxicology. We have utilized Assay Central in our ongoing internal projects working on Ebola, HIV and tuberculosis small molecule drug discovery. In Phase II, we propose the following aims that will enable us to develop Assay Central into a production tool for enabling drug discovery collaborations which we will continue to focus on. In Phase 1 we performed a preliminary analysis of different machine learning algorithms with select drug discovery datasets. In Phase II we will now perform a thorough evaluation and selection of additional machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors as well as assessment of combination of algorithms (e.g. Bayesian and Deep Learning). We will implement disease/target definitions for machine learning models to facilitate drug discovery. We will enable molecule selection and automated design and optimization. The utility of having such a tool as Assay Central readily available will empower scientists to leverage public, private or a combination of data to help with their drug discovery tasks. Developing this software suite of computational models with public data will enable us to identify foundations, academics and potential collaborators that generate preliminary data to test models. These efforts will dramatically increase the number of projects we can work on, create new IP, and generate employment using machine learning focused on drug discovery in the area of rare and neglected diseases, in particular. Assay Central benefits include 1. Ease of deployment and use with a Java file executed by users without the need for IT support; 2. Built on industry standard technologies; 3. Graphical display of models provides instant feedback; 4 Model applicability with multiple methods to assess scores and graphics. Project Narrative In Phase I Collaborations Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed a prototype of ‘Assay Central’ software and used this with a wide variety of structure activity data from sources both public and private, formatted and unformatted, for enabling neglected, rare or common disease targets. The software environment that we created readily enables us to compile structure-activity data for building computational models, can be used to create selections of these models for sharing with collaborators and has been used successfully to find promising lead compounds for many collaborators. We now propose in Phase II to optimize the underlying machine learning algorithms and molecular descriptors (e.g. combining Bayesian and Deep Learning), linking potentially thousands of rare and neglected diseases to the machine learning models, and automating molecule selection and new molecule design to enable further high value drug discovery collaborations with Assay Central.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9619615,R44GM122196,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Client', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ebola virus', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Industry Standard', 'Intention', 'Java', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Licensing', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Support', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'exhaustion', 'forest', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'neglect', 'novel therapeutics', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'scale up', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trend']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R44,2018,694172,280601,0.050538768415239875
"Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to extend its innovative software platform — BioAssay Express (BAE, version 1.0) — which helps biologists to quickly and easily encode their plain-text biological assay protocols into formats suitable for computational processing. In Phase 2B, CDD will further enhance BAE so that it can markup a bioassay with a comprehensive, detailed set of annotations that completely specifies the protocol, step by step. In its current state of development in Phase 2, BAE 1.0 enables scientists to summarize the English language text that specifies an experimental protocol, supplementing it with machine-interpretable descriptors. At the end of Phase 2B, BAE 2.0 will output a detailed machine- interpretable version that will be completely equivalent to, and can optionally substitute for, the traditional English language method description. The enhanced BAE 2.0 software will enable scientists engaged in early stage drug discovery to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures and intelligently aggregate datasets across research groups. An important benefit will be facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility by (1) flagging differences between closely related assays; (2) correlating differences in protocols with differences in results; and (3) improving the reproducibility of experiments conducted in different laboratories, to highlight potential causes of divergences. The project will continue to leverage the related broad initiatives at NIH and elsewhere that are working to promote translational research, gather screening data via open repositories, and apply sophisticated ontologies to classify these datasets. Our project targets the intersection of these disparate initiatives and unifies them by making their complex standards and guidelines for praxis realistically accessible to researchers who want to focus on their scientific work To encourage adoption, the software will prioritize intuitive ease of use by scientists who are not informatics experts, harmonize with existing laboratory workflows, minimize the extra effort of annotation, integrate seamlessly into preclinical data management platforms (including but not limited to CDD’s own CDD Vault), and deliver clear and immediate benefits to the user as part of an integrated experience. This combination of new capabilities and extreme ease of use will accelerate translational drug discovery efforts by empowering software platforms that bridge the divide between biologists and medicinal chemists to apply sophisticated tools — long available on the chemistry side — for the first time also to the biological side, and thus across both domains. Existing software can already easily connect screening results to chemical structures. This new platform will further connect these data to the purpose and methodology of the screens. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accurately document experimental procedures, thereby facilitating improved access, use and reproducibility of data and assays. This fundamental capability ultimately accelerates translating new experimental discoveries into the development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. These tools will particularly benefit networks of researchers working on diseases that leading pharmaceutical companies have largely ignored because they are not perceived as highly profitable opportunities, despite the fact that in many cases they afflict millions of people.",Comprehensive but simple encoding of bioassays to accelerate translational drug discovery,9464228,R44TR000185,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'English Language', 'Ensure', 'Experimental Designs', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Incentives', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Screening Result', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'drug discovery', 'empowered', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2018,744321,1905060,0.035836116395305546
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9527891,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'human model', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'microphysiology system', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ on a chip', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'testing services']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2018,839860,227946,0.054049233762116095
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9392522,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2018,912707,10159852,0.06547256012881308
"Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The percent of Gram-negative bacterial infections that are resistant to common antibiotics has increased at an alarming rate over the last decade, and there is now an acute need for the discovery of novel antibiotics effective against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. The standard method of antibacterial discovery – whole- cell screening of compound collections – has met with repeated failure for Gram-negatives, and these failures have been traced to the fact that very few compounds in standard collections can penetrate the Gram-negative cell membranes and accumulate in these pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been scant information about the types of compounds that are competent for accumulation in Gram-negatives. Excitingly, we recently assessed a unique collection of >180 diverse compounds for their ability to accumulate in E. coli, trained a random forest classification model to analyze the results, and from this data we identified physicochemical properties important for accumulation and developed predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in E. coli. We then showed the utility of these guidelines by converting a Gram-positive-only antibiotic into a broad-spectrum agent. We now propose to develop tools that will allow us to fully define the physicochemical traits that enable compounds accumulation in three of the most concerning Gram-negative bacteria, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), drug-resistant Acinetobacter, and drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (to be referred to collectively as EAP pathogens). Specifically, we seek to develop novel tools in the area of chemical probes (compound collections), bacterial strains, and computational models. Using these tools in conjunction with our well-validated compound accumulation assay, we intend to define the physicochemical traits needed for compound accumulation in the EAP pathogens, including assessment of the influence of porins and efflux pumps, and the relative contribution of the outer and inner-membranes to blocking compound penetrance. Our predictive guidelines will be utilized to convert several high-value Gram-positive-only compounds into broad- spectrum antibiotics. PROJECT NARRATIVE It has been 50 years since the approval of a new class of drugs effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and as such, there are now limited treatment options for drug-resistant Gram-negative infections. This paucity of drugs can be directly traced to the lack of understanding about the types of compounds that can accumulate inside these bacteria. Herein we propose a comprehensive and systematic plan to develop predictive guidelines for compound accumulation in the most problematic drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pathogens, and to use this information to develop general strategies to convert Gram-positive-only compounds into broad-spectrum antibiotics.",Predictive Guidelines for Penetrance and Discovery of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics,9485464,R01AI136773,"['Acinetobacter', 'Acute', 'Amines', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Escherichia coli', 'Failure', 'Fusidic Acid', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Literature', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Penetrance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Publications', 'Resistance', 'Scientist', 'Training', 'VDAC1 gene', 'Variant', 'World Health Organization', 'carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'efflux pump', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'functional group', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,1436141,76545728,0.04682494677219052
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,185946435,-0.0036992488255507255
"Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning Project Summary/Abstract Allostery is action at a distance in proteins. It is a property by which perturbation at one site of a protein causes an effect at a distant site of the protein. As nature's biological switches allosteric proteins regulate virtually every major process including catalysis, transcription, transport and signaling. Kinases, G-protein coupled receptors and nuclear receptors are therapeutically important allosteric proteins that play a major role in human health. Disruption of allosteric communication caused by mutations in these proteins is strongly associated with many types of disease abnormalities including cancer. Since the discovery of allostery in the 1960s, the molecular mechanism by which perturbation at one end of a protein is allosterically transmitted to the other end remains a mystery. Understanding molecular “rules” governing allostery is a fundamental problem in protein biochemistry and biophysics. Such rules may provide a deep insight into how proteins work through interactions between residues. Current approaches to studying allostery, which are biophysical, structural or computational, have two limitations. First, they provide an incomplete picture. Allostery involves the interplay of protein dynamics, structural changes and their effects on function. Probing each independently, as most studies do, does not give a complete understanding. Structure alone cannot explain dynamics, dynamical movement does not imply functional role, and functional studies may not provide insight into the underlying molecular causes. Second, detailed mechanistic studies of individual allosteric proteins while invaluable, are tedious, and cannot be scaled up to investigate many types of allosteric proteins. As a result, unifying heuristic rules would be difficult to infer from such individual case studies. The goal of my research is to develop a generalized, scalable method integrating structure, function and dynamics to understand, quantify and predict molecular drivers of protein allostery. With allosteric transcription factors as a model system, we will determine residues important for allostery (`hotspots') and their connectivity (`pathway') by deep mutational scanning, a method for large-scale functional characterization. We establish a critical link between structure and function by computationally modeling each mutation with Rosetta. We use machine learning on this rich sequence-structure-function dataset to recognize common molecular features (van der Waals, electrostatics, hydrogen bonds etc.) of allosteric hotspot residues, to build a predictive molecular model of allostery. Thus, we integrate high-throughput functional studies, structure-based modeling and machine learning to understand molecular rules governing allostery. Any allosteric protein whose activity can be coupled to a high-throughput screen, of which there are many, is amenable to our approach. Over time as the number and diversity of allosteric protein datasets increases, we expect that the accuracy and generalizability of predictions will continuously improve. Our long-term objective is to be able to (a) predict functional impact of thousands of mutations in disease-associated allosteric proteins revealed by genome sequencing (b) discover novel allosteric sites that improve selectivity and efficacy of drugs. Project Narrative GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ion channels and kinases are allosteric proteins that alone account for 44% of all human protein drug targets. We propose to develop a broad experimental and computational platform to understand molecular mechanism of allostery. This study will pave the way to explaining how dysfunction in allosteric proteins manifests into disease, and developing `smart' (allosteric) drugs that restore normal function.",Understanding molecular rules governing protein allostery by deep mutational scanning,9562195,DP2GM132682,"['Allosteric Site', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Case Study', 'Catalysis', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Functional disorder', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'drug efficacy', 'genome sequencing', 'heuristics', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular modeling', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'scale up', 'transcription factor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,DP2,2018,2146877,338121506,0.08065419309051476
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary

have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media

validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations Summary The objective of ‘Assay Central’ is to compile a comprehensive collection of datasets for structure-activity data for a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties, in a form that is immediately ready for model building and other forms of analysis using cheminformatics methods. This is aided by the existence of many sources of curated open data, and one in particular, ChEMBL 1, 2 will be used as the nucleus in Phase I. This bioassay data collection is incredibly valuable, but not currently provided in a form that is ready-to-go for use by small research and development (R&D) organisations that do not have their own in-house cheminformatics teams. The effort required to preprocess, filter, merge, validate and normalize the structure and activity data requires a great deal of software expertise and medicinal chemistry domain knowledge, which are key skillsets that are rare and expensive to combine within the same team. Create a script to analyze the databases like ChEMBL, selected parts of PubChem and others 1, 2 and partition it into groups of compatible activity measurements against the same target. We will seed the dataset collection with a set of 1840 target-assay groups that have been recently extracted from the ChEMBL v20 database, as well as EPA Tox21 measurements 3, using methodology that we have already developed (similar to that described in 4). We will build error checking and correction software. We will apply best-of-breed methodology for checking and correcting structure-activity data 5 which errs on the side of caution for problems with non- obvious solutions, so that we can manually identify problems and either apply patches, or datasource-specific automated corrections. We will build and validate Bayesian models with the datasets collected and cleaned. For each of the target-activity groups, we will create a Bayesian model using ECFP6 or FCFP6 fingerprints, and this will be one of the primary outputs from the project. Models will be evaluated using internal and external testing with receiver operator characteristic (ROC > 0.75), the integral of the true-negative-rate – true-positive-rate curve as well as the enrichment,6 Kappa value and positive predicted value.7 We will develop new data visualization tools as a proof of concept in phase I. We have already begun to explore preliminary visualization methods using multiple models, but these have so far focused primarily on a handful of machine learning models selected from a very large list. New visualization techniques are required to summarize large matrices of data, e.g. a list of proposed structures vs. thousands of target models. In Phase II we will expand by upgrading to newer ChEMBL releases, selectively incorporating screening runs from other databases (such as PubChem 8), These tools will consist of software created explicitly for this project (particularly web-based interfaces), as well as enhanced functionality added to 3rd party tools that we influence (e.g. mobile apps) and open source projects that we have already contributed to (e.g. CDK for fingerprints and Bayesian modelling). We will widely publicise Assay Central at conferences and in papers. Being able to use transparent computational models simultaneously for visualizing activity trends for multiple targets (both diseases and ADMET) removes the burden of curation or purchasing and maintaining expensive software, and drastically simplifies the addition of new data. It also represents a new frontier of drug discovery as a world of small, agile distributed R&D organizations has access to valuable public datasets that can inform their research. Such computational models will assist in drug repurposing efforts internally and with our collaborators while likely identifying new compounds for a wide array of drug discovery projects. Narrative There are massive publically accessible databases that include a broad variety of disease targets and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicology (ADMET) properties that are not a form that is immediately ready for machine learning model building. The ‘Assay Central’ project will compile a comprehensive collection of these datasets (from PubChem and ChEMBL) for structure-activity data. This will enable the user to quickly and automatically use machine learning models for various targets and properties. The approach will also have high value for drug repurposing efforts and identifying new compounds for targets with creation of new IP in our own research on neglected and rare diseases and in the laboratories of customers.",Centralized assay datasets for modelling support of small drug discovery organizations,9254390,R43GM122196,"['Attention', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Excretory function', 'Fingerprint', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'absorption', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'drug discovery', 'frontier', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'neglect', 'open data', 'open source', 'research and development', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NIGMS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R43,2017,149999,280601,0.046771074598156506
"An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction PROJECT SUMMARY The process of drug discovery is costly and many promising compounds fail during clinical trials. By then, expenses upward of $500 million dollars per failed drug may have incurred and these financial risks hamper research efforts and – ultimately – reduce the availability of treatment options. In this research proposal we are using systematic approaches to map the relationships between drugs, genes, and phenotypes, i.e. the ability of a drug to elicit a certain molecular response in a cell with a specific gene mutation. These efforts aim at generating three important insights:  (1) By performing these mapping systematically across many drugs and many phenotypes we generate  phenotypic profiles that can aid in the classification of new compounds, enabling us to predict how well  these compounds may fare in later clinical stages, thus reducing cost and risk in drug development;  (2) By characterizing existing drugs more thoroughly, we can discover novel off-label usages for existing  drugs, thus expanding treatment options of FDA-approved compounds;  (3) By understanding gene-drug-phenotype relationships one-by-one we can assemble a complete picture  of drug-gene interactions, an important milestone in the development of personalized  pharmacogenomics that would allow patient-specific treatment planning. To accomplish these goals, we will employ a novel yeast-based phenotypic screening platform and use data- driven ontologies to understand the similarities between drugs in the phenotype-gene space. Overall, this work will move us closer to a comprehensive understanding of how phenotypes arise from the genome and how complex relationships between genes and drugs shape our medical treatment strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to develop a drug-screening platform and database that will allow improved prediction of a drug's side-effects, mode-of-action, cross-reactivity and other important pharmacological attributes in the context of gene mutations. This system would reduce drug discovery cost, encourage rare disease research, and ultimately lead to personalized pharmacogenomics – the ability to select drugs and therapies based on the genetic makeup of individual patients to optimize treatment results.","An integrative multi-phenotype pipeline for drug evaluation, pharmacogenomics, and attribute prediction",9256264,R41TR001908,"['Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Model', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Markers', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Modelings', 'Economics', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Microtubules', 'Mitochondria', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutate', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell growth', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic manipulation', 'genotoxicity', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stable cell line', 'stem', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NCATS,"PHENVOGEN, LLC",R41,2017,224991,0,0.03713939120797434
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,9325031,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,293344,511185245,0.0773736218923487
"Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization Project Summary  The proposed work will accelerate the pace of drug discovery by developing, validating, and testing new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug design. Two fundamental challenges of structure-based drug design are the accurate scoring and ranking of protein-ligand structures, which identiﬁes active com- pounds, and the ability to efﬁciently search a large number of ligands, which ensures that active compounds are sampled. This proposal will address these challenges by developing a novel approach for protein-ligand scoring and expanding the size of the chemical space that can be efﬁciently searched during lead optimiza- tion. The methods will be validated by their prospective application toward the discovery of new anti-cancer molecules and will be made readily accessible through online resources and open-source tools.  The proposal leverages recent and signiﬁcant advances in deep learning and image recognition to develop scoring functions that accurately recognize high-afﬁnity protein-ligand interactions. This is achieved by design- ing and training convolutional neural nets on three-dimensional representations of protein-ligand structures to discriminate between binders and non-binders. Convolutional neural net training will exploit large datasets of afﬁnity and structural data to automatically extract the relevant features necessary to accurately prioritize compounds. Additionally, the proposal develops the ﬁrst means of fully integrating a convolutional neural net scoring function directly into an energy minimization and docking workﬂow.  Interactive virtual screening enables the search of millions of compounds in a few seconds so that queries can be interactively optimized. Interactivity enables the synergistic uniﬁcation of human expert knowledge and efﬁcient computational algorithms. The proposed work will dramatically expand the size of chemical space ac- cessible through interactive virtual screening. Algorithms for efﬁciently searching the chemical space of billions or trillions of compounds implicitly deﬁned by a set of reaction schemas and fragments will be created as part of a lead optimization workﬂow. Fragment-oriented search will be accelerated by a new data structure that combines pharmacophore and molecular shape information into a single sub-linear time index.  The scoring and lead optimization methods developed in this proposal will be released as open-source soft- ware and made immediately available through open-access online resources. As part of the prospective valida- tion of the proposed methods, these resources will be used to identify hit compounds and optimize leads for two targets related to cancer metabolism: serine hydroxymethyltransferase and kidney glutaminase isoform C. Successful completion of the objectives of this proposal will positively impact public health by reducing the cost and time-to-market of developing new drugs, particularly with respect to novel protein targets. Project Narrative  Researchers will be able to more quickly and accurately identify potential drug candidates using the new methods, tools, and resources for structure-based drug discovery created by this project. These tools will be readily accessible through open-access web sites and open-source software. As part of the project these tools will be used to identify new molecules that are relevant to the treatment of cancer.","Methods, Tools and Resources for Interactive Online Virtual Screening and Lead Optimization",9235506,R01GM108340,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Glutaminase', 'Glutamine', 'Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RANK protein', 'Reaction', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'cheminformatics', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'molecular shape', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'overexpression', 'pharmacophore', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'resource guides', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor xenograft', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web interface', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,309750,570146095,0.0896824647903172
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9357736,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filoviridae', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred BALB C Mice', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Products', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'clinical candidate', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'intraperitoneal', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2017,312390,280601,0.023930689103120958
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms.

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9356560,R01GM120364,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2017,343120,58406802,0.018759521252350874
"Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design Abstract Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), whole genome sequencing, and high-throughput techniques have generated vast amounts of diverse omics and phenotypic data. However, these sets of data have not yet been fully explored to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery, which continues along the one- drug-one-gene paradigm. Consequently, the cost of bringing a drug to market is staggering, and the failure rate is daunting. Our long-term goal is to revive the lagging pharmaceutical pipeline by identifying robust methods for achieving precision medicine. We will achieve this goal by developing a novel structural systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery, which integrates structure-based drug design with heterogeneous omics data integration and analysis in the context of the whole human and pathogen genome and interactome. An increasing body of evidence from both our group and others suggests that most drugs commonly interact with multiple receptors (targets). Both strong and weak multiple drug-target interactions can collectively mediate drug efficacy, toxicity, and resistance through the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. In order to rationally design potent, safe, and precision medicine, we face one of the major unsolved challenges in structure-based drug design: what are all the possible proteins and their conformational states interacting with a drug in an organism? This proposal attempts to address this challenge by developing, disseminating, and experimentally testing novel computational tools. Based on our successful preliminary results, we will develop an integrated computational pipeline to identify three-dimensional (3D) protein-chemical interaction models in the cellular context and on a structural proteome scale. Specifically, we will develop a quaternary structure- centric multi-layered network model by integrating heterogeneous data from genomics, proteomics, and phenomics. We will develop a novel collaborative one-class collaborative filtering algorithm to infer missing relations in the multi-layered network. We will combine tools derived from structural bioinformatics, biophysics, and machine learning to gain biological insights into the drug action. To facilitate the usability and reproducibility of the proposed algorithms, we will develop community-based web resources established by our previous experiences in developing the Protein Data Bank (PDB). More importantly, we will work closely with experimental laboratories to test the proposed computational tools using targeted kinase polypharmacology as a real-world example, and iteratively improve the performance and usability of algorithm, software, and web services. The successful completion of this project will provide the scientific community with: (1) new methods to enhance the scope and capability of high-throughput screening for structure-based multi-target drug design; (2) a user-friendly web service to support community-based drug discovery; and (3) potential novel anti-cancer targeted therapeutics. Together, these tools will advance drug discovery and precision medicine by providing a structural systems pharmacology toolkit. Relevance Statement The pharmaceutical industry is in a dire state. Both the cost to launch a new drug and the attrition rate are increasing. Methods that can correlate drug-target interactions with clinical outcomes will reduce both the cost of drug development and mortality rates during clinical trials and treatments.",Omics data integration and analysis for structure-based multi-target drug design,9285997,R01GM122845,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Docking', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Effectiveness', 'Extracellular Protein', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data integration', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'online resource', 'open source', 'pathogen genome', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'small molecule', 'structural genomics', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2017,354226,17295825,0.0977001954792106
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9247825,R44HL126314,"['Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2017,369580,3620090,0.030399486272129406
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9265938,R01LM012222,"['Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'clinical development', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'experimental study', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,374026,533594881,0.06030235433168574
"Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. On average, a protein interacts with ~5 other protein partners in the current human interactome. Therefore, it is of great importance to accurately determine the interface of each interaction, in order to understand how each protein works with different partners to carry out different functions. In our previous Nature Biotechnology study, we implemented a proteome-scale homology modeling approach to generate the first 3D human structural interactome: the interface for each interaction in this network was determined at atomic resolution through co-crystal structures and homology models. Using our 3D interactome, we found that, among >1,800 known disease genes associated with two or more clinically distinctly disorders, pairs of mutations on the same gene but in different interfaces with different partners are significantly more likely to cause distinct diseases. However, only 4,150 human protein interactions have co-crystal structures and 2,921 have high-quality homology models. ~50,000 interactions (87% of the current human interactome) are not amenable to current structural modeling methods. Here, we propose to develop a big-data-driven machine-learning approach integrating biophysiochemical, evolutionary, structural, and population genetic features to identify interaction- specific interfaces for the whole human interactome. Because several key features are unavailable for many proteins and interactions, we propose an innovative approach to use an ensemble of random forest classifiers, named Ensemble Protein Interface Classifier (EPIC), to address this large-scale non-random missing data problem (Aim 1). The high throughput of our massively parallel Clone-seq and INtegrated PrOtein INteractome perTurbation screening (InPOINT) pipeline! uniquely enables us to perform real-time experimental parameter optimization (in Years 2-4 we will clone ~1,500 mutations and examine their impact on ~2,500 interactions every year to iteratively evaluate and refine EPIC; Aim 2). Finally, we will construct a comprehensive multiscale 3D interactome for all known human protein-protein interactions: we will collect/generate atomic- resolution structural models for interactions whenever possible (co-crystal structures and homology models); we will accurately determine interaction-specific interface residues and domains for the whole human interactome. We will deploy an interactive web portal to disseminate our results and allow functional genomic inference in the context of our structural interactome (Aim 3). Our comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome and the accompanying web portal will greatly reduce the barrier-to-entry for performing systematic structural analysis on a large number of proteins and their interactions, and open the flood gates for such analyses in genomic studies. NARRATIVE Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins and the structural details of these interaction interfaces are key in understanding protein function. However, the interfaces for vast majority of human protein interactions are currently unknown. Here, we propose to establish an innovative ensemble classifier approach and implement an unprecedented large-scale computational-experimental iterative learning scheme to predict interfaces for the whole human interactome, in anticipation that our predicted interfaces will help dissect functional sites of disease mutations and be useful for rational drug design to target these sites.",Towards a comprehensive multiscale 3D human interactome network,9375803,R01GM124559,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution', 'Floods', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Population Genetics', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'forest', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'user-friendly', 'web portal', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,379776,91477866,0.06647454054357248

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,329565273,0.027888894552265862
"Structure based Prediction of the interactome The interactions of small molecules with proteins is not only omnipresent throughout cellular processes, but also of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment. Much like with protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, high-throughput (HTP) experimental methods have led to the generation of enormous volumes of protein-small molecule and related data. However, in addition to sheer scale, high degrees of heterogeneity in these data, combined with proprietary ownership concerns when originating from within industry, present significant challenges to the sharing and full use of this data in basic research and therapeutic development. This proposal aims to develop new mathematical methods that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning of structural features can reduce the dependence of researchers on prior assumptions as to important predictors of drug-target interactions (DTI).  In our previous granting period, we successfully developed methods for structure-based prediction and HTP data analysis of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions, uncovering novel biology (e.g., for neurodegenerative diseases). In this renewal, we aim to: 1) develop scalable methods for multi-party computation and differential privacy to enable the secure sharing of large proprietary drug-target interaction databases among industry and public researchers; 2) develop novel integrative machine learning approaches for identifying drug-target interactions based on interactome, molecular structure and chemogenomic data (in collaboration with co-I Jian Peng); and 3) establish innovative collaborations with industry, academia and the scientific community to drive use and adoption of these computational tools and technologies among practicing biomedical researchers.  Successful completion of these aims will provide both public and private research communities with scalable access to technologies for secure sharing of proprietary drug screening data as well as flexible, accurate tools for predicting drug-target interactions. All developed software will be made available via publicly accessible web-based portals under open source software licenses. Collaborations with research partners will validate the relevance of these tools to human health and disease, while the dissemination aim will ensure research communities convenient and ongoing access to these innovations. Narrative The interactions of small molecules with proteins are omnipresent throughout cellular processes and of fundamental importance to drug design and disease treatment, yet the task of predicting these interactions brings major challenges because of the heterogeneity and proprietary nature of the data. In this proposal, we develop new mathematical methods and software that can address not only interpreting the data itself, but also the collaborative and generative process through which researchers work: new cryptographic tools can enable unprecedented forms of secure sharing and collaboration between industry and the public, and deep learning can accelerate the drug discovery process.",Structure based Prediction of the interactome,9384431,R01GM081871,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affinity', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Fright', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Ownership', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'cryptography', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research and development', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,422166,113554200,0.0943871291197347
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections. Validating the molecular targets of these compounds for in vivo nerve growth will enable future drug discovery projects focused on these targets.",Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury,9401793,R01NS100531,"['Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Complement 5a', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Control Animal', 'Contusions', 'Corticospinal Tracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Dorsal', 'Dose', 'Failure', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Injectable', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery of Function', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal cord injury patients', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Viral Vector', 'Walking', 'axon growth', 'axon regeneration', 'behavior test', 'behavioral outcome', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injured', 'insight', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'light microscopy', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,474406,157845771,0.028207722059567748
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9357870,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Hybridization', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2017,720717,46216755,0.020044013573586924
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9220609,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2017,871572,10159852,0.06547256012881308
"Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing PROJECT SUMMARY The drug development pipeline is plagued by unacceptable rates of attrition due in large part to toxicities that are not identified in pre-clinical stages of development. The ability to de-risk lead compounds during pre-clinical development with advanced “organoid-on-a-chip” technologies shows tremendous promise. Drug-induced neurotoxicity is caused by off-target effects of pharmaceuticals that lead to sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. While rarely fatal, drug-induced neurotoxicity can lead to permanent nerve damage and in some cases can be a dose-limiting side effect, leading patients to reduce dosage or stop treatment altogether. Although the peripheral nervous system bears the brunt of this neurological toxicity, development of microphysiological models of the peripheral nervous system is lagging. Towards that end, the technology described herein allows for 3D growth of high density axonal fiber tracts, resembling peripheral nerve anatomy. Progress during the prior award phase strongly demonstrated the feasibility of using microengineered neural tissues that are amenable to morphological and physiological measurements analogous to those of clinical tests. The use of structural and functional analyses should mean drug-induced neural toxicity will manifest in these measurements in ways that mimic clinical neuropathology. The goals of this proposal are to establish our human model using relevant physiological measurements in tissues fabricated from human iPS cells, and to validate the model system with a library of compounds, comparing against conventional cell culture models. Validating the peripheral nerve model system with drugs known to induce toxicity via a range of mechanisms will demonstrate the ability of the system to predict various classifications of neuropathy, yielding a high-content assay far more informative than traditional in vitro systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current methods available for bringing drugs to market have resulted in high attrition rates as compounds progress through the drug pipeline, resulting in unacceptable clinical trial toxicity and skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices. Improving the predictive power of preclinical models represents the fastest and most competitive method to advance the safety and time to market for new therapeutics. As an added benefit, decreased drug development costs should also expand the availability of novel treatment options for patients.",Peripheral Nerve-on-a-chip for Predictive Preclinical Pharmaceutical Testing,9410154,R42TR001270,"['Action Potentials', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neural Conduction', 'Neurites', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organ', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preparation', 'Price', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Speed', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'axon growth', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'density', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'expectation', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'motor deficit', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response']",NCATS,"AXOSIM, INC.",R42,2017,963541,227946,0.054049233762116095
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary

have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media

"Development of integrative models for early liver toxicity assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computational toxicology has become a critical area of research due to the burgeoning need to evaluate thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals with unknown toxicity profiles, the high demand in time and resources by current experimental toxicity testing, and the growing ethical concerns over animal use in toxicity studies. Despite tremendous efforts, little success has been attained thus far in the development of predictive computational models for toxicity, primarily due to the complexity of toxicity mechanisms as well as the lack of high-quality experimental data for model development.  A critical challenge in toxicity testing of chemicals is that toxicity effects are doe-dependent: the true toxic hits may show no toxicity at all at low dose level. Therefore, traditiona high-throughput screening (HTS) that test chemicals only at a single concentration is not suitable for toxicity screening. On the contrary, the recently developed quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) platforms can evaluate each chemical across a broad range of concentrations, and is gaining ever-increasing popularity as a tool for in vitro toxicity profiling The concentration-response information generated by qHTS are expected to provide more accurate and comprehensive information of the toxicity effects of chemicals, offering promising data that can be mined to estimate in vivo toxicities of chemicals. However, our previous studies showed that if processed inappropriately, such concentration-response information contribute little to improve the toxicity prediction. This is especially true when multiple types of qHTS data are used together. Therefore, in this study, we will extend our previous approaches to develop novel statistical and computational tools that can curate, preprocess, and normalize the concentration-response information from multiple different qHTS databases.  Traditionally, toxicity models are based on either the chemical data (such as the quantitative structure- activity relationship analysis), or the in vitro toxicity profiling data (such as the in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). Our previous experiences suggested that integrating biological descriptors such as the in vitro cytotoxicity profiles or the short-term toxigenomic data, with chemical structural features is able to predict rodent acute liver toxicity with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, the second part of this proposal will be devoted to develop novel computational models for hepatotoxicity prediction by integrating qHTS toxicity profiles and chemical structural information In Aim 1, we will curate, preprocess, and normalize collected public liver toxicity datasets. In ths study, we will model toxicity effects using multiple large public datasets such as HTS and qHTS bioassay data (Tox21[1] and ToxCast[2]), hepatotoxicity side effect reports on marketed failed drugs[3], the Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base Benchmark Dataset (LTKB-BD[4]), etc. Statistical methods for cross-study validation and quality control will be applied to the collected datasets to ensure computational compatibility and to select the appropriate datasets for analysis. In Aim 2, we will develop predictive models for chemicals' liver toxicity based on an integrative modeling workflow that will make use of both structural and in vitro toxicity profiles of a chemical. Our previous studies [5] showed that models using both in vitro toxicity profiles and chemical structural data have better accuracy for rodent acute liver toxicity than models using either data type alone. Here, we will develop a novel modeling workflow that start with defining the functional clusters of chemicals via curated qHTS toxicity profiles, and is followed by developing computational models to correlate chemical and biological data with overall toxicity risks in humans. The predictive models will be validated using independent datasets with over 800 compounds. In Aim 3, we propose to prioritize the qHTS profiling assays used in the model for future toxicity testing. We will evaluate all the in vitro assays as biological descriptors from thee perspectives, including descriptor importance in the integrative toxicity model, correlation with i vivo DILI outcomes, and level of information content estimated by a novel approach based on network analysis.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this study we aim to develop computational models that can identify potential liver toxicants. Liver toxicity is a significant contributor to the high attition rate in drug development. Moreover, toxic chemicals in food, water, and consumer products all pose serious risks for liver toxicity. As a result, there is great interest in developing high-throughput, high-content experimental and computational tools to evaluate the liver toxicity of thousands of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals. This study focuses on developing novel informatics tools that enable the extraction and integration of chemical concentration-response information from multiple quantitative high-throughput screening databases for model development, and developing statistical models that are able to integrate this concentration-response information with chemical structural features to predict their risk of liver toxicity.

"Optimization of small molecule triazine antituberculars for in vivo efficacy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is due to infection with the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This disease represents a global health pandemic as based on WHO statistics it claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year, while infecting nearly 9 million. New drugs are urgently needed with novel mechanisms of action that treat this disease while also addressing an important need to reduce the lengthy course of treatment that is at best 6 months in duration. We have a primary goal of discovering novel classes of antibacterials. (E)-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)-N2,N4-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2019) [1], was rediscovered by us using Bayesian machine learning models in 2013. It represents a class of antitubercular agents reported only once in 1969 [2]. While JSF-2019 did not exhibit in vivo efficacy in an acute model in our hands, a close analog, ((E)-N2,N4-diisopropyl-6-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine (JSF-2032) [2] was reported in 1969 to exhibit in vivo activity. Our preliminary data on solubility in PBS, mouse liver microsomal stability, Caco-2 cell permeability, and mouse snapshot pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles demonstrate that the diaminotriazine class of antituberculars holds significant promise for seeding a novel therapeutic. We aim to further improve upon the in vitro efficacy, in vitro Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of these early compounds. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: Utilize medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models to optimize the initial triazine hit family as antitubercular agents. Apply transcriptional profiling nd resistant mutant/whole-genome sequencing methods to identify potential drug targets and mechanism of action of the triazine antitubercular class. Phase I would, therefore, seek to deliver an in vivo active small molecule triazine with information as to potential target/s through complimentary methods. A Phase II program would leverage this information to further optimize this series towards a preclinical candidate of significant interest to foundations and/or biotech/pharmaceutical companies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis represents a global health pandemic, which claims the lives of approximately 1.5 million people per year. Starting from a series of triazines active compounds we will optimize ADME properties to afford a novel in vivo active lead compound by combining our unique expertise in medicinal chemistry and predictive ADME models. We will also probe the potential target/s of the triazine series.

"Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like liver X receptor (LXR) β selective agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent work demonstrated that activation of the LXR signaling pathways leads to improved amyloid β (Aβ) turnover, reduction in Aβ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic LXRβ selective binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects such as mutagenicity or binding to undesired targets. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biological assays to assess toxicity, brain penetration potential and the ability to induce expression of the corresponding genes. A dozen diverse compounds will have been tested through two iterations of the two steps of in silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. These initial leads will be augmented with additional de novo compounds and further scrutinized via behavioral assays, dose-response studies and more detailed, sophisticated, and mechanistic assays during Phase 2. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biological assays will identify drug-like LXRβ selective agonists with minimal side-effects. These agonists will slow and reverse Alzheimer’s Disease.",Discovery of LXR Agonists via Pharmacophore Space Mining,9202941,R43AG054350,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Joints', 'LXRalpha protein', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Liver X Receptor', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'PPAR gamma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'lipid metabolism', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacophore', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'social']",NIA,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2016,223325,0,-0.036151002374500064
"Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population. Narrative Preliminary clinical data showed that Ebola virus (EBOV) patients treated with the antimalarials artesunate- amodiaquine had a higher survival rate than those treated with artemether-lumefantrine, in agreement with the in vitro EC50 for amodiaquine EC50 of 2.6µM. The antimalarial pyronaridine, a structural analog of amodiaquine, was identified by a computational repurposing strategy and further shown to have an EC50 of 420 nM against EBOV in vitro. We now propose to fully characterize this compound using standard preclinical ADME assays prior to mouse pharmacokinetic analysis, determine broad-spectrum applicability against multiple EBOV strains and ultimately in vivo efficacy testing in the mouse Ebola virus model prior to testing in a non-human primate model. Our aim is to show whether Pyronaridine is a viable clinical candidate to treat patients infected with EBOV.",Repurposing pyronaridine as a treatment for the Ebola virus,9204673,R21TR001718,"['Africa', 'Agreement', 'Amodiaquine', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antimalarials', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Babesia', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine resistance', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clomiphene', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Ebola virus', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'European', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Female', 'Filovirus', 'Formulation', 'Growth', 'Half-Life', 'Hour', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Libraries', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Mannich Bases', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Natural Product Drug', 'New England', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium vivax', 'Property', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Research Institute', 'Route', 'Solubility', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Toremifene', 'Toxic effect', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'Vivax Malaria', 'Whole Blood', 'analog', 'artemether', 'artesunate', 'base', 'benflumetol', 'bioactive natural products', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'high throughput screening', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neurotoxicity', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'pharmacophore', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'pyronaridine', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'treatment duration']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIONS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.",R21,2016,288801,280601,0.023930689103120958
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8972013,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,292404,558628098,0.09022386076381134
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.        ",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,8858750,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Planning Techniques', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,293344,511185245,0.0773736218923487
"DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are dangerous and expensive, afflicting about 1.5% of hospitalized patients with profound health and financial consequences. In Medicare patients alone, adverse drug reactions account for 19% of total spending ($339 billion), more than 1,900 deaths, and more than 77,000 extra hospital days per year. Idiosyncratic ADRs, especially rare and severe hypersensitivity-driven ADRs, are the leading cause of medicine withdrawal and termination of clinical development. At the same time, a large proportion of drugs are not associated with hypersensitivity driven ADRs, offering hope that new medicines could avoid them entirely with reliable predictors of risk. Hypersensitivity driven ADRs are caused by the formation of chemically reactive metabolites by metabolic enzymes. These reactive metabolites covalently attach to proteins to become immunogenic and provoke an ADR. Unfortunately, current computational and experimental approaches do not reliably identify drug candidates that form reactive metabolites. These approaches are limited because they inadequately model metabolism, which can both render toxic molecules safe and safe molecules toxic. To overcome this limitation, the proposed study aims to curate a public database of metabolism and reactivity and use this database to build accurate and validated mathematical models of metabolism and reactivity. The models will be constructed using machine-learning algorithms that quantitatively summarize the knowledge from thousands of published studies. The Aims are to (1) curate a database of metabolism and build models that identify rules governing the structure of reaction products during drug metabolism in the liver, (2) curate a database of reactivity and build improved reactivity models that mechanistically predict which metabolites are reactive with biological molecules, and (3) curate a database of reactive metabolites and combine these models to predict when molecules form reactive metabolites that covalently bind proteins. The computational models generated by these Aims will be validated through statistical approaches and against bench-top experiments. Taken together, this approach will substantially improve on existing approaches by more accurately modeling the properties determining whether metabolism renders drugs toxic or safe. The predictive models will make new medicines safer by helping researchers avoid molecules prone to ADRs without harming patients.         PROJECT NARRATIVE Adverse drug reactions, especially rare but severe hypersensitivity-driven reactions, have profound financial and health implications and are caused by reactive drug metabolites. As an extension of tools and data developed by our groups, we will build and test mathematical models and datasets that more accurately predict when molecules form clinically important reactive metabolites than current methodologies, such as “structural alerts.” We will use these models to build a tool that will better predict when drug candidates form reactive metabolites, which will make new medicines safer by enabling researchers to avoid drug candidates prone to causing adverse reactions.",DATA AND TOOLS FOR MODELING METABOLISM AND REACTIVITY,9006922,R01LM012222,"['Accounting', 'Adverse reactions', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Relative Risks', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Stevens-Johnson Syndrome', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'Withdrawal', 'adduct', 'data modeling', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug metabolism', 'drug withdrawal', 'gene function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'liver metabolism', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical model', 'model building', 'novel', 'online repository', 'predictive modeling', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'repository', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,351101,533594881,0.06030235433168574

"Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer ABSTRACT  Next generation genome scale sequencing of patients is now becoming routine for two classes of disease: rare  Mendelian traits and cancer. In favorable cases, these data allow identification of relevant mutations and thus  aid diagnosis and therapy. In both classes of disease, the most common type of mutation is missense -­ single  base  changes  that  result  in  an  amino  acid  substitution  in  a  protein.  Uncertainty  as  to  the  impact  of  these  mutations on in vivo protein activity has resulted in a very conservative approach to their interpretation in the  clinic,  so  causing  many  missed  opportunities  for  targeted  treatment.  The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  use  a  combination of three strategies to make the interpretation of these mutations much more applicable in the clinic.  There are already a large number of computational methods that attempt to determine the impact of missense  mutations on function, and there is substantial evidence that these have useful accuracy. The primary difficulty  is that the accuracy in any particular case is not reliably calibrated. Therefore, our first aim is to use a combination  of these methods to develop an approach focused on more reliable estimates for the probability of high impact  on  protein  function  (i.e.  more  confident  P  values).  The  second  aim  is  to  maximize  the  utilization  of  three-­ dimensional structural information, largely ignored by most computational methods. A large fraction of missense  mutations in these classes of disease act by destabilizing protein structure and knowledge of structure allows  these to be identified with much higher reliability. Also, structure provides a framework for detailed annotation  and comprehension of function. To facilitate the utilization of structure, we will implement a modeling platform  that leverages available experimental information to maximize the structural data available for analyzing mutation  impact.  An  important  aspect  of  the  platform  is  incorporation  of  methods  for  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  structural features relevant to analysis of each mutation. In the third aim we will build specific functional models  for each protein of interest, integrating information from current databases, the literature, and community input,  so as to provide the richest possible background against which to judge the impact of mutations. Proteopedia, a  well established media wiki for proteins, will be used to provide an integrated view of text, data, and structure. A  key component of the information resource will be contributions from curators, who will provide annotation and  also solicit input from other experts. This aspect of the project builds on experience with other crowdsourcing  endeavors,  including  CASP,  CAGI  and  Proteopedia.    There  will  be  three  primary  outcomes  from  the  project:  First, improved reliability for the interpretation of missense mutations. Second, a prototype mutation annotation  procedure suitable for use in a clinical setting. Third, the resource will provide information of benefit to a range  of other scientists, thus facilitating the analysis of disease related mutations.      NARRATIVE  Genome  scale  DNA  sequencing  is  now  contributing  to  diagnosis  and  therapy  in  cases  of  rare  human  disease and cancer.  Full exploitation of these data is currently hampered by inadequate understanding  of which DNA changes affect protein function so as to contribute to disease. This project aims to develop  the methods and tools needed to remove that obstacle. ",Molecular impact of mutations in monogenic disease and cancer,9156099,R01GM120364,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'crowdsourcing', 'data structure', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'next generation', 'primary outcome', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'wiki']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,372928,58406802,0.018759521252350874
"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,9059049,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate marker', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2016,423583,19252132,0.010184292720172891
"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,8917490,0.005343350212925778
"High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxicity accounts for approximately 20% of drug attrition, of which nearly one third is attributed to cardiovascular issues, in particular arrhythmias.1 The cost of bringing a new drug to market can exceed $1.2 billion and require more than 10 years of research. Thus, it is critical to identify cardiotoxicity early in developmen. Current in vitro screening assays for pro-­‐arrhythmic drug effects focus on measuring inhibition of the hERG potassium channel, which has been linked to potentially lethal Torsades de Pointes arrhythmias (TdP).2 The hERG assay, however, lacks high sensitivity and specificity: not all QT prolongation is due to block of hERG alone and not all hERG blockers result in QT prolongation or induce TdP. To address these limitations, regulatory bodies have created the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative2, which proposes use of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells as an in vitro model for arrhythmogenic drug potential. Establishment of this model for toxicity screening requires detailed characterization of the cardiomyocyte action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CT), the response of APs/CTs to drugs, and the correlation to clinical outcomes in humans. High-­‐throughput tools needed for performing these measurements, however, have been lacking. Here we propose to develop a high-­‐throughput, all-­‐optical electrophysiology platform for cardiotoxicity screening in sem cell-­‐derived cardiomyocytes. With our Phase I award, we demonstrated that the Optopatch platform could be used to detect changes in the electrophysiological characteristics of human derived CMs following both acute and chronic drug treatment, albeit with the throughput of a single well per recording. To highly parallelize these measurements, we propose building a 96-­‐well plate Optopatch instrument for simultaneous recording of voltage and calcium waveforms under paced conditions from 24 wells. This geometry will provide nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in throughput of our assay. Optopatch constructs will be optimized to allow for incorporation of the actuator and reporter proteins in each cell. We will utilize this platform to screen 50 compounds with known risk scores for Torsades de Pointes in different sources of human cardiomyocytes and use this data to develop a predictive algorithm of arrhythmogenicity.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Q­‐State's technology will allow better prediction of a drug candidate's potential adverse effects to the human heart than the assays mandated by the current cardiac safety guidance ICH S7B.   It will contribute to bringing effective healthcare solutions to market at lower cost and higher productivity, by preventing drugs with cardiotoxicity from reaching the market and preventing the development of valuable therapeutics from being wrongly terminated, which is one of the concerns about the current S7B assays. Making Q-­‐State instrumentation and reagents available to the academic research community will facilitate better mechanistic studies and therapeutics development to benefit patients with cardiac conditions.               ","High-throughput, all-optical assay in human cardiomyoctes for clinically relevant prediction of drug induced cardiotoxity.",9138354,R44HL126314,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Blinded', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Health', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Phototoxicity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potassium Channel', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Reagent', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Toxic effect', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'human stem cells', 'in vitro Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'phase 1 study', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"Q-STATE BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R44,2016,602645,3620090,0.030399486272129406
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally.

"HLS13-04 High-Content High-Throughput Screen for Diamond Blackfan Anemia Treatments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are thousands of rare genetic diseases that have no approved treatment. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has developed a drug discovery platform that seeks to re-purpose known drugs for the treatment of such diseases. The platform consists of high content immunofluorescent image analysis using machine-learning algorithms to identify relevant and on-target changes induced by both RNAi and various chemicals. This system has been used to identify a phenotype for loss of function of two related genes, RPS19 and RPS10 in multiple human cell types. Mutations in these genes are the primary cause of Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a rare genetic disease with no specific targeted therapy. In this grant, we propose to: develop RPS19 and RPS10 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology; evaluate knockout cell lines for phenotypes ('phenoprints') using our drug discovery platform; conduct chemical suppressor screens of thousands of known drug candidates to identify those that  ameliorate on-target phenoprints associated with loss of RPS19 and RPS10; expand the capabilities of our drug screening platform to enable the use of non-adherent cell lines in  our workflow and use the expanded capabilities to confirm the validity of drugs identifie as candidate therapies in  CD34+ suspended cell culture models of Diamond Blackfan Anemia. Recursion Pharmaceuticals has the experience, tools, and drive to execute this Phase I SBIR proposal, and to accelerate commercial development of any compounds arising from the project. The proposed study would have significant societal and commercial implications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a rare genetic disease for which no targeted therapy exists. Loss of function in RPS19 and RPS10, or other ribosomal protein genes, results in the disease.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8773597,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,291815,558628098,0.09022386076381134
"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate models of biological plausibility, based on knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature and using methods of hyperdimensional computing for efficient search and inference across multiple concepts and relations simultaneously. These methods will be used to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs found in structured clinical data, and extracted from unstructured data using natural language extraction. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively, for their ability to rediscover known side effects from the biomedical literature, and summatively for their ability to improve the precision of effects attributed to a st of known drugs using statistical methods alone. In addition we will evaluate their ability to predict recent FDA warnings, using historical data and knowledge. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify automatically plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to interpret clinical data. Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate methods to identify automatically biologically plausible adverse drug events found within clinical patient records, using knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature. If successful, these methods will provide the means for earlier detection of harmful drug effects, limiting consequent morbidity and mortality.",Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance,8909187,R01LM011563,"['Accounting', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Antibiotics', 'Azithromycin', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Output', 'Package Insert', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Rofecoxib', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'post-market', 'statistics', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,293778,135644722,0.03504632415039211
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8847691,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'built environment', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2015,421696,19252132,0.010184292720172891
"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.

We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8934076,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2015,915977,8428162,0.04648082147872187
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease. Pathogens of focus include  all human herpes viruses (HHVs), which infect billions worldwide every year, with a significant mortality rate in  immunocompromised patients; yet limited therapeutics exist for many of these viruses and virus populations  are becoming resistant to current drugs.

"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate models of biological plausibility, based on knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature and using methods of hyperdimensional computing for efficient search and inference across multiple concepts and relations simultaneously. These methods will be used to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs found in structured clinical data, and extracted from unstructured data using natural language extraction. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively, for their ability to rediscover known side effects from the biomedical literature, and summatively for their ability to improve the precision of effects attributed to a st of known drugs using statistical methods alone. In addition we will evaluate their ability to predict recent FDA warnings, using historical data and knowledge. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify automatically plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to interpret clinical data.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.           Project Narrative  Some drugs that are approved for sale to the public may have dangerous unknown side-effects. It is important to detect these unknown side effects as soon as possible in order to prevent serious illness or death.

"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8588329,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,291243,558628098,0.09022386076381134

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8633467,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2014,316023,61050884,0.06301264739428694
"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The results have the potential to the transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases, and to generate novel therapeutic opportunities.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In 2013 over 1.6 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed and over 580,000 people are expected to die of the disease. Thus, continued research in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of cancer is necessary. Although cancer is widely recognized as a genomic disease, the directives of the DNA-based drivers are executed at the level of proteins and their biological functions, and the application of potential protein level biomarkers remains a compelling vision. Thus, a large investment has been made by NCI and other research centers in high-throughput global proteomics experiments to mine for novel biomarkers of cancer. However, few of these markers have come to fruition. We believe that one of the major challenges to the discovery of robust protein- or pathway-biomarker candidates from these large and complex proteomics datasets is due to naive data analysis approaches that do not take into account the underlying complexity of the proteome (e.g., splice variants, post- translational modifications). State-of-the-art statistical algorithms to improve the tasks of quality assessment, peptide and protein quantification, and pathway modeling that are designed to account for the design of the experiment have been developed; however access to these methodologies by the larger community is hindered since they are in the prototype stage and typically require knowledge of statistical programming. Furthermore, the likelihood of these tools moving to robust software is low since they are developed within the context of existing grants that do not support the transition from prototype to software. For the field of clinical proteomics to successfully identif new mechanistic etiologies of cancer requires not only high quality data with respect to the instrument, but also high quality statistical analysis of the data. This project proposes new informatics technology in the form of a robust, interactive and cross- platform software environment that will enable biomedical and biological scientists to perform in-depth analyses of global proteomics data from the point of quality assessment and normalization of raw inferred abundances (e.g., peak area) to the identification of protein biomarkers and enriched pathways. The software will be designed in a single programming language (Java) to assure easy installation across platforms with wizard-based data entry and advanced data reporting. Java will also support the development of advanced graphical user interfaces for data presentation and interactive graphics with a modern look and feel. This approach will ensure that scientists outside of the development institution can develop modules to include in the software or extensions for data integration without challenges of re-compiling the application. The software modules to be developed under this project are Aim 1) peptide and protein level quality assessment and quantification, Aim 2) protein biomarker discovery via exploratory data analysis and machine learning, and Aim 3) pathway biomarker discovery through integration with the NCI Protein Interaction Database.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  For the past decade, cancer researchers have been utilizing global proteomics analyses to extensively categorize proteins and other molecular species in hopes of identifying distinctive features of cancer cells that not only explain the biology, but alo enable better patient care. Despite these investments, relatively few protein biomarkers have achieved clinical validation largely due to naive data analysis strategies used in the protein quantification and statistical validation of candidate biomarkers. This project will develop a robust user- friendly software environment that builds upon state-of-the-art statistical algorithms that are focused on addressing the underlying proteome complexity associated with cancer.            ",Interactive Informatics Resource for Research-driven Cancer Proteomics,8685758,U01CA184783,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Programming Languages', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Sum', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate validation', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrument', 'link protein', 'mathematical methods', 'model design', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2014,419855,19252132,0.010184292720172891
"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.         Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction.

The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects. If successful, this projet will have a dramatic impact on the cost and efficiency of the discovery and development of novel smoking cessation medications, ultimately saving millions of lives and millions of dollars in lost economic output and healthcare costs.",Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery,8901369,R44DA035051,"['Academia', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Affective', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anti-Anxiety Agents', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antismoking', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bupropion', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clonidine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cytosine', 'Data Base Management', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'GABA Agonists', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Mecamylamine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Moclobemide', 'Naloxone', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'Nortriptyline', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Social Welfare', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical efficacy', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'nicotine abuse', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'public-private partnership', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'varenicline']",NIDA,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R44,2014,691074,8428162,0.04648082147872187
"Novel Paradigms For Drug Discovery: Computational Multitarget Screening DESCRIPTION  Abstract:  We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique  for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional  structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective  in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates  computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess  for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption,  distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways.  The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be iteratively  refined using machine learning techniques.  We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight  human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is  the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against  these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community.  In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified  their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of  the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus  far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies.  The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted  lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.  The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive computational drug discovery pipeline, applicable to any  disease, thereby increasing the success rate and reducing the risk, cost, and time associated with traditional  drug discovery methods. This Pioneer award application will focus on the creation and improvement of computational methods to  develop broad spectrum therapeutics against any infectious or inherited disease.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies. The resulting computer simulated models will support major advancements in drug discovery for human health, animal health and related research.            ",Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering,8781169,R44GM100520,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Time', 'Work', 'Yang', 'antibody engineering', 'anticancer research', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'glycosylation', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'screening', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"DNASTAR, INC.",R44,2014,746428,2499981,0.09920514586993741
"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.          Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.           Project Narrative  Some drugs that are approved for sale to the public may have dangerous unknown side-effects. It is important to detect these unknown side effects as soon as possible in order to prevent serious illness or death. This project will help protect the public health by improving the ability to detect unknown dangerous drug side effects earlier and more reliably.",Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance,8588740,R00LM011014,"['Advanced Development', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Boxing', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electronics', 'Encapsulated', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'career development', 'design', 'drug mechanism', 'drug structure', 'drug withdrawal', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'mortality', 'network models', 'novel', 'post-market', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'software development']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2013,187020,209484975,0.0520306694679289
"Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research described in the current proposal has the long-range goals of enabling the prediction of protein-protein interactions and the application of this knowledge to problems of biomedical relevance. An additional long-term goal is the fuller integration of Structural and Systems Biology. Specific Aims include: a) The development of three-dimensional structure-based methods to predict, on a genome-wide scale, whether and how two proteins interact. b) The integration of structural information with other sources of evidence as to protein-protein interactions. c) The application of the methods being developed to important biomedical problems. These research goals are motivated by a number of factors. First, cellular function is mediated by tens or even hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions yet these are generally hard to predict in advance or to measure accurately with high-throughput experimental techniques. A method that allows the computational prediction of such interactions would thus be of significant impact. Second, there are many more protein sequences than protein structures so it is necessary to find ways to amplify the information in protein databases if structure is to be fully integrated in genome scale research. The proposed research is intended to bridge this gap.  A central element of the approach to be taken is the use of structural alignments to reveal novel functional relationships between proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, these alignments can reveal new information. A novel structure-based method is introduced which exploits homology models and remote geometric relationships to amplify structural information. The evidence that is obtained is then combined with non-structural sources of evidence using Bayesian networks to yield a probability of whether two proteins interact. An important element in the proposed research strategy is the recognition that structural modeling on a large scale is necessarily imprecise so that it is necessary to use low resolution ""scoring functions for a given model that do not depend sensitively on atomic detail. Bayesian methods then allow the extraction of a clear signal from the underlying noise.  The biological impact of the research will be enhanced through computational/experimental applications in areas where structural clues have the potential of discovering truly novel interactions. Validated predictions on adhesion proteins, nuclear hormone receptors and cytokine signaling proteins demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology. New applications to viral host interactions and to cancer signaling pathways are described.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health relatedness of the proposed research arises from the fact that a better understanding of protein- protein interactions opens the way to a better understanding of the biology underlying human disease. Applications to interactions involved in viral-host interactions, and in cancer-related pathways serve to highlight this aspect of the proposed research.            ",Computer Studies of Protein Structure and Function,8437358,R01GM030518,"['Adhesions', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Cell physiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Fungal Genome', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Indium', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Hormone Receptors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protein Region', 'Protein Structure Databases', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tropism', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'public health relevance', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,290550,558628098,0.09022386076381134
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8450066,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2013,304962,61050884,0.06301264739428694
"Using Biomedical Knowledge to Identify Plausible Signals for Pharmacovigilance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to monitor unintended effects of approved drugs has been highlighted by several recent high-profile events in which fatal side effects of drugs were detected after their release to market. Notoriously, the Cox-2 inhibitor Rofecoxib (Vioxx) was withdrawn from market on account of evidence suggesting that treatment with the drug increased the rate of coronary artery disease, and recently new evidence has emerged suggesting the commonly used antibiotic Azithromycin (Zithromax) may cause fatal arrythmias. In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality resulting from such undetected side effects, regulatory bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have instituted spontaneous reporting systems to systematize post-marketing surveillance. However there is evidence that under-reporting of adverse drug events (ADEs) is widespread. Automated monitoring of events documented in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as free text or structured data has been proposed as a path toward earlier identification of meaningfully correlated drug-event pairs. As these pairs must ultimately be reviewed by domain experts to assess their implications, there is a pressing need to develop methods to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs within the large pool of correlations to be found in clinical data. In the proposed research, we will develop and evaluate models of biological plausibility, based on knowledge extracted from the biomedical literature and using methods of hyperdimensional computing for efficient search and inference across multiple concepts and relations simultaneously. These methods will be used to selectively identify plausible drug-event pairs found in structured clinical data, and extracted from unstructured data using natural language extraction. The developed methods will be evaluated formatively, for their ability to rediscover known side effects from the biomedical literature, and summatively for their ability to improve the precision of effects attributed to a st of known drugs using statistical methods alone. In addition we will evaluate their ability to predict recent FDA warnings, using historical data and knowledge. If successful, the proposed research will provide the means to identify automatically plausible drug-event pairs for regulatory purposes, mitigating consequent morbidity and mortality. In addition, the methods will provide a generalizable approach that can be used to apply knowledge derived from the biomedical literature to interpret clinical data.              Project Narrative The need to monitor unintended effects of medications has been highlighted by several high-profile events in which fatal side effects of approved drugs were detected after their release to market.

"Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuropeptide Y4 receptor (Y4) is a 375 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is ex- pressed mainly in peripheral tissues and the brain stem. In humans, Y4 belongs to a family of receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5), that bind the ligands neuropeptide Y (NPY), polypeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). NPY, PYY and PP are 36 residue peptide hormones that play critical roles in regulating feeding behavior and energy homeostasis. Y4 is the only receptor subtype with low affinity for NPY and PYY and very high (picomolar) affinity for PP5. Thus, selective agonists of Y4 could be promising candidates for obesity therapeutics. In fact Obinepitide (TM-30338), a variant of PP and PYY, is currently in phase II clinical trials as a treatment for obesity. However as Obinepitide is a peptide, issues of stability and bioavailability remain.  Development of non-peptidic Y4-selective ligands that bind to the endogenous binding site have failed so far.  The objective of the present proposal is to identify small molecule allosteric modulators of the Y4 receptor. Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have a higher chance to be selective as allosteric binding sites tend to be evolutionary less conserved between receptor subtypes. The therapeutic potential of allosteric modulators is further increased by their ability to tune the receptor response instead of simply turning it on or off. Side effects may also be reduced for allosteric potentiators because the therapeutic only acts when the receptor is engaged by its native ligand. In preliminary work, we have adapted a Y4 functional assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments that can detect agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators simultaneously. We con- ducted a pilot screen of 2,000 compounds that yielded several hits including one, Niclosamide that displayed robust, selective allosteric potentiation with an EC50~400 nM.  The proposed experiments will be used in combination with computational methods that enable virtual screening of millions of compounds. We will construct quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to create libraries focused around initial hit compounds and libraries enriched with novel chemotypes predicted to be Y4 allosteric modulators. Identification of small molecule allosteric modulators of Y4 will allow future development of pharmacological probes and can seed drug discovery programs in obesity.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal will explore obesity treatment strategies using small molecule allosteric modulators as probes of Y receptors.            ",Small Molecule Probes to Investigate Structure and Function of Y Receptors,8578312,R01DK097376,"['Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Arrestins', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain Stem', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chemosensitization', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consultations', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Future', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Histamine Receptor', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Obesity', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatic Polypeptide', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Play', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Retinal Cone', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'interest', 'member', 'neuropeptide Y', 'neuropeptide Y4 receptor', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'peptide hormone', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic development', 'tissue-factor-pathway inhibitor 2', 'treatment strategy', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,352032,117374875,0.06095059636625982
"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits. This proposal seeks to investigate the functional importance of this regulatory mechanism and the role played by a group of enzymes that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.          We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis. We will demonstrate the utility of the tool (available also as a mobile application) and overall workflow ourselves by discovering and developing compounds for TB and other infectious diseases.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Predictive Structure-Based Models of Malaria Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed effort is to develop predictive models of future Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild, leading to discovery of novel anti-malarial therapeutics againt drug resistant strains in advance of these mutations. Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.  Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species. Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.  Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide. Two of the most prevalent malaria strains, Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) have developed clinical resistance to antifolate compounds that target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) such as pyrimethamine and cycloguanil. Consequently, there remains a serious and immediate need for the development of novel antimalarial therapeutics that target drug-resistant strains. Using the proposed approach, we will develop predictive models of future Pf-DHFR and Pv-DHFR protein evolution that will facilitate hypothesis generation for likely future mutations in the wild. Afterthe completion of this SC3 research, we plan to integrate these predictive models into a comprehensive computational intelligence- based drug discovery platform thus providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery resulting in timely development of novel anti-malarial therapeutics to meet future needs. This approach will be tested on DHFR for novel antimalarial drug discovery; however, the methods developed can be applied broadly in early stage drug discovery and development.              Approximately forty-one percent of the world's population lives in areas where malaria is transmitted and each year and it is estimated that 350-500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research.

"Identification of Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity using Metabolomics of Human Plurip    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiotoxicity, as a result of adverse drug effects, is a serious problem that has yet to be effectively screened prior to patient exposure. Cardiac safety is one of the leading causes of compound attrition in the pharmaceutical industry and withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The purpose of this proposal is to alleviate the financial burden of compound attrition due to cardiotoxicity, but more importantly, to improve public health through the development of an in vitro assay to predict a drug's ability to induce cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery (""Stemina"") proposes to do so through the use of metabolomics on treated cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. These technologies will be used to discover human endogenous small molecule biomarkers which predict cardiotoxicity, with an emphasis on cardiomyopathy. The use of metabolomics to measure small molecules secreted by human cardiomyocytes in response to drugs is a novel approach and may pave the way for a new generation of more accurate predictive toxicology screens. Stemina has already used such a paradigm to develop predictive methods to assess development toxicology in stem cells. Stemina's long-term goal is to fully develop this humanized, high throughput cardiotoxicity screen so that it would be a valuable tool to pharmaceutical and biotech companies during preclinical development of therapeutics. In order to achieve this long term goal, Stemina is first proposing to establish an experimental platform for each cardiomyocyte culture system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use these systems to develop a dose response curve for each of the 24 compounds (16 cardiotoxic and 10 non-cardiotoxic) as a training set to establish a predictive metabolomic model. These dose response curves will be used to determine 3 concentrations for drug treatment to be utilized in Aim 3. Stemina will then establish a specific metabolic signature of candidate human biomarkers of drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Aim 3). To do so, human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be treated with well-established known inducers and non-inducers of cardiotoxiciy. The spent medium from treated cells will be analyzed with mass spectrometry in order to study the secreted metabolites, or secretome, of these cells. Small molecules whose abundances vary dependent upon whether cells were treated with an inducer or non-inducer of cardiotoxicity will serve as candidate biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. In future studies, these candidate biomarkers will be validated through the use of specialized mass spectrometry techniques. Lastly, the ability of these biomarkers to adequately predict cardiotoxicity will be tested through the use of a blind study. Completion of these aims will encourage further discussions with partnering companies in order to develop a kit that can detect the validated biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Stemina will then utilize this kit to market a service to predict whether or not a compound will induce cardiotoxicity that will serve pharmaceutical companies in pre-clinical screening trials. Such a service will provide the first humanized screening assay for cardiotoxicity based on cardiomyocyte metabolism and will likely improve public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery proposes to develop biomarkers of cardiotoxicity that would drive a service model to predict the cardiotoxicity-potential of drug candidates in order to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients. Such a product will greatly improve public health.           Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human health has benefited tremendously from the therapeutic application of monoclonal antibodies (mAb), treating painful and devastating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, among others. However, mAb development is a laborious and time consuming process. The health benefits gained from faster mAb development are clear, creating a great need for tools to guide scientists toward discovering the most promising antigenic targets-particularly with regard to B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody). The critical barrier to progress in this domain is the inability to deduce the conformational characteristics of protein sequence in the absence of known structure for predicting linear B-cell epitopes-the largest, most diverse, and pharmaceutically valuable class of known epitopes. The general criticism of existing prediction methods is that they are inaccurate and do not address the conformational nature of B-cell epitopes.  DNASTAR proposes to create a software pipeline that guides the prediction of B-cell epitopes, models the dynamic structural interface between a monoclonal antibody and its experimentally identified antigen, and screens in silico site-directed mutations to engineer more potent antibodies with enhanced binding affinity. The Phase I goal is to improve the prediction of antigenic peptides from target protein sequences and experimental or predicted structures. Toward this goal, DNASTAR has established collaborations with experts in monoclonal antibody production, 3D structure prediction, and protein structure and dynamics, including access to their experimental methods, data, and software tools. Our predictive models will benefit from three key innovations: 1) a superior data set and professional insights into monoclonal antibody production, 2) the introduction of state of the art 3D structure prediction for training our epitope predictors, and 3) the first use of structure-based protein dynamics in B-cell epitope prediction.  At the conclusion of Phase I, we will deliver an enhanced sequence-only B-cell epitope prediction model when compared to current top prediction methods (Aim 1) and a superior sequence and structure-based epitope prediction model using 3D structure prediction and protein dynamics (Aim 2). In creating these models, we will account for the chemical and physical properties of a protein sequence and the biophysics that mediate protein-protein interactions, including solvent accessibility, hydrogen bonding, residue flexibility, binding nuclei, and geometric contours of the molecular surface. The proposed software pipeline will be built upon Protean 3D, our new molecular structure and simulation viewer, and will elevate the technical capability of a broad range of experimental scientists to estimate key antigenic structural properties from proteins without known structure-all on their desktop computer. Upon achieving these aims, scientists will recognize that it is no longer adequate to describe B-cell epitopes using amino acid frequencies or propensity scales alone.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases. Unfortunately, the experimental methods used today to identify the most promising immunogenic targets are time consuming and less than totally effective. By taking the novel approach of incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from high quality 3D structure predictions within our desktop computer software product, we propose to advance the ability of a broad range of life scientists to properly predict B-cell epitopes (the part of an antigen recognized by an antibody) applicable to their area of interest. This will accelerate the discovery of new monoclonal antibody pharmaceuticals, leading to improved human health across many diseases.           Monoclonal antibodies are invaluable tools for diagnosing and treating human diseases.

"Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis The goal of this proposal is to discover drug-like retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonists that can halt and reverse the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research strategy is to target ApoE gene expression through RXR agonists; this has recently been shown to improve A¿ turnover, reduction in A¿ plaque area, and the reversal of cognitive, social and olfactory deficits. The research plan consists of two steps. The first step is computer-aided prediction of agonistic RXR binding, blood brain barrier permeability, and absence of side effects. This step relies on a novel method for pharmacophore analysis by examining the joint space of chemical compounds, targets, and chemical/biological properties. This joint space is defined using machine learning on the 3D geometry of spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric points, using attributes such as donors, acceptors, aromatic rings, and charged fragments. The second step consists of biochemical assays including competitive binding with bexarotene, and ApoE level determination in cultured mouse brain cells. A small number of drug-like compounds will be obtained through multiple iterations of the two steps of in-silico prediction and assays at the end of Phase 1. The outcome of this study will be new drug leads to potentially treat and prevent AD at different stages of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Interleaving of computer-aided screening of large chemical databases through novel machine learning based models with biochemical assays will identify drug-like compounds that can clear toxic chemicals responsible for Alzheimer's Disease from brain cells with minimal side-effects. These compounds will form the starting point for the first true cure of Alzheimer's Disease by slowing and reversing its effects.",Discovery of A-beta Oligomer Antagonists via 3D Pharmacophore Space Analysis,8253357,R43GM100664,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bexarotene', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Line', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Competitive Binding', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Headache', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Humulus', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Impaired cognition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mus', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Oral', 'Outcome Study', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RXR', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'drug candidate', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'social', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"ACELOT, INC.",R43,2012,183000,0,-0.045478563407292755
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU). The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches. A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ,8240452,R01GM093147,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Dill', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Docking', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fourier Transform', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Metabolic Control', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Plant Roots', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Potential Energy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Published Comment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transduction Gene', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research study', 'success', 'theories']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2012,308407,61050884,0.06301264739428694
"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia. In silico hit compounds will be experimentally validated and enter hit-to-lead optimization.

"Very large datasets and new models to predict and design protein interactions PROJECT SUMMARY  Specific protein-protein interactions are responsible for organizing the cell, for processing biological signals and information, and for the chemistry of life. Thus, understanding biological mechanism relies on understanding the interactions that occur between proteins. An important long-term goal is to develop methods for reliably predicting and rationally modifying protein-protein interactions. Such capabilities would  provide insight into the molecular details of pathology and highlight opportunities for disease treatment. This proposal describes an integrated experimental/computational technology platform that will provide predictive models of protein interaction specificity. The experimental component involves constructing randomized libraries of proteins or peptides that will be sorted according to their affinities for binding a particular  receptor. The identities and binding affinities for very large numbers of library members will be decoded using high-throughput sequencing methods. The data, consisting of up to 107 {sequence, affinity} pairs per sequencing run, will be used as input to computational machine learning methods. Models will be generated that capture the relationship between sequence and interactions, and the predictive power of these models  will be tested experimentally. The work described in this proposal emphasizes technology development and application of the new platform to study two general types of protein complexes. First are interactions of short helical ligands with mid-sized globular proteins, here studied using anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Ca2+- binding EF-hand proteins. Second are interactions of short linear peptides with modular interaction  domains, here PDZ and SH3 domains. These four protein families mediate an enormous number of important molecular recognition events in human cells, and the resulting models will provide valuable support to study of their biological functions. This work will also provide a stringent test of the capabilities of the proposed technology, which can then be applied to a much wider variety of molecular complexes, e.g., protein-protein, protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid assemblies. Given the paucity of high-  throughput methods for accurately measuring protein-protein interactions, and the primitive capabilities of most computational models for predicting protein binding, the proposed technology platform has the potential to dramatically transform the study of protein interaction specificity. Relevance  Specific protein-protein interactions underlie all biological processes. Knowledge of interactions that occur in healthy vs. diseased tissues, coupled with methods for inhibiting such interactions, would dramatically expand opportunities to treat human disease.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS). By so doing, the rate of discovery of drugs to treat this global tropical disease will be increased.

"Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics,     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are witnessing the growing menace of both increasing cases of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains and the challenge to produce the first new tuberculosis (TB) drug in well over 40 years. The TB community, having invested in extensive high-throughput screening efforts, is faced with the question of how to optimally leverage this data in order to move from a hit to a lead to a clinical candidate and potentially a new drug. Complementing this approach, yet conducted on a much smaller scale, cheminformatic techniques have been leveraged. We suggest these computational approaches should be more optimally integrated in a workflow with experimental approaches to accelerate TB drug discovery. This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project entitled ""Identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis"" describes the development of software that will facilitate new drug discovery efforts for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and the progression of molecules discovered with it as mimics for substrates of enzymes and their in vivo essential genes. In phase 1 we illustrated the concept of loosely marrying the cheminformatic and pathways database that resulted in two compounds as proposed mimics of 2 D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate with activity against Mtb (MIC 20 and 40mg/ml). In phase II via an API we will link the knowledge in CDD, SRI and other databases and tools seamlessly. A researcher will be able to investigate molecules, targets, pathways and then select metabolites or other molecules for pharmacophore analysis, scoring with TB machine learning models and ADME and drug-likeness assessment from within one interface. This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis and be useful for hypotheses testing, knowledge sharing, data archiving, data mining and drug discovery. We will make CDD into a mobile application such that the generalized workflow in this project can be performed anywhere. We present promising preliminary work which resulted in two active compounds, that suggests phase II support of the mimic strategy to identify compounds of interest for TB would be a viable strategy. This proposal balances software development, database development and drug discovery activities in order to achieve our goals. We expect this product could be quickly applied to other infectious diseases which have a great societal impact and as a stretch goal we will endeavor to demonstrate this.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop an integrated system to facilitate new drug discovery efforts for TB using novel logical inference techniques developed by scientists at SRI International, linked with knowledge which has been assembled by the curation of diverse biological data types and computational prediction by Collaborative Drug Discovery (CDD). This tool will be used to aid the identification of novel therapeutics for tuberculosis by combining cheminformatics, diverse databases and logic-based pathway analysis.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids. Our goal is aligned with NIDA's intent to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction. We propose to use tools from a broad range of disciplines, and promise rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of the proposed research to significantly improve treatment of nicotine abuse and addiction. The platform we propose to use will help identify, evaluate, and develop innovative medications to treat nicotine abuse and addiction. We propose to implement a research program through collaborations with academia, industry and government. Although there are two first-line (varenicline and bupropion) and two second-line (clonidine and notriptyline) approved medications for smoking cessation that significantly help to stop smoking, about 80% of smokers are unable to remain abstinent. As an explanation for such low success rate, it has been hypothesized that addiction develops in the presence of predisposing cognitive and affective states, which are unaffected by existing therapeutics but could be targeted by new smoking cessation aids for improved efficacy. One of the main reasons for the slow development of novel medications with improved efficacy is the lack of clearly translatable preclinical models of nicotine dependence that exhibit high degrees of predictive validity. Most preclinical tests are simply based on blocking nicotine-like effects but ignore other predisposing or underlying factors, either cognitive or emotional, that may trigger and maintain nicotine abuse. The availability of both approved medications and failed compounds gives us the opportunity to create a battery of nicotine dependence and CNS efficacy tests with enhanced predictive validity, potentially a key tool in enhancing future discovery and development efforts. During Phase I we will develop a test battery based on 1) consideration of multiple aspects underlying abuse (rewarding effects of acute and chronic nicotine, alleviation of withdrawal, relapse, anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity), 2) definition of a smoking cessation predictive score through a machine learning algorithm trained on a behavioral dataset generated with both effective and ineffective medications in our test battery and 3) minimization of animal and throughput costs. During Phase II the platform will grow to comprise a database of compounds and mechanisms of action of postulated smoking cessation potential, prioritized by their smoking cessation scores and predicted superiority in combating emotional and cognitive aspects of nicotine dependence. Finally, this platform (battery, database and computational tools) will be offered during Phase III as drug screening method to the members of a private public partnership, created to maintain, support, further develop and publicize the platform. The novelty of this project resides in the combination of economic principles and bioinformatics methods to take advantage of existing smoking cessation FDA-approved gold standards, the inclusion of cognitive and emotional state-relevant testing in the proposed preclinical battery, the creation of a knowledge database, and the management of the final platform by a private-public consortium to ensure maximal quality, value and access. We expect that the knowledge and tools generate by this project will stimulate further research and drug development both for smoking cessation and across other areas of drug abuse and discovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predictive Smoking Cessation Preclinical Battery Despite great advances in both the understanding of the neurobiology of addiction and the development and approval of smoking cessation therapies, a significant need remains for better smoking cessation aids.

The existence of several medications for smoking cessation create a major opportunity for the creation of improved research tools for the discovery and development of novel, and more effective, smoking cessation medications. We propose to compare effective smoking cessation medications against ineffective medications in a comprehensive preclinical test battery to capture those features that best separate the two drug sets. We will use novel statistical and computational tools to determine which subset of faster and cheaper tests is necessary to distinguish these two classes to create an optimized predictive test battery. We will then characterize a series of compounds that are thought to be promising candidates for future anti- smoking medications using the novel screening battery. Using bioinformatics methods we will compare these promising compounds against the set of efficacious FDA-approved compounds and assign them a predictive score that represents the likelihood that such compounds will be effective in the clinic. We will further prioritize compounds that show additional positive features such as pro-cognitive or anxiolytic effects.

"High Throughput Screen for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. The molecular basis of DM1 is the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the protein kinase gene, DMPK. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that alter the biology of CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal transcript. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of over a million compounds. An initial screen of 2,500 small molecules from this library resulted in the identification of a potent lead compound, MDI16, which reverses aberrant RNA splice patterns in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in the HSALR mouse model for DM1. In a concerted effort to identify other potent lead compounds we propose the following: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay in the MLPCN center. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary cell-based assays to identify highly potent molecules that reverse four key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Aim 3. Characterize the selectivity and toxicity of lead compounds and identify their mechanism of action at the cellular level using a set of cell-based assays developed in the lab. Aim 4. In conjunction with the MLPCN center, we will refine the chemical structure of lead compounds reiteratively to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure. Over the past few years exciting strides in our understanding of the mechanistic basis of this disorder have been made. Thus the field is poised to make a major breakthrough and develop a drug for this disorder. We have developed a sensitive high throughput screen (HTS) to identify compounds that cure or ameliorate pathologies associated with myotonic dystrophy. Currently we have discovered potent molecules, which rescue DM1 pathology in both DM1 patient myoblasts and in DM1 mouse models. As our screens have been proven to identify potent molecules that rescue DM1 pathology, in this application we propose to identify other lead compounds by screening the MLPCN chemical library with our HTS. Identification of multiple leads will greatly improve the probability of a small molecule therapy for DM1.           Lay Summary Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular disorder for which there is no treatment or cure.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8.

"Mapping the Drugome: predictive network approaches to drug safety surveillance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This application for the K99/R00 ""Pathway to Independence"" program aims to support Dr. Aurel Cami's development into an independent investigator in the field of Biomedical Informatics. The proposed career development period consists of a two-year mentored phase and a three-year independent phase. During the first phase, mentored by Drs. Reis, Kohane, Szolovits, and Manzi, the applicant will obtain formal training in drug safety and in biostatistics/machine learning methods for developing advanced predictive network models. This training will provide the groundwork for the proposed research project. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel surveillance approaches that leverage the inherent network structure of drug safety relationships across the entire drugome in order to predict adverse events earlier and more accurately. The project has four specific aims: 1. Construct and characterize integrated Drug Safety Network representations of the drugome. 2. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-AE associations. 3. Develop predictive network models to identify unknown drug-drug-AE interactions. 4. Systematically evaluate model performance, both retrospectively and prospectively. The preliminary research studies have shown that predictive network models can sensitively and specifically detect drug-AE associations and drug-drug interactions, providing strong motivation for the proposed research. With a background in predictive network modeling and public health drug surveillance, Dr. Cami is highly qualified to conduct the proposed research. This project brings together a broad, interdisciplinary team of mentor, co-mentors and advisors with extensive combined experience in every aspect of the proposed research.           Project Narrative  Some drugs that are approved for sale to the public may have dangerous unknown side-effects. It is important to detect these unknown side effects as soon as possible in order to prevent serious illness or death.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Refinement Methods for Protein Docking based on Exploring Multi-Dimensional Energ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  All successful state-of-the-art protein docking methods employ a so called multistage approach. At the first stage of such approaches a rough energy potential is used to score billions of conformations. At a second stage, thousands of conformations with the best scores are retained and clustered based on a certain similarity metric. Cluster centers correspond to putative predictions/models. Recent work by the proposing team demonstrated that greater prediction quality can be achieved by properly exploring these clusters through a process called refinement. This work resulted in the development of a prototype refinement approach - the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation method (SDU).  The central goal of the project is to build on the SDU success and develop a new high-throughput refinement protocol able to produce predictions of near-crystallographic quality in the most computationally efficient manner. Efficiency will be achieved by leveraging the funnel-like shape that binding free energy potentials exhibit. The specific aims are: (1) the development of a new clustering method that can classify the conformations retained from a first-stage method into clusters suitable for the proposed refinement strategy; (2) the characterization of the structure of the multi-dimensional funnel corresponding to each cluster and the development of an efficient refinement strategy to explore this funnel; (3) the development of a side-chain positioning algorithm appropriate for docking by leveraging Markov random field theory; and (4) the dissemination of the algorithms developed through the release to the research community of a software package and an automated refinement server. It is anticipated that the computational efficiency gains of the proposed refinement protocol over alternative Monte Carlo methods will exceed two orders of magnitude, while, at the same time, significantly improve upon the accuracy achieved by earlier refinement approaches.  A novelty of the proposed work is in its use of sophisticated machinery from the fields of optimization and decision theory specially tailored to the biophysical properties of the docking problem. Techniques from convex and combinatorial optimization, machine learning, and Markov random fields are brought to bear on the refinement stage of multistage protein docking approaches. An important element of the work is the systematic characterization of multi-dimensional binding energy funnels. The existence of such funnels has been long conjectured but it has not led to new docking approaches so far. The proposed algorithms essentially achieve this goal by devising efficient strategies to identify, characterize, and explore these funnels.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein- protein interactions. It will enable treating relatively weak protein complexes involving larger proteins than what is possible today. This will result in a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control, immune response, signal transduction, and gene regulation.          Project Narrative   This work will substantially improve upon computational methods for characterizing and predicting protein-  protein interactions.

"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Reversible protein acetylation and sirtuin function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last several years, accumulating evidence suggests that reversible acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. Recent proteomic investigations have cataloged the existence of hundreds of acetylated proteins, implicating a potential regulatory role for nearly all facets of cellular biochemistry. Interestingly, metabolic enzymes constitute the largest portion of acetylated proteins. Only in a handful of examples has the functional significance of protein acetylation been revealed. Thus, there is tremendous need to determine the regulatory functions of protein acetylation, both at the level of physiological outcomes and at the level of molecular mechanism. This proposal directly investigates the central hypothesis that reversible acetylation is a major regulatory mechanism for controlling protein function. To accomplish these goals, we will investigate the biochemical and biological functions of sirtuins, NAD+dependent protein deacetylases, which are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. The specific aims are focused on demonstrating a direct regulatory role for sirtuins in several major metabolic processes, and elucidating how site-specific acetylation affects enzyme function. Employing mechanistic enzymology, quantitative mass spectrometry, novel high-throughput assays, metabolic pathway analysis, structural biology, enzyme regulation, cell culture models, and mouse genetics, these studies will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the functional significance of reversible protein acetylation. The results have the potential to uncover the prominence of a previously-unknown regulatory mechanism and to transform how we understand metabolic and aged-related diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: New evidence suggests that a previously-unknown form of cellular and metabolic regulation exits.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,10239584,0.07791216130975695
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed drug lead optimization and computational screening exercises.

"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7842572,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2010,327180,61807989,0.05342711345076871
"Cheminformatics of Allosteric mGluR Modulation promotes Therapeutic Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive func-tion. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier. A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt's screening center revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances (1% hit rate) whose activity was validated in independent experiments.  A previous exploratory research grant ""Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics by Virtual High-Throughput Screening"" (R21 MH082254) enabled testing of 813 compounds predicted through cheminformatics. 252 of these compounds were confirmed as active PAMs equaling an enrichment of >30 when compared with the original screen. The present proposal seeks to leverage these proof-of-principle results for the development of a tailored cheminformatics framework for drug discovery of allosteric modulators of brain GPCRs, apply these tools to inform an existing therapeutic discovery program of mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilt University, and disseminate the methods broadly through the NIH molecular libraries program.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators observed in this HTS can be used to generate a pharmacophore of the mGluR5 allosteric site. This map of steric and electronic features necessary for optimal interaction of modulators with mGluR5 will not only inform our understanding of the allosteric modulation of brain GPCRs. The methods proposed overcome limitations of present cheminformatics techniques by enabling identification of novel chemotypes through virtual screening (scaffold hoping), and allowing design of focused libraries in hit-to- lead optimization of novel schizophrenia therapeutics.  The generalizbility of the approach will be tested through application on negative modulators of mGluR5, a potential novel treatment strategy of fragile X syndrome, a CNS disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) among multiple other symptoms. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target brain GPCR. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ligands for specific mGluR subtypes have potential for treatment of a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We will use computational methods identify potentiators of mGluR5, compounds that have exciting potential as treatment strategy for schizophrenia.

"An automated high throughput phenotypic screen for schistosomiasis drug discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease infecting over 200 million people. Treatment relies on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). In the absence of back-up drugs with PZQ's therapeutic spectrum, the risk of resistance to PZQ and eventual drug failure is a major concern. Traditional phenotypic screens, using adult- stage S. mansoni, are low-throughput and incompatible with modern high-throughput screen (HTS) systems. In keeping with the NIAID's mission, the present proposal aims to turn a newly developed, moderate- throughput phenotypic screen (MTS), into a fully automated, quantitative HTS to accelerate drug discovery for this infectious disease. The proposal involves three PIs with ongoing collaborations and respective biological, screening-technology and bio-computational skills who are focused on just this goal. As a first research track for this proposal, we will utilize in-house automation and a high-content screening (HCS) system to significantly increase throughput over our published MTS approach. The proposal will involve; expanding robotic plating of the parasite, developing protocols for bright-field and fluorescence-based microscopy and adapting commercial image-analysis software to identify (segment), quantitatively describe and track the motion of parasites with a view to prioritizing compounds for further pre-clinical development. Because commercial HCS analysis tools are not likely optimized for recording the complex and dynamic phenotypes displayed by this multicellular parasite, we will also pursue a second and parallel track of research. Specifically, we will develop de novo an automated image-analysis screening technology to define, identify, and quantify the range of phenotypic responses (morphological and behavioral) possible in this parasite. Ultimately, both the experimental and computation tracks will together produce a standardized HTS protocol and a comprehensive, quantitative suite of image-analysis programs to categorize parasite phenotypes. Such rigor will facilitate the screening of large numbers of potential compounds and their prioritization into the secondary and tertiary screening assays available in-house. We also intend to make the algorithmic framework including its methods and implementations, publicly available.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of the project is to turn a moderate-throughput phenotypic screen (MTS) system for schistosomiasis, into a fully automated, quantitative high-throughput screen (HTS).

"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements.

"NOVEL PARADIGMS FOR DRUG DISCOVERY: COMPUTATIONAL MULTITARGET SCREENING    DESCRIPTION   Abstract:   We will create a comprehensive computational drug discovery platform by enhancing a novel technique for a dynamic, fragment based, screening of small molecule compounds against the three dimensional structures of multiple protein targets from infectious disease causing pathogens, followed by prospective in vitro and in vivo experimental verification. We will further modify the most promising lead candidates computationally and screen them against all known human proteins and variants simultaneously to assess for side effects against essential proteins, and to ensure that they possess safe and effective absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles against major proteins in known drug delivery pathways. The top ranking leads will again be experimentally verified, and the computational protocol will be itera- tively refined using machine learning techniques. We will initially focus on discovering preclinical drug candidates against infections caused by all eight human herpes viruses (HHVs). This virus family infects billions of humans worldwide every year and is the source of significant mortality in immunocompromised patients. Broad spectrum therapeutics against these key pathogens will benefit the entire global community. In contrast to other computational efforts, my group has successfuly applied and experimentally verified their predictions of inhibitors to treat herpes, malaria, and dengue. This was accomplished at a fraction of the time, effort, and cost typically required by pharmaceutical companies. Our significant successes thus far attest to the efficacy of our drug discovery technologies. The Pioneer Award funds will therefore allow us to bridge the gap of discovering computationally predicted lead compounds and demonstrating their preclinical effectiveness for further clinical and therapeutic use.

"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7617090,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2009,60937,65553150,0.07791216130975695
"Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we seek to continue our development of new innovative computational tools, apply them to model relevant protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and build a publicly accessible web resource to host these tools and models. These goals will be achieved via two Specific Aims. Aim-1 is to develop and validate two new structure-based computational tools. The first tool (Shape4) is a fast, structure-based virtual screening method designed to search large multi-conformer molecular databases for potential ligands for a protein target. It is based on this chief hypothesis: a ligand molecule's topographical shape and pharmacophore features should be complementary to those of its protein binding site. Novel computational geometry and shape modeling algorithms will be employed to fulfill the shape / pharmacophore matching tasks. The second tool (SB-PPK) generates structure-based descriptors for organic molecules. The descriptors so generated depend not only on the structure of an organic molecule, but also on the binding site features of the target protein. Thus, these new descriptors overcome the drawbacks of traditional molecular descriptors that depend only on the structures of organic molecules, regardless of what the target protein is. The new descriptors will be employed in conjunction with QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) modeling workflow to develop predictive models for selected protein targets (Aim-2a). Specifically, the two new methods developed in Aim-1 will be applied to build predictive models for targets from phosphodiesterase (PDE) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) families: PDE- 4, PDE-5, HDAC-7 and HDAC-8. We will then deploy the validated models via a web portal (Aim-2b) to benefit the research community of orphan neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to develop and apply innovative computational tools to study the protein targets of orphan neurodegenerative diseases, and to establish an open-access informatics resource to support the drug discovery efforts in these disease areas. We will ultimately contribute to alleviating the pain of orphan neurodegenerative disease patients.          n/a",Integrated Cheminformatics Resource for Orphan Neurodegenerative Diseases,7559157,SC3GM086265,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chicago', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Huntington Disease', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Marketing', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Models', 'Names', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'North Carolina', 'Orphan', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Productivity', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cheminformatics', 'computer infrastructure', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'conformer', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'method development', 'model development', 'molecular modeling', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'phosphodiesterase IV', 'phosphodiesterase V', 'phosphoric diester hydrolase', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web-accessible']",NIGMS,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,SC3,2009,98400,7249069,0.08671509328714294
"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16).

"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) has assumed center stage in the drug discovery process. Predicting metabolism is one of the major challenges to be met, and metabolism is the most poorly understood of the ADMET processes, and the most difficult to predict. We propose a machine learning approach for improving metabolism prediction, and for gaining insights into metabolism mechanisms, as well as studying differences in metabolism between humans and model animals.             n/a",Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals,7684034,R21ES016920,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'CYP3A4 gene', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hydroxylation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Marketing', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'Xenobiotics', 'absorption', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug metabolism', 'enzyme model', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'meetings', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'public health relevance', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIEHS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2009,306310,0,0.06826731812010921
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7625220,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2009,330166,558628098,0.05342711345076871
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements. These capabilities of reliable measurement of proteins as a function of disease states are essential for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.             n/a",Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling,7676045,R33CA126209,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell division', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Experimental Designs', 'Growth', 'Information Resources', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTPN11 gene', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'database design', 'density', 'design', 'interest', 'meetings', 'microchip', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein profiling', 'research study', 'response', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'technology development', 'tool', 'web-accessible']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R33,2009,494433,31980265,0.042287493198408466

As the cell lines are created, high-resolution fluorescence microscope images will be collected using fluorescence microscopy and the gene and protein tagged in each cell line will be determined by high-throughput molecular analysis methods. The images will be subjected to automated, computerized image analysis to group proteins with statistically indistinguishable patterns. The determined location for each protein will be compared to whatever information is available from protein databases, journal articles and location predictors. Each assigned location will be accompanied by a confidence estimate derived from combining these sources. In addition, the images for each protein group will be used to build generative models that can synthesize new protein distributions statistically equivalent to the original images.

"Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. The time required to bring a new drug into the market has not decreased, though the cost for drug discovery is steadily increasing. The root causes of this problem are related to efficacy, toxicity, and inappropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as shown by recent rigorous analyses. To focus on the ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) issues, pharmaceutical research groups have, since the late 1990s, moved various physicochemical property screens earlier in the drug discovery process. The metabolic transformations of pharmaceuticals profoundly impact their bioavailability, efficacy, chronic toxicity, metabolic idiosyncrasies, excretion rates and routes. Metabolism is one of the major hurdles to overcome. In silico tools enable fast and virtual screening of large numbers of compounds before compounds are synthesized. Such tools enable researchers to recognize complicated metabolic processes, to eliminate poor candidates, and then to use the knowledge gained to discern possible deficiencies in compounds. Still poorly understood, metabolism is the most difficult to predict. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a system to predict xenobiotic metabolism in mammals, and to gain insights into metabolism mechanisms (aim 1), and to study the differences in metabolism between humans and model animals (aim 2). We will use MDL's Metabolite database as a source of information about drug metabolism reactions. For aim 1, we will develop both global metabolism prediction systems, which can be applied to diverse substrate without prior knowledge of enzymes, and local models for particular enzymes, when prior knowledge of the enzymes involved in reactions is available. Global metabolism prediction systems will comprise many individual models, each of which will focus on an animal species (e.g., humans), an enzyme (e.g., CYP3A4) and a specific biotransformation (e.g., hydroxylation). Machine learning techniques will be used to build each individual model using various features to characterize the chemical environments of functional groups within molecules. For local models for an enzyme, we assume that the tight binding of ligands and enzymes is not required, but rather that reactions occur at sites where enzymes can easily attack. We will design ways to model the probability that a particular site will be attacked by enzymes. In Aim 1, both the global metabolism prediction system and the local models are trained on human reactions, so the models are animal specific. In Aim 2, we will build models for rat, which is a model animal in drug development. Using rat reactions listed in MDL's Metabolite database, we will establish a global metabolism system for rats and local models for rats using the same methods outlined in Aim 1. Though the methods are the same, the training sets are different, and it is expected that the models will make different predictions. By using drugs that are known to be metabolized differently in humans and rats, we will study differences in the human and rat models. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In pursuit of novel therapeutics, drug developers are scanning more compounds and covering more chemical space than ever before. ADMET(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicity) has assumed center stage in the drug discovery process. Predicting metabolism is one of the major challenges to be met, and metabolism is the most poorly understood of the ADMET processes, and the most difficult to predict. We propose a machine learning approach for improving metabolism prediction, and for gaining insights into metabolism mechanisms, as well as studying differences in metabolism between humans and model animals.             n/a",Predicting Reactions of Xenobiotic Compounds in Mammals,7531715,R21ES016920,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'CYP3A4 gene', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug toxicity', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hydroxylation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Marketing', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Organism', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Xenobiotic Metabolism', 'Xenobiotics', 'absorption', 'cost', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug metabolism', 'enzyme model', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIEHS,LOS ALAMOS NAT SECTY-LOS ALAMOS NAT LAB,R21,2008,267896,0,0.06826731812010921
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence- based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR¿). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,7490397,R01GM072614,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrostatics', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'SwissProt', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Water', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'repository', 'size', 'stem', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,275880,19199034,0.07090455165977425
"Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed work is to continue developing novel descriptors and informatics/statistical methods that will serve as the building blocks of evolving predictive ADME-toxicology, ADMET, tools, which are accurate, reliable and applicable across a wide diversity of chemistry. The two classes of descriptors being developed are semi-structure based properties from the membrane-interaction [Ml]- QSAR paradigm, and the universal 4D-fingerprint descriptors coming from the 4D-QSAR paradigm. Each class of descriptors has been shown to both enhance the quality of resultant predictive ADMET models when used with 'traditional' descriptors, as well as to lead to significant predictive ADMET models when the 'traditional' descriptors fail in model construction. Moreover, the MI-QSAR descriptors can provide mechanistic information regarding those ADMET properties which involve the interaction of a compound with the membrane of a cell as is the case, for example, for blood-brain barrier penetration. The 4D-fingerprints explicitly contain the 3D conformational distribution information of a molecule. Once computed these descriptors can be stored and subsequently used in any predictive ADMET application. The 4D-fingerpints also provide a general set of molecular features that allow the meaningful estimation of ligand-protein binding, including serum proteins, based on the concept that similar ligands bind in a similar fashion to a common protein. Cluster and categorical statistical methods are to be developed as 'preprocessors' in the building of reliable manifold models from structurally diverse training sets, and the subsequent virtual screening of structurally diverse compounds. Logistic regression, including integration of PLS, will be developed as a tool to optimize categorical ADMET models for classification endpoint data sets, as well as cases where continuous QSAR models of limited reliability might better be replaced by robust categorical models constructed from partitioning the continuous endpoint measures of the training set. These descriptors, statistical and informatics methods, and the predictive tools derived from them, should permit the efficient, reliable and robust prediction of multiple ADMET measures of an organic molecule. These tools may be especially helpful in streamlining pre-clinical drug discovery programs by providing virtual screening information that will early-on in a program eliminate drug-candidates with marginal ADMET property profiles.            n/a",Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling,7455972,R21GM075775,"['Binding Proteins', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'End Point', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Informatics', 'Information Distribution', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum Proteins', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'programs', 'tool', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"CHEM21 GROUP, INC.",R21,2008,278120,0,0.049601117956595296
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7380093,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2008,280033,65553150,0.07791216130975695
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7389563,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,320418,558628098,0.05342711345076871
"Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Confusions between drug names that look and sound alike (e.g., Keppra(r) and Kaletra(r), Indocid(r) and Endocet(r)) continue to occur frequently, and each confusion poses a threat to patient safety.2-5 Our long term objective is to design, build, test and continuously improve tools that minimize the harm caused by drug name confusion errors. For a patient to be harmed, an error must occur and it must go undetected until it reaches the patient. Harm is minimized either by preventing the error from occurring in the first place or by rapidly detecting the error so its adverse effects can be mitigated. Both prevention and mitigation efforts have been hindered by the lack of valid, reliable and efficient methods for assessing name confusion error rates. The gold standard for measuring medication error rates is direct observation of the prescribing-dispensing- administering process. This method is valid and reliable but is too time consuming and expensive to be widely used. As a result, many error reduction interventions have been designed, but few have been tested, and their effectiveness is, for the most part, unknown. Similarly, efforts to mitigate the effects of wrong drug errors are virtually non-existent because there has been no accurate and efficient way to detect such errors after they occur. The key to improving both prevention and mitigation of harm is the development of scalable, efficient, valid and reliable methods for detecting these drug name confusion errors. Our short-term goal is to develop and validate an algorithm for detecting drug name confusion errors by analyzing suspicious patterns in real-world prescription drug databases (in our case, integrated electronic medical records from the US Veterans Health Administration). We plan to test the following three hypotheses: 1. Computerized measures of drug name confusability can be used to identify wrong-drug errors in real-world prescription drug databases. 2. The number of errors detected will increase as the predicted probability of confusion increases. 3. The classification performance of the error detection algorithm (i.e., its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) can be enhanced by applying machine learning techniques and by incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record (e.g., time between refills, diagnosis, lab values, demographics, etc.) To test these hypotheses, we propose studies with the following specific aims: 1. To design and implement an algorithm for the detection of suspicious patterns in prescription drug databases. 2. To test and validate this algorithm using real-world prescription data from the US Veterans Health Administration. 3. To use machine learning techniques to optimize and further validate the performance of the error detection algorithm, incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record. Health care professionals often confuse drug names that look and sound alike. Wrong drug errors occur in hospitals and in community pharmacies and can cause serious harm to patients. Our project seeks to improve patient safety by developing and testing new techniques for detecting wrong drug errors in integrated electronic medical records.             n/a",Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software,7501496,R44RR021232,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Classification', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Indocid', 'Intervention', 'Keppra', 'Lopinavir/Ritonavir', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'computerized', 'demographics', 'design', 'health administration', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prevent', 'sound', 'tool']",NCRR,PHARM I.R.,R44,2008,384760,0,0.029710757698145147
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7471355,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2008,411777,50305751,0.04625703402186488
"Proteomic Phosphopeptide Chip Technology for Protein Profiling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This R21/R33 grant application is in response to NIH/NCI RFA-CA-07-005 for ""Advanced Proteomic Platforms and Computational Sciences for the NCI Clinical Proteomic Technologies Initiative"". Cancers are malignant growths caused by misregulated and uncontrolled cell division; these abnormal cellular activities are typically accompanied by unusual protein expression profiles1. Existing proteomics technologies cannot meet the demand of reliable, sensitive, accurate determinations of these disease-related molecular profiles; to achieve reproducible quality, high throughput, and affordable proteomic analyses, many challenging technological hurdles must first be addressed. We propose developing a proteomic phosphopeptide (PPEP) microchip technology platform that profiles proteins carrying phosphopeptide binding domains (PPBDs); using profiles generated in these experiments, along with predicative computational modeling based on both experimental data and a comprehensive PPEP and PPBD interaction database, we will demonstrate specific and quantitative measurements related to protein functions for proteins of significant biological importance. The strength of our proposed work lies in the integration of an already established array technology and a highly promising bioinformatics platform. The methods developed will enable many researchers to rapidly and vigorously develop peptide arrays for quantitative measurement of the proteins in the biological systems of their own interest or to use standard domain-optimized peptide arrays to systematically profile biological samples of basic research or clinical importance. Over the long term, the methods we develop will be used to establish domain-recognition systems for other types of domain-carrying proteins measurements.

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3.

These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions.

"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents. Our automated cognitive testing system for mice will provide superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput than standard cognitive tests and, with its power to screen libraries in vivo, will discover novel compounds with efficacy in cognition.         n/a",Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers,7169555,R43MH076342,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Basic Behavioral Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mouse Strains', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nootropic Agents', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Somatotype', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2007,199963,8428162,0.016368108607010212
"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7214118,R42ES013321,"['Accounting', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug toxicity', 'End Point', 'Expert Systems', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'highly advanced system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'metabolomics', 'quantum', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'subtraction hybridization', 'tool']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2007,257269,0,0.022550040369988703
"Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed work is to continue developing novel descriptors and informatics/statistical methods that will serve as the building blocks of evolving predictive ADME-toxicology, ADMET, tools, which are accurate, reliable and applicable across a wide diversity of chemistry. The two classes of descriptors being developed are semi-structure based properties from the membrane-interaction [Ml]- QSAR paradigm, and the universal 4D-fingerprint descriptors coming from the 4D-QSAR paradigm. Each class of descriptors has been shown to both enhance the quality of resultant predictive ADMET models when used with 'traditional' descriptors, as well as to lead to significant predictive ADMET models when the 'traditional' descriptors fail in model construction. Moreover, the MI-QSAR descriptors can provide mechanistic information regarding those ADMET properties which involve the interaction of a compound with the membrane of a cell as is the case, for example, for blood-brain barrier penetration. The 4D-fingerprints explicitly contain the 3D conformational distribution information of a molecule. Once computed these descriptors can be stored and subsequently used in any predictive ADMET application. The 4D-fingerpints also provide a general set of molecular features that allow the meaningful estimation of ligand-protein binding, including serum proteins, based on the concept that similar ligands bind in a similar fashion to a common protein. Cluster and categorical statistical methods are to be developed as 'preprocessors' in the building of reliable manifold models from structurally diverse training sets, and the subsequent virtual screening of structurally diverse compounds. Logistic regression, including integration of PLS, will be developed as a tool to optimize categorical ADMET models for classification endpoint data sets, as well as cases where continuous QSAR models of limited reliability might better be replaced by robust categorical models constructed from partitioning the continuous endpoint measures of the training set. These descriptors, statistical and informatics methods, and the predictive tools derived from them, should permit the efficient, reliable and robust prediction of multiple ADMET measures of an organic molecule. These tools may be especially helpful in streamlining pre-clinical drug discovery programs by providing virtual screening information that will early-on in a program eliminate drug-candidates with marginal ADMET property profiles.            n/a",Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling,7268037,R21GM075775,"['Binding Proteins', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease regression', 'End Point', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fingerprint', 'Goals', 'Informatics', 'Information Distribution', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum Proteins', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'programs', 'tool', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"CHEM21 GROUP, INC.",R21,2007,283507,0,0.049601117956595296
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns. Thus, the novel design concept of ""drug inhibitor as a wrapper of functional packing defects"" will be explored and validated. n/a",Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets,7282361,R01GM072614,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrostatics', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Homologous Gene', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'SwissProt', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Water', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'repository', 'size', 'stem', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,284461,19199034,0.07054609507568865
"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7268219,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2007,288025,65553150,0.07791216130975695
"Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY: Over 25,000 researchers in the US and over 50,000 in 120 other countries have exploited the PredictProtein (PP) Internet server to analyze proteins by homology-transfer and by eye novo predictions of protein structure and function. Here, we propose technical and scientific solutions that will improve the functionality of PP and its extension portal META-PP. Many technical changes will remain hidden to users and are required to increase the maintainability, scalability, and portability of these servers. New Graphical User Interfaces are one proposed solution that will visibly impact the service. The scientific solutions address two related tasks pertaining to the prediction of structure and function. The first is to predict the effect of mutations. We propose the development of novel machine learning-based methods to distinguish between mutations that affect structure, function, or have no apparent phenotype. Our final method will be applied to the screening of SNP data from our experimental colleagues at Columbia, as well as to the prediction of SNP effects in public databases. The second major task is the identification of natively unstructured regions and their functional classification. Proteins that do not adopt regular structures in isolation are increasingly becoming an important research area; they may provide a key to the evolution of complexity from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. We propose the development of a machine learning-based identification of features specific to this important class of molecules. We also plan to attack the problem from a very different angle by using predictions of interaction densities inside proteins. The resulting novel tools will allow a proteome-wide analysis of the role of these molecules. All methods will be made available through PP.      RELEVANCE: Information about protein structure adds an entire dimension to protein analysis and genome annotation. This addition is often essential to infer function even for natively unstructured proteins. The PredictProtein server is unique in its combination and exploitation of evolution, structure, and function; many thousands of theoretical, experimental, and clinical researches have benefited from this. The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to improve our ability to use the evolutionary record of amino acid substitutions, i.e. to ultimately understand the amino acid ""language"". The short-term goal is to address two tasks that are closely related to human diseases, namely the distinction between silent and important mutations and the mapping of unstructured proteins onto networks and diseases.          n/a",Improve predictions of structure and function by PredictProtein,7207482,R01LM007329,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Budgets', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Eukaryota', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Induced Mutation', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Point Mutation', 'Progress Reports', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'novel', 'portability', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,323192,558628098,0.05342711345076871
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7264516,R01EB006200,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Drug Industry', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motion', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organelles', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Price', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'charge coupled device camera', 'day', 'discount', 'drug discovery', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'response', 'small molecule libraries', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2007,387827,0,0.04625703402186488
"Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Confusions between drug names that look and sound alike (e.g., Keppra(r) and Kaletra(r), Indocid(r) and Endocet(r)) continue to occur frequently, and each confusion poses a threat to patient safety.2-5 Our long term objective is to design, build, test and continuously improve tools that minimize the harm caused by drug name confusion errors. For a patient to be harmed, an error must occur and it must go undetected until it reaches the patient. Harm is minimized either by preventing the error from occurring in the first place or by rapidly detecting the error so its adverse effects can be mitigated. Both prevention and mitigation efforts have been hindered by the lack of valid, reliable and efficient methods for assessing name confusion error rates. The gold standard for measuring medication error rates is direct observation of the prescribing-dispensing- administering process. This method is valid and reliable but is too time consuming and expensive to be widely used. As a result, many error reduction interventions have been designed, but few have been tested, and their effectiveness is, for the most part, unknown. Similarly, efforts to mitigate the effects of wrong drug errors are virtually non-existent because there has been no accurate and efficient way to detect such errors after they occur. The key to improving both prevention and mitigation of harm is the development of scalable, efficient, valid and reliable methods for detecting these drug name confusion errors. Our short-term goal is to develop and validate an algorithm for detecting drug name confusion errors by analyzing suspicious patterns in real-world prescription drug databases (in our case, integrated electronic medical records from the US Veterans Health Administration). We plan to test the following three hypotheses: 1. Computerized measures of drug name confusability can be used to identify wrong-drug errors in real-world prescription drug databases. 2. The number of errors detected will increase as the predicted probability of confusion increases. 3. The classification performance of the error detection algorithm (i.e., its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) can be enhanced by applying machine learning techniques and by incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record (e.g., time between refills, diagnosis, lab values, demographics, etc.) To test these hypotheses, we propose studies with the following specific aims: 1. To design and implement an algorithm for the detection of suspicious patterns in prescription drug databases. 2. To test and validate this algorithm using real-world prescription data from the US Veterans Health Administration. 3. To use machine learning techniques to optimize and further validate the performance of the error detection algorithm, incorporating additional information from the electronic medical record. Health care professionals often confuse drug names that look and sound alike. Wrong drug errors occur in hospitals and in community pharmacies and can cause serious harm to patients. Our project seeks to improve patient safety by developing and testing new techniques for detecting wrong drug errors in integrated electronic medical records.             n/a",Reducing Drug Name Confusion With Better Search Software,7273372,R44RR021232,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Classification', 'Community Pharmacy', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitals', 'Indocid', 'Intervention', 'Keppra', 'Lopinavir/Ritonavir', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'computerized', 'demographics', 'design', 'health administration', 'improved', 'patient safety', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'prevent', 'sound', 'tool']",NCRR,PHARM I.R.,R44,2007,388793,0,0.029710757698145147
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions.

"Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed work is to continue developing novel descriptors and informatics/statistical methods that will serve as the building blocks of evolving predictive ADME-toxicology, ADMET, tools, which are accurate, reliable and applicable across a wide diversity of chemistry. The two classes of descriptors being developed are semi-structure based properties from the membrane-interaction [Ml]- QSAR paradigm, and the universal 4D-fingerprint descriptors coming from the 4D-QSAR paradigm. Each class of descriptors has been shown to both enhance the quality of resultant predictive ADMET models when used with 'traditional' descriptors, as well as to lead to significant predictive ADMET models when the 'traditional' descriptors fail in model construction. Moreover, the MI-QSAR descriptors can provide mechanistic information regarding those ADMET properties which involve the interaction of a compound with the membrane of a cell as is the case, for example, for blood-brain barrier penetration. The 4D-fingerprints explicitly contain the 3D conformational distribution information of a molecule. Once computed these descriptors can be stored and subsequently used in any predictive ADMET application. The 4D-fingerpints also provide a general set of molecular features that allow the meaningful estimation of ligand-protein binding, including serum proteins, based on the concept that similar ligands bind in a similar fashion to a common protein. Cluster and categorical statistical methods are to be developed as 'preprocessors' in the building of reliable manifold models from structurally diverse training sets, and the subsequent virtual screening of structurally diverse compounds. Logistic regression, including integration of PLS, will be developed as a tool to optimize categorical ADMET models for classification endpoint data sets, as well as cases where continuous QSAR models of limited reliability might better be replaced by robust categorical models constructed from partitioning the continuous endpoint measures of the training set. These descriptors, statistical and informatics methods, and the predictive tools derived from them, should permit the efficient, reliable and robust prediction of multiple ADMET measures of an organic molecule. These tools may be especially helpful in streamlining pre-clinical drug discovery programs by providing virtual screening information that will early-on in a program eliminate drug-candidates with marginal ADMET property profiles.            n/a",Novel Descriptors and Informatics Methods for Predictive ADME Modeling,7009148,R21GM075775,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioinformatics', 'biological transport', 'chemical structure function', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'conformation', 'mathematical model', 'membrane activity', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"CHEM21 GROUP, INC.",R21,2006,291974,0,0.049601117956595296
"Protein Packing Defects as Functional Markers and Drug Targets DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our preliminary structure-based investigations show that water exclusion from deficiently packed hydrogen bonds and other pre-formed electrostatic interactions constitutes a driving factor conferring high specificity to protein association. Thus, an evolutionary conserved feature, the under-dehydrated hydrogen bond, termed dehydron, appears to be a structural marker for interactivity. Dehydrons were experimentally and statistically shown to constitute sticky spots on the protein surface and to be abundant at protein-protein interfaces, especially at those that cannot be understood in terms of standard interactions. The dehydron distribution on the surface of soluble proteins constitutes a determinant of the propensity for association and aberrant aggregation. The identification of dehydrons has relied so far on detailed structural information, a limitation precluding a proteomic analysis. This proposal is geared at introducing a sequence-based predictive method to establish the biological relevance of dehydrons and their potential as markers for drugable targets. Thus, we intend to introduce a powerful unsupervised scanning technology to detect signals of interactivity and drugability at a genomic scale. This goal requires constructing a machine-learning discriminator trained on a structural database. The over-all aim is to develop a sequence-based multi-purpose tool to expand the universe of drugable targets, diagnose propensity for aberrant aggregation and make interactomic inferences. The efficacy of our predictor will be tested on five grounds: a) Assaying for amino-acid variability and determining whether residues predicted solely from sequence to be engaged in dehydrons are actually conserved, b) Using a redundancy-free curated PDB sample as training set, we shall determine the accuracy and precision of the sequence-based predictor using a nonhomologous PDB complement set and annotated SwissProt entries as testing sets, c) Contrasting our results with an alternative dehydron predictor based on a reliable sequence-based predictor of native disorder (PONDR(r)). This dehydron predictor is based on a correlation found between the extent of hydrogen-bond packing and the score of structural disorder, d) Contrasting sequence-based diagnosis of amyloidogenic aggregation with SwissProt annotations and other annotated disease-related sequence repositories; e) Contrasting compiled drug-target quality assessments and structural data and screening profiles for protein-ligand associations with the predicted dehydron patterns.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation.

"LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The high cost ($0.8 - $1.7 billion) and long time frames (about 13 years) required to introduce new drugs to the market contributes substantially to spiraling health care costs and diseases persisting without effective cures. A major factor is the high attrition rate of new compounds failing due to toxicity identified years into clinical trials. This particular circumstance cost the pharmaceutical industry approximately $8 billion in 2003. In silico tools generally offer the promise of identifying toxicity issues much more rapidly than clinical methods, however, they are not sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical companies to confidently make definitive early screening and related investment decisions. LiverTox is a highly advanced, self-learning liver toxicity prediction tool that represents a quantum leap over current in silico methods. It offers a highly innovative use of multiple analytical approaches to accurately predict the toxicity of candidate Pharmaceuticals in the liver. A differentiating capability is its self-learning computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets. They rapidly assimilate massive volumes of information from LiverTox's extensive, dynamic, and thoroughly reviewed databases. Initially, LiverTox will generate predictions derived from five independent CNN-based submodules; one trained in advanced computational chemistry methods to make quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses; a second trained with microarray data; a third trained with Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing and Gene Expression (MPSS/GE) data; and fourth and fifth submodules trained with proteomics and metabolomics/metabonomics data, respectively. Challenging LiverTox with new chemical formulations triggers the five independent submodules to each make toxicity endpoint predictions drawing upon its knowledge base and its similarity analysis/fuzzy logic/statistical training. This tool's flexible, highly advanced system architecture and advanced learning capabilities using data obtained from diverse techniques enable it to rapidly digest new data, build upon new data acquisition techniques, and use prior lessons learned to achieve overall toxicity predictions with greater than 95% accuracy. LiverTox's ability to rapidly and accurately predict the toxicity of drug candidates will allow pharmaceutical companies to move from discovery to curing disease faster, at greatly reduced cost, and with less reliance on animal-based tests.         n/a",LiverTox: Advanced QSAR and Toxicogenomic Software for Hepatoxicity Prediction,7125135,R42ES013321,"['artificial intelligence', 'chemical structure function', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'hepatotoxin', 'microarray technology', 'toxicant screening']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R42,2006,387181,0,0.022550040369988703
"Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Completion of the genomes of humans and several other organisms creates the foundation for translating this rich knowledge base into new products for the improvement of human medicine. A critical component of realizing the promise of genomics efforts is access to well-characterized chemical compounds that bind to and alter the activities of specific gene products. To this end, modern technologies for genome-wide expression profiling and high throughput proteomics provide the enabling foundation for large-scale chemical biology initiatives, using chemical compounds as discovery tools to probe biological pathways, thereby revealing new protein targets that alter cellular phenotypes in potentially beneficial or insightful ways. It is becoming recognized that many critical points of biological pathway regulation are predicated on protein-protein interactions rather than enzyme-based catalysis of cellular products to substrates. Thus, traditional methods of drug discovery are limited in the scope of targets they can adequately address.   Screening scientists are finding that elucidation of cellular responses to chemical compounds at critical points of biological pathway regulation can be enabled by image-based cellular assays that automatically measure protein dynamics via computer vision of pattern and organelle translocations. Subunits of membrane and intracellular receptors often respond by reorganization or translocation. In addition, cellular heterogeneities that are both physiological (e.g., cell division cycle phase-specific) or apparently random can overwhelm whole-well conventional high throughput screening HTS readouts. These are examples of the ways that cell-image-based instruments can dramatically increase the information content of automated assays. The drawback of cell-image-based screening has been that instruments imaging at medium microscopy resolution (approximately 0.5 - 2.0 mu/m with 10-40x objectives) are typically limited to about 25,000 wells per day as compared with rates of 100,000 or more wells/per day for HTS conventional whole-well plate-reader HTS systems. While higher rates have been reported, these increases have been typically achieved by sacrificing resolution (e.g., even lower magnification objectives or substantial camera binning).   Here we propose to increase the fundamental image scanning bandwidth (measured in pixels/s) by 10- fold over the current Beckman Coulter IC-100 instrument, the prototype of which was developed in Dr. Price's academic laboratory and first commercialized by Q3DM Inc. This increase will be gained by application of fundamentally new principles that parallelize auto-focus and image acquisition to scan slides and microtiter plates in long, unbroken continuous-motion multi-color strips. This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7125565,R01EB006200,"['NIH Roadmap Initiative tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2006,399410,0,0.04625703402186488
"Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 65% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and results in renal failure in up to 42% of patients after five years. Renal failure rates can vary up to eight fold over five years in aggressive LN despite use of the same treatment protocol. A more reliable means of determining prognosis is therefore required. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify noninvasive urine protein markers of disease that are predictive of renal compromise. Previous studies in this area have resulted in the identification of a limited number of candidate proteins that correlate with disease type and glomerular inflammatory activity. To develop models of prognostic indicators in a heterogeneous disorder such as LN, the candidate protein approach has limited power. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine: 1) differentially expressed proteins in the urine of LN subjects (revealed by proteomic techniques and artificial neural network (ANN) technology) as surrogate markers of the WHO class, activity, and chronicity of glomerular lesions on renal biopsy and 2) the feasibility of a larger study designed to examine these urine protein markers as predictors of renal outcome in LN. To address these aims, urine from 1) LN subjects undergoing renal biopsy and 2) subjects with either LN or SLE without LN will be analyzed using proteomic techniques. All subjects will be followed prospectively for renal outcomes. Urine proteins will be concentrated and resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Spots will be identified by location and removed for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. Data from these procedures will be analyzed using ANN modeling to determine surrogate urine protein markers of WHO class, activity, and chronicity of LN renal biopsies. ANN will be used to determine surrogate markers that predict compromise in renal function due to LN. These markers will be compared to renal biopsy and traditional laboratory and clinical indices of disease as predictors of renal outcome. Within the two years of this study, surrogate urine protein markers of biopsy findings should be identified, and the feasibility of a long-term outcome study should be determined. The ultimate results of this study could revolutionize the manner in which treatment for LN is determined. Due to the power of proteomic and ANN techniques, novel mediators of disease activity and damage should be identified and thus contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for LN. n/a",Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis,6951552,R21AR051719,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'kidney disorder diagnosis', 'lupus nephritis', 'mass spectrometry', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'protein purification', 'proteomics', 'two dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'urinalysis']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2005,63000,136810522,0.020432014865716757
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,6959048,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2005,162000,157330,0.024985100107364325

"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II. Using this behavior-driven approach, PsychoGenics has already identified two compounds for the treatment of ADD.            n/a",HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1,6851710,R43MH070240,"['antidepressants', 'antipsychotic agents', 'biotechnology', 'cell surface receptors', 'chemical structure', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'computer program /software', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'high throughput technology', 'laboratory mouse', 'mental disorder chemotherapy', 'psychopharmacology', 'tranquilizer']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2005,250000,8428162,0.06881736701612944

This will result in screening speeds of over 100,000 wells per day using medium resolution objectives (10-40x dry magnification). n/a",Continuous-Imaging HT Screening Instrument(RMI),7012638,R01EB006200,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biotechnology', 'charge coupled device camera', 'computer program /software', 'computer system hardware', 'high throughput technology', 'image enhancement', 'robotics']",NIBIB,SANFORD-BURNHAM MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTIT,R01,2005,363523,0,0.04625703402186488
"Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Lupus nephritis (LN) affects up to 65% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and results in renal failure in up to 42% of patients after five years. Renal failure rates can vary up to eight fold over five years in aggressive LN despite use of the same treatment protocol. A more reliable means of determining prognosis is therefore required. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify noninvasive urine protein markers of disease that are predictive of renal compromise. Previous studies in this area have resulted in the identification of a limited number of candidate proteins that correlate with disease type and glomerular inflammatory activity. To develop models of prognostic indicators in a heterogeneous disorder such as LN, the candidate protein approach has limited power. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to determine: 1) differentially expressed proteins in the urine of LN subjects (revealed by proteomic techniques and artificial neural network (ANN) technology) as surrogate markers of the WHO class, activity, and chronicity of glomerular lesions on renal biopsy and 2) the feasibility of a larger study designed to examine these urine protein markers as predictors of renal outcome in LN. To address these aims, urine from 1) LN subjects undergoing renal biopsy and 2) subjects with either LN or SLE without LN will be analyzed using proteomic techniques. All subjects will be followed prospectively for renal outcomes. Urine proteins will be concentrated and resolved by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Spots will be identified by location and removed for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting. Data from these procedures will be analyzed using ANN modeling to determine surrogate urine protein markers of WHO class, activity, and chronicity of LN renal biopsies. ANN will be used to determine surrogate markers that predict compromise in renal function due to LN. These markers will be compared to renal biopsy and traditional laboratory and clinical indices of disease as predictors of renal outcome. Within the two years of this study, surrogate urine protein markers of biopsy findings should be identified, and the feasibility of a long-term outcome study should be determined. The ultimate results of this study could revolutionize the manner in which treatment for LN is determined. Due to the power of proteomic and ANN techniques, novel mediators of disease activity and damage should be identified and thus contribute to the development of more targeted therapies for LN. n/a",Urine protein markers of disease in lupus nephritis,6838455,R21AR051719,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'kidney disorder diagnosis', 'lupus nephritis', 'mass spectrometry', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'prognosis', 'protein purification', 'proteomics', 'two dimensional gel electrophoresis', 'urinalysis']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2004,63000,136810522,0.020432014865716757

"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,0,0.041413074381282125
"Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This project bridges the understanding between physical and chemical principles and genomic/proteomic response by integrating three independent parallel toxicity prediction tools. Each uses computational neural networks (CNNs) and wavelets to rapidly and accurately make pharmaceutical/chemical toxicity predictions. A CNN-based Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) module makes toxicological predictions based only on structure-activity analyses; a second CNN/wavelet module makes independent toxicogenomic predictions using microarray data; and a third CNN/wavelet module makes toxicogenomic predictions using Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) data. This multi-intelligent, three-module approach provides crosschecks to reduce false positives and false negatives while substantially increasing confidence in predictions relative to current computer-based toxicity prediction techniques. The resulting product could potentially become a primary tool used by (a) human health researchers, b) pharmaceutical companies for screening drugs early during development, c) companies designing/developing new chemicals and chemically treated materials, and (d) government organizations (e.g., military) for mission-related chemical deployments. Public benefits include reduced health and environmental risks (e.g., 4 out of 5 chemicals in use today have inadequate testing); reduced reliance on animal testing; and reduced time and cost required to bring new pharmaceuticals and chemicals into beneficial medical and commercial use.            n/a",Use of Microarray Test Data for Toxicogenomic Prediction,6743871,R41ES013321,"['computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'evaluation /testing', 'method development', 'microarray technology', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'toxicant screening', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"YAHSGS, LLC",R41,2004,211770,0,0.018509396158809515
"HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The current trend in drug discovery is to develop drugs with a high level of selectivity for a single receptor. Although this is a real improvement for certain therapeutic areas, this may present a real issue for the development of novel treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Indeed, neuropsychiatric disorders are complex, multigenic disorders that involve multiple neuronal circuits. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of the most efficacious drugs in psychiatry, such as clozapine, are considered ""dirty drugs"" (i.e. have multiple targets), that were discovered by screening in vivo, i.e. looking at their behavioral impact using various animal models, rather than making predictions of their function based on their receptor profile. Although attractive, this approach was neither efficient nor scalable until now. PsychoGenics is developing a proprietary, high throughput, in vivo platform known as Smart Cube TM, which is being used to screen and select drug candidates with potential to treat major psychiatric disorders including depression, psychosis, and anxiety disorders. This approach examines the behavioral response of a mouse to various challenges under normal and perturbed (e.g. drug treated) conditions. Using computer vision algorithms, behavior is captured and bioinformatic tools are applied to reveal the temporal behavioral profile or ""signature"" in response to treatment.  PsychoGenics is building a database of signatures for known and approved compounds, which it can use to compare to the profiles of NCEs. PsychoGenics aims to demonstrate that this behavior-driven approach to drug discovery can yield clinical candidates selected from high quality libraries designed with compounds that have drug-like chemical and structural properties. The goal is to screen 120 compounds in Abstract compounds in Smart CubeTM in Phase I to find ""hits"" which, with the aid of novel computational chemistry algorithms, undergo behavior-driven (i.e. Smart Cube TM) lead optimization in Phase II. Using this behavior-driven approach, PsychoGenics has already identified two compounds for the treatment of ADD.            n/a",HIGH THROUGHPUT IN VIVO DRUG DISCOVERY-PHASE 1,6744702,R43MH070240,"['antidepressants', 'antipsychotic agents', 'biotechnology', 'cell surface receptors', 'chemical structure', 'combinatorial chemistry', 'computer program /software', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'high throughput technology', 'laboratory mouse', 'mental disorder chemotherapy', 'psychopharmacology', 'tranquilizer']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2004,250000,8428162,0.06881736701612944

"DRUG MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FOR NCI CLINICAL TRIALS DDOTS was awarded a Phase I SBIR contract to create an algorithmic computer model which inventories and tracks all investigational drugs used in NCI-sponsored clinical trials. DDOTS met all of the requirements of the project with the development of a stand-alone system for pharmacy use entitled ""Investigational Drug Environmental Accountability"" (IDEA). At the request of the NCI's CTEP informatics workgroup, the project was extended for a period of six months in order to allow DDOTS to create and align the IDEA drug accountability file submission format for inclusion in the Drug Authorization and Review Tracking System (DARTS) being developed for NCI's Pharmacy Management Branch. Having successfully accomplished the above, the primary specific aim of this Phase II proposal is the actual production of the IDEA software system. The IDEA software program will be installed and operationalized at two beta test sites: the Ann Arbor Regional CCOP in Ann Arbor, Ml and the Carle Cancer Center in Urbana, IL. There is no investigational drug management and auditing software program presently available in either the commercial market or from health care organizations. The IDEA software provides a state-of-the-art technologic tool which serves to meet both the needs of cancer research sites and the NCI for improved efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in the overall investigational drug management and inventory process. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Although the IDEA software is being developed for NCI-sponsored research programs, broad applicability exists for its use by all organizations conducting drug research, i.e., comprehensive cancer programs, university hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies.  n/a",DRUG MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FOR NCI CLINICAL TRIALS,6071505,R44CA078105,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug screening /evaluation', ' informatics']",NCI,"DDOTS, INC.",R44,2000,375000,0,0.018176258580613742
