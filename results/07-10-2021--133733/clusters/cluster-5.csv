"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,136810522,-0.02869120611056888
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,560644462,0.058284576755892374
"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records. Distributing predictable practices of medical specialty consultations can then enable healthcare systems to achieve broader patient access to timely and consistent care.",Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care,10265158,R56LM013365,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Mail', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'data streams', 'design', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,394250,560644462,0.07218966242870714
"Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY Screening mammography saves lives but human interpretation alone is imperfect and is associated with significant harms including ~30,000 missed breast cancers and ~3.8 million false-positives exams each year in the U.S. alone. Traditional computer-aided detection failed to improve screening accuracy, in part due to the static nature of software trained and tested on small datasets decades ago. Recent advances in improved computer processing power, cloud-based data storage capabilities, and availability of large imaging datasets have led to renewed excitement for applying artificial intelligence (AI) to mammography interpretation. We propose a unique academic-industry partnership to validate, refine, scale, and clinically translate our proven 2D mammography AI algorithm to 3D mammography interpretation. Our team helped organize and lead the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) Digital Mammography Challenge, an open crowdsourced AI algorithmic challenge that provided >640,000 digital 2D mammogram images and associated clinical metadata to >1,200 coding teams worldwide. Our industry partner for this grant, DeepHealth, Inc., was the top performing team in the DREAM Challenge. With >50% of U.S. facilities now offering 3D mammography for screening, the 50-to-100-fold increase in imaging data represents a new critical barrier for both radiologists and AI algorithm developers. To date, there have been few publications addressing AI-enhanced interpretation of 3D mammography, the emerging screening exam of choice. We will validate our post-DREAM algorithm for 2D mammography (which currently rivals human interpretation alone) using UCLA's Athena Breast Health Network, one of the largest population-based breast imaging registries. We will enhance our 2D AI algorithm with expert radiologist supervision and examine the impact of adding novel non-imaging data parameters, including genetic mutation and tumor molecular subtype data, to help train the AI model to identify more clinically significant cancers. We will use several novel technical algorithmic approaches to scale from 2D to 3D mammography which, in our preliminary studies, have shown improved accuracy beyond radiologist interpretation alone. Finally, we will perform a series of interpretive studies to identify the optimal interface between “black box” outputs and radiologist interpreters, which remains an understudied topic. With >40 million U.S. women undergoing screening each year, seemingly small improvements in overall accuracy would still imply significantly improved population-based outcomes. In summary, we have assembled an unparalleled multidisciplinary team with expertise in machine/deep learning, breast cancer screening accuracy, medicine, oncology, radiology, imaging technology assessment, and biostatistics. We have a proven track record of strong collaboration and are well positioned to validate, enhance, scale, and translate our proven 2D AI algorithm for improved 3D mammography accuracy. Our new end user tool will help tip the balance of routine screening towards greater benefits than harms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current interpretation of screening mammography suffers from human limitations, leading to approximately 30,000 missed cancers and 3.8 million false positives exams every year in the U.S. alone. Our multidisciplinary team of experts on breast cancer screening, machine and deep learning, data science, and imaging technology assessment will validate our highly accurate 2D mammography artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that was the best performer in an international competition with >1,200 participants and then further enhance it with novel AI augmentation methods. We will then apply innovative techniques to scale the AI algorithm from 2D to 3D mammography, addressing the issue of a 50-to-100-fold increase in volumetric data with 3D exams, and then clinically translate our optimized AI 3D mammography tool through a series of interpretive accuracy studies involving experienced and inexperienced radiologists from both academic and community practices.","Artificial Intelligence for Improved Breast Cancer Screening Accuracy: External Validation, Refinement, and Clinical Translation",9912472,R37CA240403,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Community Practice', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publications', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'long short term memory', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R37,2020,547285,533302350,0.011953069654287244
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9926229,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,625336,641965656,0.04076288839455207
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,241268189,0.08276662685631259
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women.

"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern. Diagnostic tools that can distinguish between varying etiologies of infection are necessary to curb this growing problem.",Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship,9847554,R41AI148088,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptosis', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Buffers', 'C-reactive protein', 'Car Phone', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interleukin-6', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specimen', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'assay development', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'combat', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'procalcitonin', 'protein Mx', 'research clinical testing', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'software development', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"PRAGMADX, INC.",R41,2019,151894,0,0.03515621870259541
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9717098,K24CA194251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resource Development', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer care', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'evidence base', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized strategies', 'population based', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2019,173648,338121506,0.053302418923488554
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,560644462,0.12805488880288562
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,9847578,R44CA240022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Callback', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Improve Access', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'success', 'symposium', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,252810,919121,-0.0035690709217822353
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,560644462,0.058284576755892374
"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9724474,R01EB021360,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'case-based', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'continuing medical education', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'radiologist', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,469394,607172798,0.020071476830975526
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9624294,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,653319,641965656,0.04076288839455207
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9631317,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,656406,1273999,0.08276662685631259
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,560644462,0.12805488880288562
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,9406887,R00LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R00,2018,248969,551214295,0.07098326343465085
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9495679,K24CA194251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resource Development', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer care', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'evidence base', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'personalized strategies', 'population based', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2018,322232,338121506,0.053302418923488554
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,560644462,0.058284576755892374
"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9463552,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694555,1273999,0.08276662685631259
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9297263,K24CA194251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resource Development', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'evidence base', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized decision', 'personalized strategies', 'population based', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2017,173648,338121506,0.053302418923488554
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,560644462,0.12805488880288562
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees.

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,9281905,R01LM011663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical efficacy', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'treatment choice', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,460025,570146095,0.026856431794279472
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,548074,641965656,0.06454323688753029
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,1273999,0.08276662685631259
"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,9110927,K24CA194251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'evidence base', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized decision', 'personalized strategies', 'population based', 'population health', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2016,147059,338121506,0.053302418923488554
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,560644462,0.12805488880288562
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or “3D mammography” brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the “one size fits all” approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual’s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education. Digital breast tomosynthesis is becoming a standard practice in breast cancer screening and there is a pressing need for effective education in this new modality. In this study we propose to develop a computer system for education in digital breast tomosynthesis that adapts itself to each trainee and to find an individualized training protocol that fits best the trainee’s needs. Such system could improve dramatically the time efficiency of training in digital breast tomosynthesis images and improve diagnostic performance of the trainees. This is likely to improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer screening and, given high importance of breast cancer screening, decrease mortality rate of the disease.",Machine learning and collaborative filtering tools for personalized education in digital breast tomosynthesis,9177536,R01EB021360,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'case-based', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'continuing medical education', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'prediction algorithm', 'radiologist', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,389204,607172798,0.020071476830975526
"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,9067517,R01LM011663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Trastuzumab', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predicting response', 'treatment choice', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,460025,570146095,0.026856431794279472
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,9143689,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2016,522865,276703803,0.09255688712793612
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,641965656,0.06454323688753029
"A Real-Time Feedback System For Radiological Reporting To Reduce Diagnostic Varia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the United States. It is the second leading cause of cancer deaths amongst women, resulting in 39,000 deaths per year. As a result, much work has been done to optimize the evaluation of cancer through mammography. However, assessing mammograms is limited by variations among practitioners in practice, including deficiencies in their reporting of these imaging examinations as well as in their interpretations. Two main sources of these variations in practice are incompleteness of the radiological observations reported to characterize the abnormalities seen in images and inconsistency of these observations with respect to the radiologists' overall impression. We hypothesize that the quantification and enforcement of completeness and consistency of radiological observations will improve the positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography. We propose a decision support system that provides feedback to radiologists during the reporting of their radiological observations. We will develop this system by creating novel statistical models to link radiological observations, computational imaging features, and disease to recognize incompleteness and inconsistency in reporting. We will then harness these models to create a quantifiable metric of observation quality. We propose a research plan with the following specific aims: (1) To characterize breast lesions seen in mammography images by capturing computationally- derived (""quantitative"") imaging features and radiologist-derived observational (""semantic"") features, (2) develop a radiological Decision Support System (DSS), (3) evaluate our DSS in mammography practice. Our methods will lead not only to better diagnostic accuracy and positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography, but they will be extensible to other imaging domains and possibly to other medical domains where diagnostic reasoning is documented in dictated reports. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this project have the potential to impact the consistency and completeness of mammography reporting methods. This will potentially positively impact communication between referring physicians and mammography specialists as well as provide better positive predictive value of mammograms. It is relevant to better diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.",A Real-Time Feedback System For Radiological Reporting To Reduce Diagnostic Varia,8902057,F31CA171789,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast imaging', 'breast lesion', 'computer based statistical methods', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'excessive anxiety', 'impression', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'screening']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,9495,560644462,0.0437047483726877
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8837582,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2015,59966,685608202,-0.019720557823819658
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K24 proposal combines mentoring in patient oriented cancer control research; research to translate evidence-based shared decision-support for screening mammography to the clinic; and career development in Implementation Science. The PI, Dr. Elizabeth Burnside, has been an influential mentor throughout her career at the University of Wisconsin (UW), fostered by leadership positions like her role as the co-lead of the Cancer Control Program in the UW NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her mentoring and research both promote team science, which unites medical and ""translational"" disciplines like informatics, engineering, and population health, all areas for which she has expertise and departmental affiliate appointments. This award would carve out the necessary time for her to build a platform on which to formalize her mentoring approach and a curriculum to support a cadre of physician/scientists developing decision support tools aimed for clinical translation. This proposal takes advantage of a successful Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded at UW in 2006, committed to mentoring, patient oriented team science, and translational research. The aims included in this proposal are closely aligned with the UW CTSA -KL2 and other institutional training grants and fully leverage the rich mentoring and career development resources.  The patient oriented scientific aims proposed arise from healthcare shortfalls that she, a radiologist practicing in breast imaging, sees every day in clinic. They buid on her NCI funded R01 which asks the question: How can decision support in the clinic help healthcare providers optimize breast cancer screening and diagnosis in aging women? Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women = 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized strategies are needed to decrease morbidity and mortality, while minimizing harms (false positives and overdiagnosis-the detection of cancer that would not go on to cause symptoms or death). Though validated decision aids currently exist, immense opportunities still remain: personalization, integration in the clinical workflow, and implementation with high fidelity; all goals of this proposal. Personalized decision support tools will only be useful if they are thoughtfully designed and rigorously implemented.  Both her scientific aims and her career development plans integrate the new discipline of Implemenation Science. These methodologies will enable her to translate advances into an EMR-embedded decision tool for improved breast cancer screening decision-making for women = 65 and their physicians. Innovation is substantial; creating a tool that incorporates national simulation models to accurately convey outcomes that is integrated into the EMR has not been done. This award will enable Dr. Burnside to become an influential mentor of clinician-scientists using implementation science to advance personalized decision support into the clinic.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant proposes to build a mentorship program for clinicians who are developing tools that use a patient's unique characteristics to help make optimal health care decisions. The proposed research exemplifies this important goal by using the newest scientific techniques to develop and test a personalized decision tool to help women age 65 or over decide (with their physician) whether to undergo breast cancer screening. By combining mentoring, research, and new scientific methodologies, this plan will powerfully translate the science of personalized prediction to patients to help make decisions that are right for them.            ",Mentoring And Research In Patient-Oriented Breast Cancer Diagnosis,8869631,K24CA194251,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Influentials', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Planning Techniques', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'design', 'evidence base', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'population based', 'population health', 'preference', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'surveillance network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K24,2015,146019,338121506,0.053302418923488554
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,560644462,0.12805488880288562
"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assit the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.      Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.      Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only o patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.      We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems. Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8856659,R01LM011663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'response', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,452719,570146095,0.026856431794279472
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8926887,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2015,522865,276703803,0.09255688712793612
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,641965656,0.06454323688753029
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8656952,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2014,9945,227555357,-0.019720557823819658
"A Real-Time Feedback System For Radiological Reporting To Reduce Diagnostic Varia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the United States. It is the second leading cause of cancer deaths amongst women, resulting in 39,000 deaths per year. As a result, much work has been done to optimize the evaluation of cancer through mammography. However, assessing mammograms is limited by variations among practitioners in practice, including deficiencies in their reporting of these imaging examinations as well as in their interpretations. Two main sources of these variations in practice are incompleteness of the radiological observations reported to characterize the abnormalities seen in images and inconsistency of these observations with respect to the radiologists' overall impression. We hypothesize that the quantification and enforcement of completeness and consistency of radiological observations will improve the positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography. We propose a decision support system that provides feedback to radiologists during the reporting of their radiological observations. We will develop this system by creating novel statistical models to link radiological observations, computational imaging features, and disease to recognize incompleteness and inconsistency in reporting. We will then harness these models to create a quantifiable metric of observation quality. We propose a research plan with the following specific aims: (1) To characterize breast lesions seen in mammography images by capturing computationally- derived (""quantitative"") imaging features and radiologist-derived observational (""semantic"") features, (2) develop a radiological Decision Support System (DSS), (3) evaluate our DSS in mammography practice. Our methods will lead not only to better diagnostic accuracy and positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography, but they will be extensible to other imaging domains and possibly to other medical domains where diagnostic reasoning is documented in dictated reports.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this project have the potential to impact the consistency and completeness of mammography reporting methods. This will potentially positively impact communication between referring physicians and mammography specialists as well as provide better positive predictive value of mammograms.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.          PROJECT NARRATIVE Our multidisciplinary group of breast cancer physicians and computer scientists propose to develop a new paradigm for construction of clinical decision support tools that will integrate machine learning (computers learning from data) and physician expertise in order to perform better than either alone.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,641965656,0.06454323688753029
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System  Critical clinical activities involve decision making. For both individual patients and for society at large, making good healthcare decisions is a paramount task. The objective of this research is to develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient.  Traditional clinical data are becoming increasingly available in electronic form. Unprecedentedly abundant genomic data are available to researchers as the results of advanced sequencing technologies such as next generation sequencing. Patient-specific genomic data are likely to become available for most patients in the foreseeable future. These sources of data provide significant opportunities for developing new generation clinical decision support systems that can achieve substantial progress over what is currently possible. However, the sheer magnitude of the number of variables in these data (often in the millions) presents formidable computational and modeling challenges. Also, integrating the heterogeneous information in multiple clinical datasets and genomic datasets presents an arduous challenge.  Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women. Various breast cancer subtypes have been defined which, along with tumor stage, predict response to therapy and survival, albeit imperfectly. For example, HER2-amplified breast cancer is a subtype with poor prognosis, and therapy with an antibody to HER2 (Herceptin) has vastly improved the survival of such patients. Although Herceptin is used in the therapy of all patients with HER2-amplified tumors, only some respond. Also, it is expensive and can cause cardiac toxicity. So, it is important to give it only to patients benefiting from it. Studies show thousands of genes are associated with subtype and prognosis of breast cancer, and particular allele combinations may usefully guide the selection of effective treatment. The proposed system will amass all this genomic information and combine it with clinical information and therefore holds promise to provide accurate classification and treatment choices.  We will build the knowledge base of the proposed system using the following sources: 1) The Medical Archival Systems at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center; 2) The Lynn Sage Database used by the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital; 3) The breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project; and 4) Dream 7 Breast Cancer Challenge Data. The proposed system will build on previous results of the investigators in using Bayesian Network to learn from high-dimensional data sets. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record, including NIH funding, publications in biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence, and experience developing cutting-edge decision support systems.  Even a modest improvement in the efficacy of clinical decision making has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project will develop a novel decision support system that utilizes both the clinical features and the genomic profile of a breast cancer patient to assist the physician in integrating information about a specific patient (diagnostic subtype, tumor stage and grade, age, comorbidities) to make therapeutic plans for the patient. We call this system A Clinical Decision Support System for Making Personalized Assessments and Recommendations Concerning Breast Cancer Patients (DPAC).",A New Generation Clinical Decision Support System,8695607,R01LM011663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Electronics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Societies', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'response', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,582816,570146095,0.02561942919268137
"A Real-Time Feedback System For Radiological Reporting To Reduce Diagnostic Varia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer affects 1 in 8 women in the United States. It is the second leading cause of cancer deaths amongst women, resulting in 39,000 deaths per year. As a result, much work has been done to optimize the evaluation of cancer through mammography. However, assessing mammograms is limited by variations among practitioners in practice, including deficiencies in their reporting of these imaging examinations as well as in their interpretations. Two main sources of these variations in practice are incompleteness of the radiological observations reported to characterize the abnormalities seen in images and inconsistency of these observations with respect to the radiologists' overall impression. We hypothesize that the quantification and enforcement of completeness and consistency of radiological observations will improve the positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography. We propose a decision support system that provides feedback to radiologists during the reporting of their radiological observations. We will develop this system by creating novel statistical models to link radiological observations, computational imaging features, and disease to recognize incompleteness and inconsistency in reporting. We will then harness these models to create a quantifiable metric of observation quality. We propose a research plan with the following specific aims: (1) To characterize breast lesions seen in mammography images by capturing computationally- derived (""quantitative"") imaging features and radiologist-derived observational (""semantic"") features, (2) develop a radiological Decision Support System (DSS), (3) evaluate our DSS in mammography practice. Our methods will lead not only to better diagnostic accuracy and positive predictive value of diagnostic mammography, but they will be extensible to other imaging domains and possibly to other medical domains where diagnostic reasoning is documented in dictated reports.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this project have the potential to impact the consistency and completeness of mammography reporting methods. This will potentially positively impact communication between referring physicians and mammography specialists as well as provide better positive predictive value of mammograms. It is relevant to better diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.            ",A Real-Time Feedback System For Radiological Reporting To Reduce Diagnostic Varia,8529122,F31CA171789,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast lesion', 'computer based statistical methods', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'impression', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,42232,560644462,0.0437047483726877
"Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Optimized optics and feedback-controlled microscope hardware permit efficient acquisition of large, high- quality image datasets. Computer-based analyses deliver fast processing of high volume of image data which manually cannot be accomplished. The most exciting contribution that computer vision systems can make to translational cancer research, however, is to give access to image-based information that is inaccessible by eye. Computer vision programs can be directly coupled to mathematical models that describe the relation between hidden, invisible processes and measurable image events. Changes in the behavior of hidden processes are thus detectable as changes in the image. This study envisages the use of such algorithms to obtain statistically representative results for the differential effects of each of the three FDA-approved taxanes on the microtubule cytoskeleton in prostate cancer (PC) cell lines. My previous work in basic research has demonstrated the ability of computer-based analysis of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton to distinguish between weak disease phenotypes and establish links to MT dynamics in renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, the proposed translational research project can impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians for the first time with a computer-aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized MT-targeting chemotherapy of metastatic PC patients. Metastatic PC is treated primarily by means of taxane-based chemotherapy with one of the three FDA- approved taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and cabazitaxel). However, currently there is no way of selecting the taxane for chemotherapy based on the particular pattern of dynamic behavior of the MT cytoskeleton in individual patients. In addition, recent data have indicated that AR binds MTs in order to traffic to the nucleus and that there are several clinically relevant AR splice variants i metastatic PC patients. To date, there is no information available on the potential effects of wild type or variant AR on MT dynamics and consequently no information on differential metastatic PC cell response to taxane treatment as a function of cellular AR content. Based on preliminary research, we hypothesize that there are inherent differences in tumor MT dynamics among individual PC patients, and that the presence of AR variants affects specific parameters of MT polymerization dynamics. If correct, this hypothesis has very significant implications for PC treatment. Because different microtubule-targeting drugs (even from within the same class like the taxanes) affect distinct parameters of MT dynamics, it is conceivable that we can match each drug with an individual tumor-specific ""MT-dynamics signature"" for maximum therapeutic efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We envision that a systematic characterization of microtubule dynamics and their response to taxanes will allow chemotherapy customization and prolong survival of castrate-resistant prostate cancer patient. The proposed study has the potential to impact clinical decision-making by equipping physicians with a computer- aided tool allowing the design of an effective personalized medical treatment. In addition, it will bring insight into the mechanisms of inherent and acquired resistance to microtubule-targeting drugs.            ",Computational Analysis of Microtubule Dynamics for Personalized Cancer Therapy,8526929,F32CA177104,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Event', 'Eye', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Microscope', 'Microtubule Polymerization', 'Microtubule Stabilization', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'PC3 cell line', 'Paclitaxel', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Scheme', 'Second Primary Neoplasms', 'Taxane Compound', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubulin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cellular targeting', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'docetaxel', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'taxane', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F32,2013,53942,227555357,-0.019720557823819658

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively.

Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way.

In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial.

"Integrating Machine Learning and Physician Expertise for Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop novel machine learning techniques to integrate physician expertise and machine learned, logical rules in a graphical model that will accurately estimate breast cancer risk after breast biopsy. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical and computer science literature) illustrating an innovative research program that merges cutting edge machine learning algorithms including inductive logic programming and statistical relational learning to train graphical models to predict breast cancer risk. However, in contrast to prior work, we are testing a completely new methodology which we call Advice-Based-Learning (ABLe). By developing ABLe, our team aims to establish an innovative, collaborative cycle between machine-learning and physician expertise. We propose to test the hypothesis that this cycle will increase accuracy beyond what either the machine or human can accomplish alone. Specifically, we hypothesize first that a conventionally-trained graphical model trained with conventional machine learning first algorithms can accurately predict the risk of breast cancer after core biopsy and perform better than current clinical practice; a critical aim that is favorably foreshadowed by our new preliminary data but is labor intensive because we must perfect our unique clinical data that accurately represents clinical experience. Second, a graphical model trained using ABLe can incorporate multi-relational data with physician expertise and significantly improve the predictive accuracy over conventionally trained graphical models and current clinical practice. Third, our best graphical model trained with ABLe will accurately estimate the probability of malignancy after breast biopsy on new clinical cases better than physicians alone resulting in a tool that has the potential to improve care.       Our clinical application is as compelling as our algorithmic work. Image-guided core needle biopsy of the breast is a common procedure that is imperfect, has high-stakes, and is particularly amenable to improvement with automated decision support. Breast core biopsy, the standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis, can be ""non-definitive"" in 5-15% of women undergoing this procedure. This means that between 35,000-105,000 women will require additional biopsies or radiologic follow-up to cement a diagnosis and risk the possibility of missed breast cancers, delays in diagnosis, and unnecessary surgeries. This important problem is emblematic of a plethora of clinical situations where rigorous and accurate risk estimation of rare events provides the opportunity for automated decisions support tools to personalize and strategically target health care interventions to improve decision-making for health-care providers and patients. This award will enable us not only to produce graphical models that provide improved decision support in the breast cancer clinic, but also, and more significantly, to develop a methodology that integrates heterogeneous predictive data and physician knowledge within a graphical model, thereby developing and validating a new algorithmic paradigm for creating accurate, comprehensible, adaptable decision support tools well-suited for clinical translation.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.        n/a",A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis,7917187,K07CA114181,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Wisconsin', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'skills', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K07,2010,140940,338121506,0.05927419629634228
"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           n/a",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7776970,R01CA127379,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Boxing', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Abnormalities', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'relational database', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2010,277409,338121506,0.06426798035795231
"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system.

An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3].

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support.

Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.        n/a",A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis,7677359,K07CA114181,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Probability Theory', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Wisconsin', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'skills', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,K07,2009,140940,338121506,0.05927419629634228
"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           n/a",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7579830,R01CA127379,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Boxing', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Abnormalities', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2009,276161,338121506,0.06426798035795231

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,178185562,0.05854454987332386
"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA.

"Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurate breast cancer screening demands that radiologists maintain a balance of high sensitivity and high specificity when interpreting mammography. Subspecialty-trained breast imagers perform significantly better than general radiologists by recognizing more breast cancers and minimizing benign biopsies. An automated reasoning system called a Bayesian network (BN), has the potential to improve the performance of general radiologists, who interpret the majority of mammograms, to the level of subspecialty-trained breast radiologists, who are in short supply. A BN is a probabilistic graphical model that has been used for decision support in a variety of domains, including radiology. Machine learning provides an appealing way to create and optimize BNs to perform at high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Our research group has developed a prototype, expert-defined BN that uses imaging features and demographic risk factors to classify abnormalities on mammograms as benign or malignant. Our BN can perform at a higher level than general radiologists, but our goal is for it to perform as well or better than subspecialty-trained breast radiologists. To this end, we have compiled a structured, multi-relational dataset of mammography abnormalities and pathologic outcomes from which cutting edge machine learning techniques can construct an improved BN. In the past, BNs were trained and tested on individual abnormalities in isolation. In fact, other abnormalities on the same mammogram or previous mammograms, which necessarily appear in other rows of a relational database, can further improve BN learning. We have used basic statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques to enhance Bayesian learning algorithms to leverage this important additional data. A novel SRL capability introduced by our team within the last year, called view learning, makes it possible to incorporate this related data from other parts of the database by automatically defining new database fields. In our preliminary work, we have shown a stepwise improvement in BN performance: first, with conventional BN learning; then, with basic SRL; and finally, with view learning. We now seek support to determine whether more tightly integrated SRL and view learning will significantly improve our BN's ability to accurately diagnose breast cancer. In addition, we propose to investigate whether two other promising machine learning techniques, predicate-invention and collective-classification, can optimize the BN to perform at levels significantly better than current clinical practice.           n/a",Machine Learning for Improved Mammography Screening,7406091,R01CA127379,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Boxing', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Foundations', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Abnormalities', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'data mining', 'experience', 'human subject', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,272311,338121506,0.06426798035795231
"New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this project we hypothesize that a comprehensive clinical case library with intelligent agents can sort and render clinically similar cases and present clinically significant features, to assist the radiologist in interpreting mammograms. This computer library system is designed to integrate, search, and analyze clinical data that are analogous to the study case. In normal clinical practice, experienced radiologists often refer to their personal mental images of previous proven cases in making diagnoses and patient management decisions.  Providing a computerized library can refresh a radiologist's mental memory with a broad array of proven cases and concrete visualizations. The system can also assist less experienced radiologists in making diagnoses by referring them not only to histologically proven cases but also to the statistical distribution of features. Freed from bias induced by their recent experience, radiologists can use such a library system to improve the diagnostic accuracy at large. This approach differs greatly from conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods. One can also expect that by adding the radiologist's guidance - for example BI-RADS descriptors - into the proposed mammographic library system will lead to increase the searching accuracy and achieve a greater diagnostic outcome.  Technically speaking, this project differs from previous mammographic CADx and image-based retrieval methods in its emphasis on using local vector features and sector fuzzy features of the mammographic masses supported by our newly-invented maximum likelihood fuzzy shadow techniques and multiple circular path convolution neural network. In addition, the recent technical advances in image retrieval using the fuzzy feature matching method and hyper-space analysis techniques have made the success of the proposed approach highly possible.  This computer-based library system can be extended to include other imaging modalities for breast care.  It is conceivable that this comprehensive breast care database can further link local breast care centers through the coming high-speed network system. In addition, this system could also serve as a learning center for clinicians and scientists.

"Three-Class ROC Analysis for Task-Based Medical Image Quality Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Conventional ROC analysis has been widely accepted as a standard in the assessment of diagnostic techniques for binary diagnoses. Many medical diagnoses, however, involve multiple diagnostic alternatives. Examples are breast cancer diagnosis using mammography, where the diagnostic classes are normal, benign, or malignant tumor, and cardiac disease diagnosis using myocardial perfusion SPECT (MRS), where the classes are normal, reversible or fixed defect. To assess multi-class diagnostic techniques, multi-class ROC is required, but has remained an unsolved problem ever since the introduction of binary ROC analysis in the 1950s. Sparked by a practical challenge raised by MPS optimization, the candidate proposed a three- class ROC analysis method that extends and unifies the decision theoretic, linear discriminant analysis and probabilistic foundations of binary ROC in a three-class paradigm. She has conducted five preliminary studies on three-class ROC analysis: (1) deriving its decision model [He, Metz, et.al IEEE Trans Med Imag (TMI) vol. 25(5), 2006]; (2) investigating its decision theoretic foundation [He and Frey, TMI, vol. 25(8), 2006]; (3) exploring its linear discriminant analysis (LDA) foundation [He and Frey, TMI, in press, 2006]; (4) establishing its probabilistic foundation; and (5) comparing it with conventional three-class LDA and revealing the limitations of conventional three-class LDA. The candidate obtained a PhD in Biomedical Engineering in December 2005 and had intensive training on medical imaging. She increased her interest in medical image quality assessment during the development of three-class ROC analysis; her knowledge of the statistics and decision theory principals used in this research is self-taught.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,16827427,0.03775731403646243

"CAD in Breast MRI based on Biological Neural Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Standard techniques used in CAD for breast MRI are based on supervised artificial neural networks and have shown unsatisfactory discriminative results and limited application capabilities. The major disadvantages associated with these techniques are:  (1) requirement of a fixed MR imaging protocol, (2) difficulties in diagnosing small breast masses with a diameter of only a few mm, (3) incapacity of capturing the lesion structure, and (4) training limitations due to an inhomogeneous lesions data pool. To overcome the above mentioned problems, the theme of this research plan becomes to employ biological neural networks which focus strictly on the observed complete MRI signal time-series, and enable a self-organized data-driven segmentation of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI time-series w.r.t. fine-grained differences of signal amplitude, and dynamics, such as focal enhancement in patients with indeterminate breast lesions. The goal of the present project is to improve in an interdisciplinary framework the diagnostic quality in breast MRI. Specifically, the objectives of this proposed project are to:  (1) develop, evaluate and test novel neural network techniques for functional and structural segmentation, visualization, and classification of dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI data, and thus, (2) substantially contribute to breast cancer diagnosis by improved further evaluation of suspicious lesions detected by conventional X-ray mammography. The PI is an electrical and computer engineer with a background in pattern recognition who has been developing new classification methods derived from the newest biological discoveries aiming to imitate decision-making, and sensory processing in biological systems. This Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award will permit the PI to acquire training in cancer research techniques and in computer assisted radiology, and to use these skills to extend and productively apply these new theoretical tools to biomedical applications. Accordingly, the long-term career goal of the PI is to become an effective researcher in the biomedical applications of pattern recognition, with specific emphasis in computer-aided diagnosis.

"A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests K07 support for Dr. Elizabeth Burnside to become an independent investigator and leader in the use of computer models to improve the early detection of breast cancer. This award will allow Dr. Burnside to optimize and validate a computer model called a Bayesian network designed to provide decision-support for radiologists interpreting mammography. This project is a multidisciplinary effort integrating computer science, applied medical informatics, population health science and breast imaging. The University of Wisconsin is an ideal environment for this work because it provides access to renowned researchers in these areas and individuals experienced with the inclusion of diverse populations in women's health research. To achieve these research and career goals, the candidate will follow a career development plan that consists of 1) acquisition of advanced research competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, probability theory, Bayesian reasoning, research ethics, and clinical trial design; 2) mentorship from nationally and internationally recognized experts; and 3) innovative research in computer-aided decision support in breast cancer diagnosis. The current state of breast cancer screening reveals a wide variability of practice and a shortage of expert mammographers. Dr. Burnside's model envisions using expert knowledge to improve non- expert performance in mammography. The model complements current computer-assisted detection algorithms by contributing information to crucial post-discovery aspects of mammography: interpretation and decision-making. Using probability theory, the model defines relationships between a patient's demographic risk factors, her mammographic findings, and diseases of the breast to generate a breast cancer risk assessment uniquely tailored to her. If successful, the model will improve the accuracy of decision-making, decrease the human costs of underperformance and variability, and deliver personalized medicine to patients who undergo mammography.        n/a",A computer model to improve breast cancer diagnosis,7146612,K07CA114181,"['breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'breast neoplasms', 'career', 'clinical research', 'computer simulation', 'computers', 'decision making', 'health science profession', 'human', 'learning', 'mammary gland', 'mammography', 'model', 'performance', 'radiology', 'university']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,K07,2006,140592,0,0.05927419629634228
"Reducing Benign Breast Biopsies with Computer Modeling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The primary objective of this project is to improve the diagnosis of breast cancer and reduce unnecessary benign breast biopsies. An artificial neural network computer-aided 'advisor' will be constructed to assist radiologists in deciding which solid breast masses warrant immediate biopsy and which can be safely observed. Up to 80% of breast biopsies result in a benign diagnosis because benign and malignant masses often appear similar at mammography and sonography. We have previously developed computer models - artificial neural networks - for predicting breast cancer based on mammogram features and the patient's medical history. Models built with only mammography findings and the patient's age demonstrate good preliminary results, potentially eliminating 22% of benign biopsies while identifying all cancers. The principal innovative features of this project are: (1) the focus on solid breast masses by incorporating high-resolution ultrasound features, and (2) the use of a novel, standardized lexicon devised by the American College of Radiology for describing breast ultrasound findings. The goal of the proposed project is to maintain near perfect sensitivity (>98%) - similar to the accuracy of the present clinical practice of short-interval follow-up for 'probably benign' lesions - while theoretically reducing the number of biopsies of benign breast masses by half. Mammogram and ultrasound features will be established for a large retrospective database of approximately 1000 biopsy-proven cases. Artificial neural networks will be constructed with 'supervised' training to predict which masses are very likely benign and which are suspicious for malignancy. The computer predictive models will be tested on a prospective validation database of approximately 1350 cases with known biopsy results. Performance will be evaluated in terms of fraction of benign biopsies avoided while maintaining greater than 98% sensitivity. An interobserver variability study will determine whether the computer model reduces interpretation error and inconsistency between observers.

"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,570146095,0.031840592917862835

"Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The purpose of this study is to increase        the specificity of breast biopsy by building computer models which combine both      mammography and breast ultrasound (US) findings to identify probably benign          breast masses. In current clinical practice, breast US is used only to               distinguish between fluid-filled cysts vs. solid masses. The proposed                artificial neural network (ANN) model would go one step further and                  quantitatively identify probably benign cases which may undergo short-term           follow-up in lieu of biopsy. The hypothesis is that by combining information         from both modalities, the model will be more robust and more accurate than           those based upon either modality alone, and be able to improve upon the              performance of the radiologists.                                                                                                                                          In preliminary studies, ANN models successfully identified probably benign           breast masses using just mammographic findings or just US findings.                                                                                                       The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1. Prospectively collect data        for 300 cases of biopsy-proven breast lesions for which mammography and              ultrasound (US) data are both available. 2. Optimize artificial neural network       (ANN) models to identify probably lesions based on US findings only. 3. Develop      unified models to identify probably benign lesions using both US and                 mammography findings. 4. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate contribution       of US findings to the diagnostic performances of radiologists and ANN models.                                                                                             The immediate benefit of this proposal is a computer-based decision aid to           improve the specificity of breast biopsy and thus reduce the cost associated         with benign biopsies. This proposal has the potential to reduce significantly        the number of unnecessary breast biopsies and their associated cost, physical        pain, and emotional distress to the patient.                                                                                                                              n/a",Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography,6620433,R21CA093461,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human data', ' mammography', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' ultrasonography', "" women's health""]",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2003,154000,607172798,0.024868344803260743

Assuming performance approaching that of the preliminary model, a decision aid based on this model will be ready for prospective clinical trials at the conclusion of this project. n/a",Reducing Benign Breast Biopsies with Computer Modeling,6572250,R01CA095061,"['artificial intelligence', ' biopsy', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' model design /development', ' patient oriented research', "" women's health""]",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,256025,607172798,0.030676166994801635
"Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The principal aim of this proposal is for Talisman to develop, implement and evaluate a computerized, integrated system for processing blood donors that incorporates a series of decision aids and decision algorithms.  The system is expected to significantly reduce donor and staff errors and omissions, increase blood availability, improve staff efficiency and have substantial commercial appeal to blood centers and blood collecting hospitals.      The secondary aim of the proposal is for Talisman to continue assessment of the effectiveness of its computer-assisted, audio-video donor health history self interviewing system, QDS, in reducing donor lying on sexual and other sensitive questions, increasing the frequency of donor returns, reducing staff errors and omissions, and increasing staff efficiency.         n/a",Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making,6728674,R44HL072635,"['artificial intelligence', ' blood bank /supply contamination', ' blood donor', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' human subject', ' interview', ' patient safety /medical error', ' phlebotomy']",NHLBI,"TALISMAN, LTD",R44,2003,514079,0,0.06474135779913373
"Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): The purpose of this study is to increase        the specificity of breast biopsy by building computer models which combine both      mammography and breast ultrasound (US) findings to identify probably benign          breast masses. In current clinical practice, breast US is used only to               distinguish between fluid-filled cysts vs. solid masses. The proposed                artificial neural network (ANN) model would go one step further and                  quantitatively identify probably benign cases which may undergo short-term           follow-up in lieu of biopsy. The hypothesis is that by combining information         from both modalities, the model will be more robust and more accurate than           those based upon either modality alone, and be able to improve upon the              performance of the radiologists.                                                                                                                                          In preliminary studies, ANN models successfully identified probably benign           breast masses using just mammographic findings or just US findings.                                                                                                       The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1. Prospectively collect data        for 300 cases of biopsy-proven breast lesions for which mammography and              ultrasound (US) data are both available. 2. Optimize artificial neural network       (ANN) models to identify probably lesions based on US findings only. 3. Develop      unified models to identify probably benign lesions using both US and                 mammography findings. 4. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate contribution       of US findings to the diagnostic performances of radiologists and ANN models.                                                                                             The immediate benefit of this proposal is a computer-based decision aid to           improve the specificity of breast biopsy and thus reduce the cost associated         with benign biopsies. This proposal has the potential to reduce significantly        the number of unnecessary breast biopsies and their associated cost, physical        pain, and emotional distress to the patient.                                                                                                                              n/a",Predicting breast cancer with ultrasound and mammography,6417326,R21CA093461,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human data', ' mammography', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' ultrasonography', "" women's health""]",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2002,154000,607172798,0.024868344803260743
"DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER Many primary care physicians are unable to proficiently triage skin lesions suspicious for cancer, compromising patients' health. Decision support software could help in the early detection of skin cancer, decreasing morbidity and mortality related to skin cancer misdiagnoses. It also could reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists, lowering health care costs. In Phase I, we demonstrated that decision support software can significantly improve physicians' ability to arrive at appropriate triage decisions for a variety skin lesions, including cancerous lesions. In Phase II, we propose to l) expand the decision support software to triage for pigmented lesions and a wider range of nonpigmented skin lesions; 2) incorporate case-based reasoning methods into the software to enable users to conduct a confidence check on their final triage decision and to help them make the correct decision at each branch point in the decision tree; 3) develop a teaching application based on the decision tree; 4) enable the software to produce for patients individualized information on skin cancer prevention and treatment; 5) interface the decision support software with the computerized patient medical record; and 6) test the effectiveness, utility, and feasibility of the decision support software with a sample of primary care physicians and patients. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research is designed to produce comprehensive decision support software that will be a commercially viable product. Two large potential markets for this product are medical schools, which may use the software as a teaching aid, and medical settings, which may use the software as a clinical tool for practicing primary care physicians.  n/a",DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER,6172710,R44CA075906,"['cancer information system', ' cancer prevention', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' medical records', ' melanoma', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy', ' pigments', ' skin neoplasms']",NCI,WEST PORTAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R44,2000,329958,0,0.07692701857900484
