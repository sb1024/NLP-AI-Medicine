"Biomarkers of Long-Term Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors Treated with Radiation PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Ms. Vasbinder, a second year doctoral student at the University of Washington, and prepare her for a post-doctoral position. The long- term goal of this training is for this applicant to develop into an independent researcher in an intensive academic setting with a program of research focused on translational research to integrate biomarkers in bio-behavioral interventions to reduce and ameliorate symptoms in breast cancer survivors, particularly fatigue. Due to improvements in cancer treatments, survival rates have improved and, as such, there are an estimated 3.5 million breast cancer survivors as of 2016. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in cancer survivors. Radiation, a major contributor of fatigue, produces fatigue in 80% of survivors acutely and 33% of survivors long-term. Radiation is hypothesized to cause fatigue through pathways of inflammation; however, the mechanisms driving long-term fatigue (LTF) after treatment has ceased, is less clear. For breast cancer survivors, radiation can also cause reductions in heart function, which can produce LTF. Evidence also supports the role of oxidative stress in LTF. Given multiple pathways are likely involved in LTF in patients receiving radiation, biomarkers targeting different mechanisms may provide greater insight into the mechanisms leading to LTF and future interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-OH-dG), cardiac damage (cystatin-C), and inflammation (IL-6, CRP) in the development of LTF in cancer survivors diagnosed with breast cancer treated with radiation using the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model (NIH-SSM). Methods: We propose to leverage a matched, case-control design using serum samples from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC). Women will be eligible if they meet the following criteria: 1) enrolled in LILAC, 2) have serum samples available at both WHI baseline and year 3, 3) breast cancer diagnosis and treatment between the two serum sample collection time points, and 4) fatigue measured at least 6 months from cancer treatment completion end date. Fatigue will be defined as scoring < 50 and “non-fatigued” defined as scoring ³ 50 measured using the Short-Form 36 Vitality subscale (SF-36). We anticipate having 150 fatigue cases and 150 non-fatigued controls. Serum biomarkers (cystatin-C, 8-OH-dG, IL-6, and CRP) will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at WHI baseline and year 3 of the WHI. Weighted sampling logistic regression models and mediation analyses will be used to test study aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms experienced by breast cancer survivors, with radiation treatment being a substantial contributor. While inflammatory biomarkers are most often cited as associated with fatigue, biomarkers of oxidative stress and cardiac damage may be especially crucial to consider in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation given the proximity to the heart and physiologic effects of radiation. A better understanding of the physiologic underpinnings of fatigue in breast cancer survivors can lead reductions in fatigue through better prediction models and the development of interventions to target the specific physiologic pathways.",Biomarkers of Long-Term Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors Treated with Radiation,9964505,F31NR018588,"['8-hydroxy-2&apos', '-deoxyguanosine', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'EFRAC', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Survivors', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-36', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Side', 'Specimen', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'biobehavior', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'exercise intolerance', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart damage', 'heart function', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'post gamma-globulins', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiation effect', 'reduce symptoms', 'sample collection', 'symptom science', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,44602,533302350,0.10106642748734225
"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9936304,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2020,45234,340417756,0.00805303816576319
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10263513,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,90342,90419233,0.022755015543936174
"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered nearly every facet of daily life. Although social and physical distancing constraints appear to be slowing the spread of the disease, they may be adversely affecting cancer- related preventive behaviors and accessibility to medical services, including cancer treatment. The impact of such COVID-19 restrictions must be quantified to understand and mitigate short- and long-term effects across the cancer continuum, especially among vulnerable populations, including American Indian adults. The goal of this study is to explore how differences in demographics (e.g., age, sex, educational attainment) may impact engagement in cancer preventive behaviors (e.g., tobacco cessation, cancer screening) and cancer management/survivorship behaviors (e.g., access to cancer treatment services) in the context of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g., social distancing, alterations in work arrangements) by surveying a sample of 1,000 American Indian adults, including those who have never had cancer, cancer patients and cancer survivors. This study will be conducted by the Stephenson Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) program in close coordination with three American Indian tribal nations, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Chickasaw Nation, and Cherokee Nation, and the Oklahoma Area Tribal Epidemiology Center. This goal will be achieved by completing three specific aims: (1) to develop and administer a survey exploring the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cancer prevention and control behaviors. This survey will include a core set of common data elements that will be administered by several NCI-designated Cancer Centers to increase the depth and generalizability of findings; (2) to develop an accurate and robust data integration method using novel machine learning and propensity score weighting approaches to improve the representativeness of the sample of American Indian adults that will be drawn in Oklahoma; and (3) to analyze data to inform tribes, healthcare delivery systems serving American Indian patients, and Stephenson Cancer Center research program members and clinicians regarding how American Indian adults are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will be used to inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the cancer-relevant effects of COVID-19 restrictions in a highly vulnerable group residing within the Stephenson Cancer Center catchment area of Oklahoma. Future iterations of the survey to monitor trends over time are planned. A timeline of COVID-19 related guidance, restrictions or regulatory mandates that have been enacted at the national, state and tribal levels will be constructed to form a context that will allow for meaningful interpretation of findings by tribal community leaders and researchers. The impact of COVID-19 social and physical distancing restrictions on cancer preventive behaviors and access to healthcare, including cancer treatment, must be quantified to understand and mitigate effects of these restrictions on vulnerable groups. The exclusive focus of this study on American Indian adults with and without cancer will provide needed information in a population that may be especially vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant,10149784,P30CA225520,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Center Support Grant', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cherokee Indian', 'Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma', 'Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Community Surveys', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Occupations', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Probability Samples', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Distance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Time trend', 'TimeLine', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tribes', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'college', 'data integration', 'demographics', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment services', 'tribal Nation', 'tribal community', 'tribal health', 'urban residence']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,P30,2020,145000,69391728,0.04462582599857724
"Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening and Surveillance in Community Practice - Admin Supplement for P3 PROJECT SUMMARY This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA- 20-038. The goals of this supplement are to advance progress toward implementing risk-based imaging surveillance for breast cancer in clinical practice. We propose to improve methodological approaches for developing risk models for breast cancer imaging surveillance outcomes, including surveillance detected second breast cancer (benefit) and interval invasive breast cancer (failure), and inform the development of an optimal risk-based imaging surveillance strategy for individual women with primary breast cancer. This proposal builds on the resources of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) from more than 60,000 women with a personal history of breast cancer and more than 330,000 surveillance mammography examinations. The investigators will leverage modern data-adaptive modeling approaches, specifically regularized regression models and machine learning methods which can potentially enhance prediction accuracy, to develop risk models of surveillance outcomes (Aim 1). The investigators propose a comprehensive internal validation with multiple metrics to evaluate the risk models developed via alternative methods for a full understanding of their utilities and trade-offs between models in improving breast cancer survivorship while maintaining clinical usability and interpretability (Aim 2.1). Specifically, the investigators will evaluate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration of each risk model developed in Aim 1, and conduct comparison across models using net reclassification improvement and variable importance measures. Additionally, an online tutorial created using R Markdown is proposed to accelerate uptake of best practices for modern risk model development and validation in other cancers (Aim 2.2). The evaluation and dissemination of alternative methodological modeling approaches in this supplement will directly inform development of risk-stratified surveillance algorithms in breast and other cancer types. PROJECT RELEVANCE This proposal, combined with work funded under the parent award to model surveillance failure using conventional logistic regression, will accelerate the pace of progress toward generating evidence for risk- guided surveillance strategies, including imaging modalities and follow-up frequencies, tailored for each woman with primary breast cancer. In addition, the proposed methodological investigation of alternative data- adaptive risk modeling approaches is applicable to multiple other cancers. Evaluating the impact of alternative modeling approaches in improving predictive accuracy and comparing trade-offs across modeling approaches will guide more rigorous, thoughtful, and accurate prediction model development to guide clinical decisions about cumulative risk of post-treatment outcomes over time, as well as decisions regarding the frequency of surveillance based on recurrence risk.",Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening and Surveillance in Community Practice - Admin Supplement for P3,10164432,P01CA154292,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium', 'Breast Cancer survivorship', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Community Practice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model development', 'online tutorial', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,P01,2020,149977,254622553,0.0899419977080401
"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,9953579,K01HL152009,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical care', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'social', 'survivorship', 'young adult', 'young cancer survivor']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2020,156336,367414121,0.13538817046779525

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,511185245,0.04956761152199282
"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9850957,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,210481,111231681,0.030225241393375693
"Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer Project Summary/Abstract This is an application for a K08 Award to Dr Jennifer Caswell-Jin, an Instructor and breast oncologist at Stanford University establishing a career in translational breast cancer genomic research. The Award will support her career development by providing training in clinical trials, biomarker development, and bioinformatic analysis of multi-omic data under the expert mentorship of Dr Christina Curtis, computational and cancer systems biologist, and Dr George Sledge, breast cancer clinical trialist and translational researcher. The proposed research focuses on the major public health problem of metastatic breast cancer, estimated to affect over 150,000 women and to cause over 40,000 deaths each year in the United States. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most common subtype. Eight “integrative” subtypes of HR+ breast cancer have been identified based on the integration of genome-wide copy number and expression information in early-stage breast tumors. Four integrative subtypes, together comprising one-quarter of all HR+ early-stage breast cancers, exhibit a very high risk of distant metastasis; each of these subtypes is characterized by a distinct area of the genome that exhibits concomitant copy number gain and overexpression. The studies in this proposal will examine for the first time how integrative subtypes behave after metastasis, with the driving hypothesis that they may derive benefit from personalized therapeutic approaches. Aim 1 is to investigate the biology and impact of integrative subtypes in metastatic HR+ breast cancer. We will develop novel approaches to assess integrative subtypes and will learn whether they change across metastasis, whether they are associated with timing of metastasis, and whether they have differential lengths of response to standard therapies. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effects of a novel combination of targeted therapy in two integrative subtypes of metastatic breast cancer. We will perform a clinical trial that tests a targeted therapeutic approach in tumors classifying as one of two of the four high-risk integrative subtypes. Because these two subtypes are defined by focal areas of genomic alteration involving either the fibroblast growth factor receptor ligand (FGF3; integrative subtype 2) or the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1; integrative subtype 6), we hypothesize that these tumors may benefit from FGFR inhibition. Participants in this trial will receive standard endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6 inhibition, as well as an investigational agent that inhibits the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway. We will also perform tumor biopsies before and during treatment to evaluate for changes that occur with this combination targeted therapy approach. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lay the groundwork for continued efforts to develop a precision oncology approach for metastatic HR+ breast cancer, with next steps to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K08 Award. Project Narrative Metastatic breast cancer, of which hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common, is estimated to affect approximately 150,000 women in the United States; most of these women will die of breast cancer, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among women. This proposal will examine distinct molecular categories of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer to understand whether different treatments may affect these groups differently. The knowledge gained will lay the groundwork for a personalized approach to therapy for metastatic breast cancer to improve health and lengthen life.",Integrative subtyping to improve therapeutic options for metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,10039551,K08CA252457,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'CCND1 gene', 'CDK4 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant Metastasis', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Exhibits', 'FGF19 gene', 'FGF3 gene', 'FGFR1 gene', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Situ', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Ib Clinical Trial', 'Plasma', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'breast cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'instructor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized therapeutic', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'whole genome']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,225518,560644462,0.10386188962588638
"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,9995306,R21AG064875,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Arthralgia', 'Attention', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Center', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Estrogens', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Tamoxifen', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Vasomotor', 'Woman', 'adjuvant endocrine therapy', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'older patient', 'older women', 'pill', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2020,234000,122662885,0.08099877635808699
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND PROGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER,10168918,R00CA218667,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'TNM', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contrast enhanced', 'effective therapy', 'feature extraction', 'genetic predictors', 'genomic predictors', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'oncotype', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient stratification', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2020,248999,175892898,0.10058418179697176
"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,9974496,K08CA241365,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Histopathology', 'Hormone Receptor', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Slide', 'Surveillance Program', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer invasiveness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'hormone therapy', 'image guided', 'improved outcome', 'intelligent algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'overtreatment', 'patient health information', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'professor', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'standard care', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2020,259979,551214295,0.03100077686722897
"Biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac damage as markers of long-term radiation-induced cardiovascular outcomes in breast cancer Background: Survival rates from breast cancer have improved; however, many breast cancer survivors experience treatment-induced adverse effects including late-onset cardiovascular disease due to radiation therapy. Radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD), which can appear 5 – 10 or more years after radiation, is a substantial cause of increased morbidity and mortality among breast cancer survivors. Currently, it is not known how to best identify individuals who will develop RICVD, as RICVD often occurs years after treatment and is often neglected in research due to the expense of following participants long-term. As a result, the primary body of literature in cardio-oncology examines short-term cardiac outcomes, mainly related to chemotherapy. Based on these studies, biomarkers of cardiac damage and inflammation have been identified as acute contributors of cardiotoxicity. While RICVD likely shares some pathways of chemotherapy-induced CVD, this has not been definitively tested in research studies. Pathways, such as oxidative stress and fibrosis, are thought to play a large role in the development of RICVD. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine post-treatment serum biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-OH-dG, MPO), fibrosis (TGF-B), cardiac damage (TnI-I, cystatin-C), and inflammation (IL-6, GDF-15, CRP) in the development of long-term RICVD in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation and to stratify by right- vs. left-sided radiation. Specifically, we aim to 1) to examine the risk of RICVD and CVD death in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation (vs. controls) associated with biomarkers (post-treatment), 2) to examine the risk of RICVD and CVD death (vs. controls) comparing breast cancer survivors treated with right-sided radiation vs. left-sided radiation, and 3) to examine the association of post-treatment biomarkers in the risk of RICVD and CVD death (vs. controls) among breast cancer survivors, stratified by right- vs. left-sided radiation. Methods: We propose a nested, case-control design within the Women's Health Initiative Life and Longevity After Cancer (WHI LILAC), a national, prospective, cohort study. Inclusion criteria are: 1) serum sample available at WHI baseline and year 3 and 2) a breast cancer diagnosis and radiation treatment between the two serum collection time points. All biomarkers will be assessed at both timepoints using ELISA. Women with an adjudicated heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary coronary heart disease, or other cardiovascular death outcome occurring post-breast cancer will constitute the case group (n = 56) while women without a RICVD outcome will constitute the control group (n = 128). Logistic regression will be used. Summary: This study leverages the WHI dataset, which is an excellent cohort to address the identified research gaps, given the availability of biospecimens previously collected from participants with nearly 20 years of outcome follow-up. This study is significant as it will investigate biomarkers targeting multiple, relevant pathways potentially associated with RICVD, which could be used in future studies to improve the identification and prediction of RICVD in cancer survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Survival rates from breast cancer have improved; however, many breast cancer survivors experience long-term treatment-induced adverse effects including radiation-induced cardiovascular disease (RICVD). The proposed study is significant as it will investigate biomarkers targeting multiple, relevant pathways associated with the long-term changes likely to occur with RICVD, which could be used to improve the identification and prediction of RICVD in cancer survivors. This line of work could lead to reductions in RICVD risk by targeting interventions to those at highest risk, such as increasing surveillance or introduction of cardioprotective medications.","Biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac damage as markers of long-term radiation-induced cardiovascular outcomes in breast cancer",9952038,R21HL152149,"['8-hydroxy-2&apos', '-deoxyguanosine', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'GDF15 gene', 'Handedness', 'Heart', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocarditis', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pericardial body location', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Side', 'Specimen', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Translating', 'Troponin I', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cardioprotection', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'case control', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'post gamma-globulins', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiation risk', 'research study', 'risk prediction model', 'targeted biomarker']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,291393,533302350,0.09557907610344406
"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,9878491,R21CA234752,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chest', 'Childhood Cancer Survivor Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Contralateral Breast', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Late Effects', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Induced Cancer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Factor', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological systems', 'cancer genetics', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental radiation', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'proton therapy', 'radiation risk', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2020,293870,185946435,0.0891924648425
"Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer ABSTRACT Cervical cancer affects the lives of half a million women worldwide each year. Over half of these women die, even though cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination or early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical pre-cancer. Cervical cancer prevention consists of three visits in the U.S.: 1) screening using the Papanicolaou smear; 2) colposcopy followed by biopsy of cervical abnormalities for women with positive screening results; 3) treatment by excising the lesion using a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) for women with cervical pre-cancer. This three-visit model is not practical for use in medically underserved regions due to the technologies and expertise needed and patient attrition between clinic visits. Our team has already developed a novel Pocket colposcope and machine learning algorithms that when combined provide high-quality, magnified visualization and automated diagnosis with comparable performance to standard-of-care colposcopy. However, screening and diagnosis alone will not lead to decreases in cervical cancer mortality if access to point-of-care treatment is limited. Recently, the thermocoagulator has gained acceptance for ablation of cervical pre-cancer lesions as it does not require consumables (continuous supply of pressurized liquid nitrogen for cryotherapy) or a stable power supply (for LEEP). However, low-cost thermocoagulators have frequent failures based on reports of field-testing and the more reliable versions cost more than $10k. To address these well-documented shortcomings, our group is working to establish a low-cost ablative therapy using a ubiquitous agent, ethanol to treat cervical pre-cancer. While ethanol ablation has a long history of clinical use, its direct injection into tissue leads to non-uniform distribution and hence low efficacy in the region of interest. We propose a new formulation of ethanol using a polymer called ethyl cellulose (generally regarded as safe by the FDA), which will act as a slow release gel without off target toxicity, and an automated injector to control delivery of ethanol-ethyl cellulose (EEC) into the region of interest. The goal of this Phase I SBIR grant is to establish controlled delivery of EEC for cervical pre-cancer treatment using a combination of tissue surrogates and ex vivo and in vivo models of the swine cervix to induce a zone of necrosis that is consistent with thermocoagulation, a commonly used ablation method. In Aim 1, an automated needle injector will be designed for reproducible EEC delivery in tissue surrogates by maximizing the ratio of distributed to injected volume and minimizing back flow and crack formation. In Aim 2, the automated needle injector will be tested in ex vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution of the agent within the defined region of interest and also to determine the number of injections needed to achieve optimal coverage. In Aim 3, the injector safety and efficacy will be tested in in vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution volume and zone of necrosis caused by EEC. The results from the Phase I SBIR will set the foundation for development of alpha and beta versions of the automated needle injector, quality control assessment and packaging of the EEC injectate, and submission of an IND for EEC to the FDA. The goal of this SBIR is for PIs from academic and small business institutions to work in partnership to develop a technological strategy that will transform treatment of cervical pre-cancer in low-resource communities. The proposed research is significantly relevant to public health, as the developed technologies will contribute to the improvement of cervical cancer prevention, and thus a reduction in the mortality rate of this imminently preventable disease.",Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer,10140866,R43CA257303,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cellulose', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cold Therapy', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Ethanol', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Field Reports', 'Fluorescein', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Needles', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Power Sources', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stains', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Vaccination', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'cervical biopsy', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cost', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'field study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preclinical study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'screening', 'standard of care']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R43,2020,300000,300000,0.03315863222276811
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9856147,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,309176,340417756,0.04841400453501537
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients.

"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms Project Summary The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and, therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%) never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus, offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential (≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation. We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT), convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups. Project Narrative There is much controversy surrounding breast cancer screening guidelines, resulting in women making individual choices regarding their screening, in consultation with their physician. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to women as to the benefit of screening mammography for them as an individual. Our research goal is to develop a near-term mammography-detectable breast cancer risk marker using a new image transformation, deep learning, and statistical approach for longitudinal data on serial mammograms that will help women choose their own personalized protocol in consultation with their doctor.",Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms,9940199,R37CA248207,"['Advocate', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radon', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,357994,570146095,0.095967511633846
"Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals ABSTRACT Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people face a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. Although there is a growing body of literature on the unique health issues among TGNC populations, they remain severely underserved as existing data on TGNC health are scarce. Under-reporting is common due to issues related to social and economic marginalization, stigma, and discrimination, leading to challenges in obtaining population-based estimates since TGNC individuals are often unwilling to self-identify and reluctant to participate in traditional surveys. Further, past TGNC research has primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. There is limited data available on age-related chronic conditions such as cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, cancer is one of the top research priorities among the TGNC population. With a rapidly growing aging TGNC population, there is an urgent need to characterize the cancer burden among these individuals and understand how cancer impact them differentially compared to non-TGNC individuals. On the other hand, rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has made longitudinal clinical data available for research. EHRs contain not only important structured data, such as demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but also unstructured clinical narratives such as physician’s notes. More than 80 percent of the clinical information is documented in clinical narratives, which contain more detailed patient information including gender identity and cancer risk factors. Motivated by these observations and built upon our previous studies on 1) the adequacy of TGNC gender identity terms, 2) clinical natural language processing methods for information extraction, and 3) EHR-based cohort studies, we propose to conduct a population-based cohort analysis to examine the cancer burden and risk factors among TGNC people using a unique data source from a large network of EHRs—OneFlorida, one of the 13 PCORI-funded clinical data research networks (CDRNs) contributing to the PCORnet. Using both structured and unstructured OneFlorida data, we will first develop computable phenotypes to identify TGNC individuals and subsequently evaluate their cancer risk. Our research is significant because: 1) no population-based cohort studies on cancer risk have been conducted among the TGNC population. Our results will support the development of tailored, evidence- based cancer screening programs for TGNC people; 2) our research will create a cohort of TGNC people that can be not only tracked longitudinally in EHR but also recruited for future clinical studies; and 3) working with a PCORnet CDRN makes our analysis framework generalizable to the overall PCORNet. Overall, the proposed research will advance our knowledge in cancer among the aging TGNC population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of cancer burden and risk factors in transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people, a sexual and gender minority (SGM) group. A computable phenotype that can accurately identify TGNC cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor TGNC health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as cancer. Built upon this work, our future work can focus on building informatics tools to support the long-term surveillance and health monitoring of SGMs using large-scale national networks of EHRs.",Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals,10056679,R21CA245858,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Burden', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coin', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hormone use', 'Hospitals', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer statistics', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'gender nonconforming', 'health care service organization', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'informatics tool', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population based', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening program', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'stem', 'structured data', 'study population', 'transgender']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,392115,188894159,0.04548918341000189
"Long noncoding RNA regulations in breast cancer among African-American women ABSTRACT Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide, high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype- specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome- wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) African American (AA) women have a higher risk of being diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer and have the highest mortality rate among all racial groups in U.S. women. We will systematically elucidate the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory molecules, in breast cancer prognosis in AA women.

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,377931988,0.03989440153496143
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,10001470,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer cell subtype', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic index', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,422658,157845771,0.1007152008671051
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,9885223,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,447500,327644200,0.02788894372851941
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9940707,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,450262,148463823,0.05033152262850542
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,9866770,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R01,2020,510210,16827427,0.05550372766943849
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,10005895,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,522053,9101010,0.0483598268069091
"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10031384,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,580599,338121506,0.027356730258788382
"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9951006,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncotype', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,598709,197030888,0.044133962528101894
"The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities Women of African heritage suffer a higher breast cancer mortality compared to their European counterparts. Though the biologic basis for these disparities remains poorly defined, recent studies suggest definitive roles for biological variation in the gene expression pathways governing tumor behavior and alterations in the tumor microenvironment. The transcription factor Kaiso (ZBTB33) is a gene regulatory factor, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, that has been functionally linked to racial differences in survival outcome in several epithelial cancers. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to define functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the immmune tumor microenvironment that contribute to racial differences in breast cancer survival. We accomplish this through application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize the Kaiso dependent differences in spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment using multiplex immunofluorescent technologies to profile a unique breast cancer health disparities cohort (Specific Aim One). We then apply this technology to examine the impact of Kaiso disruption on autophagy and the immune tumor microenvironment using a murine orthotopic allograft model for Kaiso depletion in the presence and absence of pharmacologic blockade of autophagy (Specific Aim Two). We then perform a large-scale application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to profile the spatial and topological features of the tumor microenvironment in 901 racially diverse breast cancer specimens by multiplex immunohistochemistry to define the detailed role of Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment in population-specific differences in breast cancer outcome (Specific Aim Three). Together with a closely integrated multi-disciplinary team of breast cancer pathologists, cancer biologists, computer scientists, biostatisticians, bioinformaticians and data scientists, we will define new prognostic and predictive biomarkers that link Kaiso to tumor progression, the immune tumor microenvironment, breast cancer outcome and how their association differs by race. Elevated expression of the multifunctional transcriptional regulator, Kaiso (ZBTB33) is associated with worse breast cancer survival based on race. In this study we leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to study a novel breast cancer health disparities cohort to define new functional linkages between Kaiso, autophagy and the tumor microenvironment that contribute to racially disparate breast cancer outcome.","The linkage between Race, Kaiso and the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer health disparities",10058193,R01CA253368,"['African', 'Allografting', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Computers', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Histopathology', 'Hormone Receptor', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression', 'Implant', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Race', 'Recurrence Score', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Slide', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer progression', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer health disparity', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disparity reduction', 'health disparity', 'hormone receptor-negative', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'inhibition of autophagy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,672210,558628098,0.10132297899738796

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9987569,R01CA229811,"['Age', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cox Models', 'Cytokeratin 8', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Individual', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic Density', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'classification trees', 'cohort', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'senescence', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2020,721306,0,0.06474768247409293
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9979779,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,745481,228951281,0.033373231903285505
"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),9948598,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,797939,111231681,0.04189772232177986
"Developing high-throughput genetic perturbation strategies for single cells in cancer organoids PROJECT SUMMARY  To address the complexity of heterogeneous cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and frequently recur or metastasize, we propose to develop a set of tools based on multidisciplinary innovations combining Synthetic Biology, Cancer Organoid Technology, and Bioinformatics. These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records Summary Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients. These outcomes will increase quality of life and substantially decrease the burden of cancer on society. Narrative  This project aims to provide kits for research scientists and clinicians to make comprehensive surveys of the identities and levels of proteins in blood.

"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets.

"Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools  The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) 2019 symposium hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) identified “a critical need to collect, analyze, and share data to address the burden of cancer in children, adolescents and young adults”. Currently, cancer registries in the U.S. hold structured information on every cancer case, including pediatric cancers, within their respective catchment areas. For childhood cancer patients and survivors, issues of late effects, recurrence, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), and follow-up are critically important to consider and further study. It is also important to address survivors’ life trajectories, which often include moving to different states and away from where their data was initially collected.   The aim of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is to build a connected data infrastructure that includes longitudinal data from multiple sources and enables secure sharing of childhood cancer data with vetted research investigators. These efforts will support childhood cancer research and provide a population-level dataset on all childhood cancer patients. As a base for the infrastructure, data currently collected at targeted cancer registries, including those in the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) program, will be used to aggregate key information on childhood cancer patients and survivors. In addition to registry data, NCCR aims to incorporate unique data sources including the National Death Index (NDI), State vital records, LexisNexis (residential history and social determinants of health data), and Virtual Pooled Registry (VPR) data on subsequent primaries, as well as pharmacy and radiation oncology data. Additional categories of information that may be integrated into the database include detailed diagnostic characterization of the tumor, treatment information, indicators of tumor recurrence, identification of multiple primary cancers, and genomic characterization of initial and potentially recurrent disease.   The Department of Energy (DOE)/Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest multipurpose science laboratory in the DOE national laboratory system. The mission of ORNL is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions to meet pressing global challenges aligned with the DOE’s goals. This “science-to-solutions” mission depends on the integration and application of distinctive capabilities in basic and applied research, which include leadership positions and capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC), advanced visualization and data fusion, and computational science and systems engineering and integration. ORNL is recognized as a leader in the research and development of health and data sciences. In the DOE national laboratory system, ORNL has a highly capable and proven data and computing enclave certified to host and analyze protected health information (PHI). ORNL’s capabilities, certified systems that accommodate PHI, HPC capabilities and facilities, and the technical expertise that has proven successful in a recent multi-year project with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) and its broader engagement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are unmatched in the domestic private sector, making ORNL uniquely qualified to perform the work required for this effort.    With growing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the national cancer surveillance program faces increasing challenges in capturing essential information needed to better understand the effectiveness of cancer treatments in the context of our complex medical and social environment. The capacity to collect automatically and comprehensively information about cancer patients would enhance the ability of cancer registry data to support a broad variety of cancer research and would provide an infrastructure that would permit evaluation of the generalizability of cancer diagnostics and therapies outside the clinical trials setting to the 97%  of the general population not covered by clinical trials. These advances will be important in future healthcare applications beyond cancer, and the knowledge gained will be directly related to technology for future HPC architectures and for making HPC more available to biomedical research.  The Current DOE collaboration with NIH/NCI, known as the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer, has produced several useful tools and documentation which have been utilized by the cancer surveillance community for adult cancer populations. In particular, ORNL has developed deep learning models and modalities of data analytics that are of particular interest to the NCCR. Their expertise and development of various tools using information from multiple data sources can be used to support various data queries, provide assessment of feasibility of developing trials, and enabling comparisons of key characteristics among the entire population of childhood cancer patients at a population level to compare to patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. Children’s Oncology Group [COG]). Furthermore, their expertise and computing capabilities will enable NCI to refine and develop scaling mechanisms of existing data extraction algorithms to obtain data from text documentation in pediatric cancer abstracts that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.    This infrastructure will serve as the central data index and warehouse for childhood cancer data through large-scale data identification and linkages and has the potential to provide real-world evidence to support data-driven clinical guidelines. These developed tools combined with this data infrastructure will also support a broad range of research questions. Through the shared follow-up information across registries and other data linkage sources, annual follow-up data will be greatly enhanced for childhood cancer survivors and pediatric oncology research.  The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding to 1) support the development and refinement of advanced computational tools (e.g., artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, graph analytics, text extraction algorithms, predictive modeling, and other advanced computational methodologies) using key data from the NCCR infrastructure and various other external data sources, and 2) utilize NCCR to further refine existing tools developed by DOE/ORNL. n/a",Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools ,10281416,PC20005001,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Catchment Area', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Late Effects', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Private Sector', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SEER Program', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'computerized tools', 'data fusion', 'data infrastructure', 'data registry', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'large scale data', 'multiple data sources', 'neoplasm registry', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'social health determinants', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,Y01,2020,1000000,0,0.040726375513289385
"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10216917,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2020,4506756,614137041,0.040377791152555284
"Biomarkers of Long-Term Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors Treated with Radiation PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Ms. Vasbinder, a second year doctoral student at the University of Washington, and prepare her for a post-doctoral position. The long- term goal of this training is for this applicant to develop into an independent researcher in an intensive academic setting with a program of research focused on translational research to integrate biomarkers in bio-behavioral interventions to reduce and ameliorate symptoms in breast cancer survivors, particularly fatigue. Due to improvements in cancer treatments, survival rates have improved and, as such, there are an estimated 3.5 million breast cancer survivors as of 2016. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in cancer survivors. Radiation, a major contributor of fatigue, produces fatigue in 80% of survivors acutely and 33% of survivors long-term. Radiation is hypothesized to cause fatigue through pathways of inflammation; however, the mechanisms driving long-term fatigue (LTF) after treatment has ceased, is less clear. For breast cancer survivors, radiation can also cause reductions in heart function, which can produce LTF. Evidence also supports the role of oxidative stress in LTF. Given multiple pathways are likely involved in LTF in patients receiving radiation, biomarkers targeting different mechanisms may provide greater insight into the mechanisms leading to LTF and future interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-OH-dG), cardiac damage (cystatin-C), and inflammation (IL-6, CRP) in the development of LTF in cancer survivors diagnosed with breast cancer treated with radiation using the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model (NIH-SSM). Methods: We propose to leverage a matched, case-control design using serum samples from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Life and Longevity After Cancer (LILAC). Women will be eligible if they meet the following criteria: 1) enrolled in LILAC, 2) have serum samples available at both WHI baseline and year 3, 3) breast cancer diagnosis and treatment between the two serum sample collection time points, and 4) fatigue measured at least 6 months from cancer treatment completion end date. Fatigue will be defined as scoring < 50 and “non-fatigued” defined as scoring ³ 50 measured using the Short-Form 36 Vitality subscale (SF-36). We anticipate having 150 fatigue cases and 150 non-fatigued controls. Serum biomarkers (cystatin-C, 8-OH-dG, IL-6, and CRP) will be measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at WHI baseline and year 3 of the WHI. Weighted sampling logistic regression models and mediation analyses will be used to test study aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms experienced by breast cancer survivors, with radiation treatment being a substantial contributor. While inflammatory biomarkers are most often cited as associated with fatigue, biomarkers of oxidative stress and cardiac damage may be especially crucial to consider in breast cancer survivors treated with radiation given the proximity to the heart and physiologic effects of radiation. A better understanding of the physiologic underpinnings of fatigue in breast cancer survivors can lead reductions in fatigue through better prediction models and the development of interventions to target the specific physiologic pathways.",Biomarkers of Long-Term Fatigue in Breast Cancer Survivors Treated with Radiation,9758471,F31NR018588,"['8-hydroxy-2&apos', '-deoxyguanosine', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'EFRAC', 'Enrollment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Survivors', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SF-36', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Side', 'Specimen', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'biobehavior', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'exercise intolerance', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart damage', 'heart function', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'post gamma-globulins', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiation effect', 'reduce symptoms', 'sample collection', 'symptom science', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapy development']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2019,44098,533302350,0.10106642748734225
"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9806021,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2019,54765,340417756,0.00805303816576319
"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer,9653164,K99CA218667,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'TNM', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contrast enhanced', 'effective therapy', 'genetic predictors', 'genomic predictors', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient stratification', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,160852,560644462,0.10058418179697176
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9720681,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,161230,533594881,0.05033152262850542
"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence. These methods will be used to derive individualized predictive indices of treatment outcomes based on a multimodal imaging dataset of rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative CRT. Our methods are generally applicable to radiomic studies of cancer patients. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader radiomics community.

"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9668002,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,172270,111231681,0.030225241393375693
"Reducing recall rates of screening mammography with deep convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the recent successes of screening mammography, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of death in women aged 45 to 55. This suggests that there is an urgent need to improve the current approaches to breast cancer screening based on mammography. The specificity of the screening mammography is also limited as the continued large fraction of false-positives often leads to unnecessary follow-up procedures including biopsy that cause considerable pain, anxiety and cost. It is therefore necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy of mammography in terms of both sensitivity for early detection of breast cancer and specificity to keep the recall rate 10% or less as recommended by American College of Radiology. In this study, we investigate deep convolutional networks (DCN) for medical imaging by developing from scratch a novel family of DCNs based on the characteristics of medical images and evaluating it on screening mammographic exams. We design a novel, multi-view DCN that will work with a set of multiple views in their original resolution so as to avoid missing crucial micro-structures, opposed to using heavily downscaled images as often done with natural images or by some earlier work on applying DCN to medical images. Unlike most existing works which verify their approaches on a small number of cases, we propose to train and test the proposed networks on a large-scale data consisting of about 500,000 cases collected over the period of five years at our institution. Our preliminary experiments using an initial version of the multi-view deep convolutional network with about 25,000 cases strongly support the need for the proposed large-scale, high- resolution deep learning for early-stage breast cancer screening. We have also collected 201,000 cases of screening mammograms to date and are in the process of annotating the cases based on the available follow- up studies. The overarching goal of this study is to develop, optimize and test a multi-view DCN system that can either independently read a series of screening mammographic exams to identify early breast cancers accurately or to assist a human reader so as to reduce reading time and improve confidence in early breast cancer detection. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening. Aim 2 is to conduct preliminary reader study on the impact of the MV-DCN as a screening exam aid system. The outcome of this study, the multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening and the preliminary assessment of its impact on human readers, will form an important basis on which further investigation into optimizing deep convolution networks for medical imaging can be conducted.

"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,511185245,0.04956761152199282
"Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This proposal presents a five-year career development plan focused on data science and artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of AI to improve outcomes in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The candidate is a Radiologist at MGH and an Assistant Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research and clinical experiences in breast imaging and also upon a strong ongoing research partnership between MGH and MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in academic breast imaging by investigating and applying AI to critical areas in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposed research project and advanced didactic training at Harvard and MIT will position the candidate with a unique set of knowledge and skills in data science and AI that will enable her to develop an independent cancer research program that focuses on applications of AI to breast imaging.  The incidence of DCIS has dramatically increased over the past 40 years, with an estimated 63,960 diagnoses in 2018. Current guidelines recommend that DCIS be treated with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, but there remains considerable controversy over whether this regimen represents overtreatment for those women with indolent non-hazardous DCIS. Given concerns about overtreatment, there are currently three randomized controlled trials underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of active surveillance versus standard treatment, and critical to the implementation of active surveillance programs is careful selection of eligible patients. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust AI tool that incorporates clinical data, mammographic imaging, and biopsy histopathology slides for pre-operatively predicting the risk of concurrent invasive cancer in women with DCIS. The tool will be built using machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Incorporation of mammographic imaging and histopathology slides into the AI tool will be supported by the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS) and the MGH Department of Pathology. After development and validation of the AI tool based on a retrospective cohort of 1,400 women diagnosed with DCIS at MGH, the tool will then be integrated into MGH’s mammography information system and used to categorize new cases of DCIS. The specific aims are: (1) to develop a robust AI tool that predicts the risk of upgrade of DCIS diagnosed by image-guided core needle biopsy to invasive cancer at surgery and (2) to implement and evaluate the AI tool in clinical practice. Use of this tool could identify the subset of women who are appropriate candidates for active surveillance, decrease the morbidity and costs of overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, more than 60,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is also known as noninvasive or Stage 0 breast cancer, and undergo an aggressive treatment regimen involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal therapy. We propose to develop and implement a robust tool, using artificial intelligence, to pre-operatively predict the risk that DCIS will upgrade to invasive cancer at surgery. Development of a highly reliable prognostic tool could identify the subset of women who may not need aggressive treatment, decrease the morbidity and costs associated with overtreatment, and support more targeted and precise treatment options for women diagnosed with DCIS.",Development and Clinical Implementation of an Artificial Intelligence Tool to Predict Risk of Upgrade of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,9806162,K08CA241365,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Histopathology', 'Hormone Receptor', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Slide', 'Surveillance Program', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer invasiveness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'hormone therapy', 'image guided', 'improved outcome', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medical schools', 'overtreatment', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'professor', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'standard care', 'surgery outcome', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2019,259979,551214295,0.03100077686722897
"Molecular Analysis of Residual Breast Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death (PMID: 25651787). According to the WHO, breast cancer incidence rose 20% between 2008 and 2012, with 1.7M global diagnoses in 2012. More than 40,000 women died from breast cancer in the U.S. in 2016. Residual disease is important because breast cancer patients with positive margins have a high risk of recurrence and disease-specific mortality. Some studies indicate a surprisingly high risk from positive margins: patients with positive margins have a higher risk of recurrence than patients who have micrometastases to 10 lymph nodes. The elevated risk from positive margins continues to persist even in an era where lumpectomy patients are treated with radiotherapy and systemic therapies. In fact, the increased risk from positive margins is not reduced by additional chemo or a radiation boost. These findings underscore the continued importance of identifying positive margins, especially when clinical trial data will be used to evaluate emerging therapies or compare treatment efficacies. Improving the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer depends on clinical trials, which must account for confounding clinical variables like residual disease. Evidence-based medicine depends on the quality of the underlying data that are used to evaluate therapeutic options and perform comparative efficacy studies. Unfortunately, existing tests are not reliable enough to accurately and reproducibly detect residual disease. Inaccurate tests contribute to confusion and conflicting trial results. This goal of this project is to establish an improved test for residual breast cancer. This work builds on extensive development and validation of a panel of biomarkers that distinguishes tumors from healthy samples. This project will continue our transition from discovery platforms to a technology that is already widely used in clinical labs. Improved testing would improve clinical trials by identifying high-risk patients, allow researchers to ask fundamental questions about breast cancer treatments, and compare treatment efficacies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Detection of minimal residual disease for liquid tumors has undergone two revolutions: from microscopy to flow cytometry, and then from flow cytometry to nucleic acid tests.

"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9634912,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,299899,340417756,0.04841400453501537
"Identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource community cancer settings using an innovative informatics solution PROJECT SUMMARY . Hereditary cancer risk assessment in low-resource community cancer settings is a signiﬁcant unmet clinical need. Unfortunately, most community cancer clinics do not have adequate access to genetics expertise and patients are not systematically assessed for hereditary risk. New cost-eﬀective and practical approaches are needed to assess and identify patients at risk for hereditary cancer community cancer settings where rural, minority, and underserved patients receive cancer care. ItRunsInMyFamily, Inc and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have partnered to develop ItRunsInMyFamily.com (ItRuns), a simple, scalable informatics tool that uses artiﬁcial intelligence and social networking to collect family health history from patients and assess for hereditary cancer risk. For this project we will develop a functional prototype and demonstrate feasibility of ItRuns as a simple, low-cost approach for identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource, community cancer settings. By successfully achieving the outcomes from this Phase I project, we will have a clear path to develop the technology, expertise, and evidence to make a signiﬁcant impact on hereditary cancer risk assessment in low-resource community cancer settings.

"A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva. Breast cancer screening by mammography is part of routine wellness care for women starting at around age 40 in the United States. 40 million women are screened annually with mammograms to detect the ~250,000 new cases of breast cancer that occur each year. Mammograms still miss 15% of cancers, and sensitivity falls to 45-50% in women with high density breasts, which is more common in younger women. High breast density is itself considered a risk factor for breast cancer (BC), and the FDA has declared managing breast density information a major policy goal for 2018. More women are also now identified as at high risk for breast cancer with commonly available genetic testing. Detection of breast cancer at its earliest, curable stages is precisely when imaged based screening methods are more likely fail. Imaging methods clearly play an important role in early BC detection, providing structural information about the tumor, but are not fail proof, and would benefit from complementary screening tools, especially in cases where imaging is more likely to fail (younger women, high breast density). Precision medicine approaches and liquid biopsies have the potential to transform cancer detection and management. Saliva is a noninvasive biofluid that contains functional biomarkers, including RNA, protein and metabolites. Biomarkers for many diseases have been identified in saliva, including breast cancer. As a screening method, saliva sampling is noninvasive and easy to collect, and compatible with procedures at the point-of-care, such as at breast imaging clinics. To date, saliva based diagnostic efforts have largely been undertaken in academia, without a comprehensive industry-initiated approach for product development and commercialization. In this phase 1 project, “A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva,” we propose to develop the first saliva-based companion screening diagnostic for BC. Our prototype test called CertinaTM was developed by applying our proprietary and novel algorithmic approach to gene expression microarray data from saliva collected from BC patients and has been validated in two separate clinical cohorts. Our initial 9-gene signature has an 83% sensitivity and 90% specificity for invasive BC detection. In this phase 1 project, our objectives are to develop a saliva collection kit optimized for collection of our signature RNA, with room temperature stability for collection and transport, with our partner Oasis Diagnostics, a leader in the field of saliva collection devices; establish a saliva biobank for BC assay validation, partnering with Cancer Research Collaborations in Southern California to collect a wide range of clinical samples for longitudinal studies and for use in assay improvement; assess the accuracy of our signature in early stage breast cancer and in women with dense breasts, as well as improve performance of the CertinaTM assay. Completing these objectives will provide the tools for a Phase II large-scale study, pairing our test with primary screening in breast cancer as the first saliva-based commercial diagnostic for breast cancer. Breast cancer screening by mammography is part of routine wellness care in the US for women over 40, but has detection rates as low as 50% in some groups of women, and a high false positive rate, requiring additional follow up and invasive biopsies to ensure the absence of cancer. A saliva based diagnostic test for breast cancer is proposed here, that has potential for tremendous public health impact to transform and enhance breast cancer screening. The proposed test is a noninvasive, gene expression based test from saliva, which will complement image-based structural information with biological information, improve breast cancer detection, reduce false alarms, and simplify screening workflows. .","A Noninvasive, Precision Medicine Approach to Improve Breast Cancer Screening Using Cell-free RNA from Saliva.",9778292,R43CA232952,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Legal patent', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Noise', 'Non-Malignant', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recontacts', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast density', 'breast imaging', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic screening', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic signature', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical algorithm', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'oncology', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'product development', 'programs', 'protein metabolite', 'prototype', 'routine screening', 'sample collection', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'young woman']",NCI,"PRIME GENOMICS, INC.",R43,2019,300000,0,0.12565544442481394
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients.

"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging Summary The overall aim of this project is to investigate and better understand the repeatability and robustness of radiomics in breast cancer imaging. Radiomics from medical images can provide information about lesion features such as size, irregularity, and texture, which can be used to produce quantitative image-based phenotypes that can assist in diagnosis of cancer and assessment of treatment. Using previously acquired radiomics measurements of breast cancer imaged by full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and magnetic resonance (MR), Aim 1 of this study is to assess their repeatability using three classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Bayesian neural network methods), bootstrapping for variability assessment, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) methods. By doing so, we will be able to evaluate how radiomics may be expected to vary in their output and performance on FFDM and MR. In Aim 2, we endeavor to understand the cross-modality performance of radiomics measurements of lesion cases imaged by both FFDM and MR. This work will provide a new understanding of the robustness of radiomics tumor descriptors compared across two modalities and fulfill a currently unmet need – thus being both novel and significant. Statistical analysis will be conducted using superiority and non-inferiority testing. These studies will provide a better understanding of the repeatability and robustness of radiomics of breast lesion images, an important step in establishing their utility in disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. Project Narrative Breast cancer is a significant public health concern; it is estimated that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Radiomics makes use of quantitative image-based phenotypes, also called features, to provide information about the presence of cancer and its response to treatment, which can aid physicians in medical decision making. The overall objective of this study, addresses a currently unmet need and aims to assess the repeatability of radiomics made from mammography and magnetic resonance images of breast cancer and to determine the robustness of radiomics for lesions imaged across two modalities, mammography and magnetic resonance; the aims of this study are designed to contribute to better understanding of the utility and generalizability of the role of radiomics in cancer patient management and precision medicine.",Assessment of Repeatability and Robustness of Radiomics in Breast Cancer Imaging,9654299,R15CA227948,"['Address', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Bibliography', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Faculty', 'Geography', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Ultrasonography', 'Mammography', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Students', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'college', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,WHEATON COLLEGE,R15,2019,396673,133893,0.06551516597870297
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,9764150,R01CA199996,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gland', 'Global Change', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Microscopy', 'Needles', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Normal Range', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Width', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast surgery', 'cohort', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'milk secretion', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'population health', 'preservation', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'scaffold', 'second harmonic', 'second harmonic generation imaging', 'support network', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,410556,338121506,0.09830739379226712
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9703925,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,431871,570146095,0.028317539072146007
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9920692,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,499903,9101010,0.0483598268069091
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,9784775,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,560831,157845771,0.1007152008671051
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9724401,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585112,197030888,0.044133962528101894
"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9739251,R01CA229811,"['Age', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cox Models', 'Cytokeratin 8', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Individual', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic Density', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'classification trees', 'cohort', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'senescence', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2019,619727,0,0.06474768247409293
"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),9817364,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'demographics', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,674438,111231681,0.04189772232177986
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9749060,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,733691,228951281,0.033373231903285505
"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10047552,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2019,3250000,614137041,0.040377791152555284
"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As a result, genetic counseling and testing is increasingly recommended for AYAs with new cancer diagnoses so that screening for new cancers can take place; however, no AYA-specific models for cancer risk communication and decision-making have been developed.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9648208,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,34680,533594881,0.05033152262850542
"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%). Here, combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging used with a clinically-translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker and novel machine learning based spectral recognition algorithms are explored for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and for intraoperative tumor margin assessment. The project is supported by excellent mentors, Drs. Willmann and Rubin, and a diverse advisory committee, Drs. Contag, Ikeda, and Wapnir, and proposes an extended training plan including formal and informal learning opportunities, to aid the PI on her transition to independent faculty.",Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization,9491822,K99EB023279,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast-Conserving Surgery', 'CD276 gene', 'Callback', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethics', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Faculty', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'absorption', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'breast lesion', 'breast surgery', 'cancer biomarkers', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'course development', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic need', 'fluorescence imaging', 'formal learning', 'image processing', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informal learning', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'screening', 'targeted agent', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2018,76048,560644462,0.03751331918827884
"Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog PROJECT SUMMARY The current proposal, submitted to the special funding opportunity for Administrative Supplements for Integrative Data Analysis to Extend Research in Cancer Control and Population Sciences (NOT-CA-18-087), leverages the unique and rich data resource of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) comprising of >55,000 patients recruited at Michigan Medicine with complete array-based whole-genome genotyping data that are connected to rich longitudinal data retrieved from their electronic health records. In addition, we have access to information on behavioural data collected through a detailed questionnaire and geocoded residence information. These diverse sources of data allow us the possibility of creating novel and more accurate measures of exposures using questionnaire responses, structured and unstructured component of the electronic health record including clinical notes and the geocoded residential information. A key aspect of MGI is its enrichment for cancer outcomes. About 50% of the participants recruited so far have at least one neoplasm diagnosis in their health record. This is due to the recruitment of MGI participants from a perioperative setting. This cancer enrichment sets it apart from other biobanks and presents a unique opportunity at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center for cancer control and population sciences research. Our proposal aspires to establish an analytical framework to distil summary statistics of published genome- wide association studies for cancer into polygenic risk scores, to construct known and novel cancer-related exposures from clinical free text and data mining of geocoded residential data, and to utilize them in a screen for associations across the catalogued medical phenome, the ensemble of clinical diagnoses and biomarkers that are derived from routinely ordered lab tests in MGI. Correlated co-morbidities could, if pre-symptomatic, be used to improve cancer risk prediction, while associated exposures could inform on targeted strategies for cancer prevention and risk stratification. Novel findings will be replicated (when feasible) in the publicly accessible data of the UK Biobank, a population-based study of up to half a million participants. To differentiate between pre-symptomatic and post-treatment features, we will probe the existing time- stamped data of MGI that permit retrospective insights of up to ten years into a participant’s electronic medical records. Since there is an urgent need to better communicate results from such big data exploration with a broad and multi-disciplinary audience, e.g. to inspire follow-up replication and new hypothesis generation in cancer epidemiology and furthering our understanding of susceptibility mechanisms for cancer, we will develop a webpage to allow intuitive and interactive result browsing and open sharing. The proposal showcases the advantage of harmonization, integration of large and complex databases towards impactful research and powerful discovery tools in cancer control and population sciences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resource of the cancer-enriched cohort of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, this unique integrative data analysis proposal attempts to integrate genes, exposure and health history information as archived in an individual’s electronic medical records under a unifying analytic and scientific discovery framework. The ultimate goal is to give shape and structure to disparate sources of data towards principled discovery, inference and prediction. Through the proposed research we hope to achieve improved risk prediction, risk stratification and targeted prevention of cancer. Tools will be developed for wider dissemination of the results via an online visual catalog and make the results from massive, complex and heterogeneous sources of data accessible to other researchers, stakeholders and community participants. The proposal will showcase the potential for discoveries in cancer population-studies using unique data features from MGI, a medical center-based biobank and simultaneously leverage our access to the large population-based biobank, namely the UK Biobank, for replication and confirmation studies. In that sense, the proposal carries out integrative data analysis in two directions: (a) integrated analysis of diverse sources of data within MGI and (b) integrated use of MGI in concert with data from a large publicly available biobank, the UK Biobank.",Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog,9765877,P30CA046592,"['Access to Information', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Archives', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Inherited', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genome', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health record', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplasm registry', 'neoplasm resource', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'population based', 'recruit', 'repository', 'residence', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptom treatment', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web page', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2018,149955,641965656,0.039933574316425226
"Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer ABSTRACT Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Around 20% to 30% of women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer will have a recurrence and may eventually die of their disease. Currently, there are no reliable methods to identify which cancers will recur on an individual basis. Because of this, adjuvant therapies are given to nearly all patients with breast cancer, but benefit only a small proportion. A similar dilemma exists for neoadjuvant treatment, many patients fail to pathologically response to chemotherapy, and yet suffer from the associated toxicity. The conventional one-size-fits-all approach causes overtreatment, leading to morbidities and mortalities. To avoid these side effects, biomarkers that stratify patients with clinical relevance are critically needed for precision medicine in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is currently used to stratify breast cancer, but is limited by the requirement for invasive biopsy and confounded by intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity. Conversely, imaging provides a unique opportunity for the noninvasive interrogation of the tumor, its microenvironment, and invasion to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesize that imaging characteristics reflect underlying tumor biology, and quantitative imaging features can provide independent valuable information, which are synergistic to known clinical, histologic, and genetic predictors. Accordingly, we have planned three specific aims to develop new quantitative imaging biomarkers for breast cancer, as well as clinically and biologically validate them. In Aim 1 we plan to develop automated computational tools to robustly quantify whole tumor, intratumor subregions, and parenchyma phenotypes from multimodal MRI. The curated breast cancer cohort (n=504) from our preliminary study will be analyzed, with available MRI scans and manually-delineated contours of tumor and parenchyma by board-certified radiologists. In Aim 2 we will build imaging feature-based models to predict recurrence-free survival and treatment response separately. By integrating with clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, the comprehensive models can predict clinical outcomes more accurately. The internal cohort (n=450) will be used for discovery, and the multi-center prospective cohort from I-SPY (n=186) will be used for validation. In Aim 3 we will elucidate the biological underpinnings behind our newly identified prognostic and predictive imaging biomarkers, by correlating them with biospecimen-derived phenotypes from the same tumor. In particular, we will investigate multi-omics molecular data as well as tumor morphology from H&E stained pathology slides. Three cohorts will be analyzed, including our internal cohort (n=450), the I-SPY cohort (n=186), and the TCGA cohort (n=1095). For three proposed aims, we have carried preliminary studies to prove the feasibility. By leveraging the richness of available well-annotated data and advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, it will increase the likelihood of success. Our proposed research will point new biomarkers of high value to better predict recurrence and treatment response at the individual level, and lead to better treatment decisions for women with breast cancer. Narrative This project aims to augment the imaging role in the personalized management of breast cancer, by developing automated tools to extract quantitative imaging biomarkers from both tumor and parenchyma, as well as evaluating the biological and clinical relevance of these imaging biomarkers. The new imaging biomarkers will work synergistically with the existing clinicopathologic and genomic predictors, to better stratify breast cancer patients and guide individualized therapy. Together, these will promote a major paradigm shift of MR imaging role and allow it serve as an important approach in personalized cancer management.",Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers of Treatment Response and Prognosis in Breast Cancer,9526827,K99CA218667,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'TNM', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer subtypes', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contrast enhanced', 'effective therapy', 'genetic predictors', 'genomic predictors', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient stratification', 'personalized management', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary endpoint', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2018,160852,560644462,0.10058418179697176
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9470668,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2018,162511,6384662,0.0483598268069091
"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence. These methods will be used to derive individualized predictive indices of treatment outcomes based on a multimodal imaging dataset of rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative CRT. Our methods are generally applicable to radiomic studies of cancer patients. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader radiomics community.

"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema. n/a",SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema ,9536738,R01CA214085,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymph', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphedema', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Assessment', 'Self Care', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Swelling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'acute symptom', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'global health', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymph flow', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'movement analysis', 'pain symptom', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'person centered', 'prototype', 'psychological distress', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'symptom management', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,216636,77336088,0.07076753668274234
"Reducing recall rates of screening mammography with deep convolutional neural network PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the recent successes of screening mammography, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of death in women aged 45 to 55. This suggests that there is an urgent need to improve the current approaches to breast cancer screening based on mammography. The specificity of the screening mammography is also limited as the continued large fraction of false-positives often leads to unnecessary follow-up procedures including biopsy that cause considerable pain, anxiety and cost. It is therefore necessary to improve diagnostic accuracy of mammography in terms of both sensitivity for early detection of breast cancer and specificity to keep the recall rate 10% or less as recommended by American College of Radiology. In this study, we investigate deep convolutional networks (DCN) for medical imaging by developing from scratch a novel family of DCNs based on the characteristics of medical images and evaluating it on screening mammographic exams. We design a novel, multi-view DCN that will work with a set of multiple views in their original resolution so as to avoid missing crucial micro-structures, opposed to using heavily downscaled images as often done with natural images or by some earlier work on applying DCN to medical images. Unlike most existing works which verify their approaches on a small number of cases, we propose to train and test the proposed networks on a large-scale data consisting of about 500,000 cases collected over the period of five years at our institution. Our preliminary experiments using an initial version of the multi-view deep convolutional network with about 25,000 cases strongly support the need for the proposed large-scale, high- resolution deep learning for early-stage breast cancer screening. We have also collected 201,000 cases of screening mammograms to date and are in the process of annotating the cases based on the available follow- up studies. The overarching goal of this study is to develop, optimize and test a multi-view DCN system that can either independently read a series of screening mammographic exams to identify early breast cancers accurately or to assist a human reader so as to reduce reading time and improve confidence in early breast cancer detection. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening. Aim 2 is to conduct preliminary reader study on the impact of the MV-DCN as a screening exam aid system. The outcome of this study, the multi-view DCN for automatic breast screening and the preliminary assessment of its impact on human readers, will form an important basis on which further investigation into optimizing deep convolution networks for medical imaging can be conducted. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of screening mammography in terms of both sensitivity for early detection of breast cancer and specificity to minimize the recall rate to avoid unnecessary follow-up procedures. The overarching goal of this study is to develop, optimize and test a multi-view deep convolutional network system that can either independently read a series of screening mammographic exams to identify early breast cancers accurately or to assist a human reader to reduce reading time and improve confidence in early breast cancer detection. This study will be conducted with a large-scale data consisting of 500,000 screening mammography cases collected over the period of 5 years at our institution.",Reducing recall rates of screening mammography with deep convolutional neural network,9607399,R21CA225175,"['Agreement', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pain', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'calcification', 'case-based', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'interest', 'large-scale database', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'screening', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,218865,329565273,0.055110538905501924
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9486120,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,321839,340417756,0.04841400453501537
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,9410515,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,323434,758431960,0.022406519419964608
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q-BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinical trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there.

"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9605321,R37CA232209,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2018,445227,570146095,0.028317539072146007
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9522076,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466230,533594881,0.05033152262850542
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9550931,U01CA184902,"['Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'ERR1 protein', 'ESR1 gene', 'Endocrine', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population Sizes', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Tamoxifen', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'human data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,521796,50343425,0.0902587863360104
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,9631128,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,587514,157845771,0.1007152008671051
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9512832,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,608223,197030888,0.044133962528101894
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer.

"Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy Project Abstract More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. BBD is associated with increases in BC risk, ranging from 1.5-2.0 times for least severe categories to fourfold for most severe types. However, these risks apply to groups of women, not individuals, and individual risk varies considerably within BBD categories. Further, we have shown that breast cancer (BC) risk prediction models, such as the “Gail Model”, perform poorly among women with BBD. Previously, we developed the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies, which provides individual risk estimates based on self-reported factors, detailed characteristics of BBD extent and severity, and assessment of involution (shrinkage and disappearance) of surrounding histologic structures (terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)) from which most BC precursors arise. BBD-BC outperforms the Gail Model in predicting BC risk. However, given that radiologically-guided small (percutaneous) biopsies have largely replaced surgical biopsies for diagnosis, a new model based on this biopsy approach is needed. Further, the emergence of mammographic density as an important BC risk factor, development of novel methods to assess TDLU involution and increased use of biomarkers in routinely processed clinical samples offer an opportunity to develop an improved BC risk prediction tool for women with percutaneous biopsy diagnoses of BBD. The goal of this project is to build a BC risk prediction tool for women with BBD diagnosed on percutaneous needle biopsy that could be validated in diverse populations and implemented clinically. We propose to develop a cohort at Mayo that includes >7,000 women who were diagnosed with BBD on a percutaneous biopsy of whom >400 later developed BC. We will develop a model to predict BC that includes factors in the BBD-BC model for surgical biopsies. We will also assess mammographic density, measured as a volume and area, using validated methods. We will identify immunohistochemical markers that can be applied to BBD biopsies to predict future risk of developing BC and evaluate novel NanoString RNA assays, which measure expression of related genes as composite “signatures” reflecting cancer-like characteristics, proliferation, and a mutation-like score for the important TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Finally, we will develop an epidemiologic “case-cohort” that includes a random subset of women from the full cohort (n~500) and all the women that developed invasive BC (n~250). We will evaluate BC risk prediction in this case-cohort of 750 women to evaluate performance of risk models without biomarkers and with biomarkers using novel machine learning approaches that offer strengths compared with more typical statistical models. Using these data, we will build an absolute risk prediction model for the full cohort that can be tested in other populations. Project Narrative More than one million women are diagnosed with benign breast disease (BBD) by percutaneous biopsy annually in the U.S. and would benefit from improved breast cancer (BC) risk information as they face screening and prevention decisions. Although routine pathology diagnoses stratify groups of women with BBD into different levels of BC risk, individual risks vary greatly within these categories. Leveraging discoveries in prior work that resulted in a predictive model for BBD diagnosed on surgical biopsies, we will build a new model for percutaneous biopsies (now the dominant sampling method), which incorporates mammographic density, novel tissue biomarkers and machine learning statistical approaches.",Predicting Breast Cancer Risk after Benign Percutaneous Biopsy,9578200,R01CA229811,"['Age', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cox Models', 'Cytokeratin 8', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Individual', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic Density', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'RNA', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surgical Models', 'TP53 gene', 'Terminal Ductal Lobular Unit', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'disease diagnosis', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'senescence', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,R01,2018,640367,0,0.06474768247409293
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9534547,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2018,752888,228951281,0.033373231903285505
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and other factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Claiming more than 40,000 lives in the United States in 2015, breast cancer presents an important health focus. Mammography and ultrasound, current screening methods, suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value, respectively, particularly in patients with dense breast tissues. Therefore, a non-invasive method of distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions that could be incorporated with current screening modalities is critically needed. With more advanced screening methods, there is an increase in the detection of early malignant lesions, for which breast-conserving treatment has become more routine. However, intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment is time consuming and suffers from low sensitivity, while post-operative histological analysis leaves potential for positive margins, strongly correlated with reoccurrence. Therefore, a real-time method to detect tumor margins intraoperatively is critically needed. We propose using spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging combined with a clinically- translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker (B7-H3) to non-invasively distinguish normal from malignant tissues both during screening (aim 1) and intraoperatively during surgical resection (aim 3). The sensitivity of this imaging method will be increased with the use of machine learning post-processing algorithms to autonomously detect molecular B7-H3 signal (aim 2). In summary, this proposal will result in significant change to current clinical breast imaging and surgical resection practice to improve the detection and treatment of focal breast lesions. The training portion of this plan, required to accomplish these research goals, has been designed with trainee mentors with specific technical expertise. Dr. Willmann is an expert in translational molecular imaging and contrast agent use, while Dr. Rubin is an expert in bioinformatics, image processing, and machine learning for medical imagine purposes. Additionally, the project is supported by a diverse advisory committee with experts in clinical breast imaging (Dr. Debra Ikeda), optical imaging and intraoperative guidance (Dr. Christopher Contag), and clinical breast surgery (Dr. Irene Wapnir). To date, the candidate has developed expertise in photoacoustic, ultrasound, and fluorescence molecular imaging and molecular contrast agent development and in vivo use during her graduate and postdoctoral research. Her long term career goals include developing clinically translatable combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging methods combined with novel contrast agents for cancer detection and differentiation. Additionally, her research will focus on developing machine learning algorithms for increasing the sensitivity of the molecular imaging approach as well as adapting her method for therapeutic purposes. In preparation for her independent research career, the training plan includes formal education in machine learning, digital signal processing, optical imaging, and cancer biology, as well as in career development classes and ethical conduct of research. Narrative Mammography and ultrasound used for breast cancer screening suffer from low sensitivity and low positive predictive value in women with dense breast tissue (40%). Here, combined spectroscopic photoacoustic and fluorescence molecular imaging used with a clinically-translatable contrast agent targeted to a novel breast cancer marker and novel machine learning based spectral recognition algorithms are explored for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions and for intraoperative tumor margin assessment. The project is supported by excellent mentors, Drs. Willmann and Rubin, and a diverse advisory committee, Drs. Contag, Ikeda, and Wapnir, and proposes an extended training plan including formal and informal learning opportunities, to aid the PI on her transition to independent faculty.",Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging for Breast Lesion Characterization,9314864,K99EB023279,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'CD276 gene', 'Callback', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Ethics', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Faculty', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indocyanine Green', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Postoperative Period', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'absorption', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'breast lesion', 'breast surgery', 'cancer biomarkers', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'course development', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic need', 'fluorescence imaging', 'formal learning', 'image processing', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informal learning', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'screening', 'targeted agent', 'targeted imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,76048,560644462,0.03751331918827884
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9562949,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2017,80500,593605914,0.047357790957524265
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of cancer care.",Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance,9325566,R00LM011595,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Supervision', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug development', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'signal processing', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R00,2017,194545,36067938,0.06846873016670736
"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema. n/a",SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema ,9355598,R01CA214085,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Information Technology', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymph', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphedema', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Assessment', 'Self Care', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Swelling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'acute symptom', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'global health', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymph flow', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'movement analysis', 'pain symptom', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'person centered', 'prototype', 'psychological distress', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'symptom management', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,227835,77336088,0.07076753668274234
"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8996183,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,323753,758431960,0.022406519419964608
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9381186,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,362188,533594881,0.05033152262850542
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,9344562,R01CA199996,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gland', 'Global Change', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Microscopy', 'Needles', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Normal Range', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Width', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast surgery', 'cohort', 'density', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'milk secretion', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'obesity risk', 'outcome prediction', 'population health', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'second harmonic', 'second harmonic generation imaging', 'support network', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,431130,338121506,0.09830739379226712
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9350254,U01CA184902,"['Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'ERR1 protein', 'ESR1 gene', 'Endocrine', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population Sizes', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Tamoxifen', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'human data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,458386,50343425,0.0902587863360104
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP.

"(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. Muscle mass (MM) exerts powerful endocrine, immune, and hormonal influences within the body. Sarcopenia (low muscle mass or muscle wasting) and sarcopenic obesity"" (i.e., obesity and low muscle mass) are common in breast cancer survivors and may be further exacerbated by oncological treatments which increase fat mass and reduce muscle mass. In response to PQ2, ""How does obesity relate to cancer risk"", we propose to examine in addition to adiposity or fat mass (FM) alone, the effect of MM and the relationship of adiposity to muscularity on breast cancer outcomes. This will further our understanding of the ideal body composition associated with the best prognosis and may help explain the observation that overweight and (mild) obesity predict elevated risk of breast cancer, but paradoxically do not always predict higher mortality after diagnosis compared with those who are normal-weight or underweight. Recently, methods to measure FM and MM using abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) scans have been developed and validated to identify individuals with sarcopenia. In two cohorts of women (total n=3,250) diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 with Stage I-III invasive breast cancer at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI), we will use CT scans collected as part of routine care at diagnosis, and assess FM and MM in order to understand the role of body composition, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer prognosis in an attempt to explain how obesity relates to survival risk. Specifically, we will examine the level of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer survivors at diagnosis and how that varies by important medical and demographic characteristics (Aim 1). We will also examine associations between FM, MM, sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and cardiometabolic risk factors (Aim 2); chemotoxicity (Aim 3); and breast cancer-specific and overall mortality (Aim 4). Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate most associations, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality. The proposed study is the first large-scale investigation to examine the role of body composition at diagnosis and before treatment on breast cancer outcomes. This study uses a novel, state-of-the art tool to measure fat/muscle mass that is biologically more relevant than standard measures of height and weight, and could provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival. This study has the potential for high impact since CT scans already collected as a part of regular care could be used to assess fat and muscle mass with little added extra cost. Alternatively, other methods including dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans or bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) could be adopted into clinical practice, adding an important physiologic measure to BMI to help target and personalize weight control strategies and other treatments to prevent muscle mass loss, and improve survival. Both FM and MM have independent metabolic roles in breast cancer prognosis that may ultimately help to explain the mechanistic pathways underlying the association between obesity and breast cancer survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. The importance of muscle mass in breast cancer survival has not been adequately studied. This study will examine the extent of body fat and muscle mass as well as sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and sarcopenic obesity (low muscle mass and obesity) among women diagnosed with breast cancer to evaluate how these conditions influence prognosis. Study findings may provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival and may lead to more tailored treatment strategies.",(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival,9320716,R01CA184953,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Catabolism', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cox Models', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Endocrine', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Height', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mild obesity', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Survivors', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer risk', 'cancer survival', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional status', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'reduced muscle mass', 'response', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,607944,111231681,0.10815841476614729
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9305968,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,624988,197030888,0.044133962528101894
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9326822,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2017,636030,593605914,0.047357790957524265
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9295773,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2017,766250,228951281,0.033373231903285505
"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project. The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.",Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease,9031091,R03CA191559,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse Brain Injury', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Injury', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Factor', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'chemobrain', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive skill', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome prediction']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2016,80000,175892898,0.07401941564281646
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of cancer care.",Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance,9118386,R00LM011595,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Center', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Staging', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug development', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'signal processing', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R00,2016,202054,36067938,0.06846873016670736
"SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema  Many breast cancer survivors face long-term post-operative challenges as a result of suffering from breast cancer related lymphedema (hereafter, lymphedema), which causes abnormal swelling and multiple distressing and sometimes extremely painful symptoms. These symptoms have been linked to clinically detrimental outcomes, such as disability and psychological distress, both of which are known risk factors for breast cancer survivors' poor quality of life. More importantly, lymphedema symptoms may indicate an early stage of lymphedema that constitutes only minimal changes in objective measures of limb volume. Without timely intervention in this early disease stage, lymphedema can progress into a chronic condition that no surgical or medical interventions at present can cure. Yet, current clinical practice largely relies on clinicians' observation of swelling and current research methods for detecting and assessing lymphedema are cumbersome and not effective in detecting early stage of lymphedema. Thus, early detection of lymphedema based on symptoms and early intervention for lymphedema symptom management may play an important role in reducing the patient's risk for chronic lymphedema. The first primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to understand the association between symptoms and other relevant personal and clinical factors and the presence of lymphedema, and develop a web-based self-assessment platform that enables patients to assess their risk for lymphedema from anywhere. The second goal is to develop a Kinect-sensor based training system to improve the effectiveness of training for patients to learn and practice the intervention lymphatic exercises developed by the Pl Fu, which have shown great promise in reducing the risk of chronic lymphedema by maintaining pre-surgery limb volume, and relieving lymphedema symptoms. The proposed solutions empower breast cancer survivors to take control of their progression path of lymphedema, and will be integrated into our current IT-based self-care platform for lymphedema symptom management and lymphedema risk reduction, which focuses on preventive, proactive, evidence-based, person-centered approach to improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Lymphedema, which causes multiple painful symptoms, is a major health problem that affects more than 40% of 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the US. This project will develop a self-assessment platform for . early detection of lymphedema and a Kinect-based exercise training system to enhance early intervention. The project has the potential to relieve lymphedema symptoms and reduce the risk for chronic lymphedema. n/a",SCH: EXP: Improving early detection and intervention of lymphedema ,9267301,R01CA214085,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exercise', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ipsilateral', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymph', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphedema', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Assessment', 'Self Care', 'Series', 'Shoulder', 'Staging', 'Swelling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Upper Extremity', 'acute symptom', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'global health', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymph flow', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'movement analysis', 'pain symptom', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'persistent symptom', 'person centered', 'prototype', 'psychological distress', 'reduce symptoms', 'sensor', 'support tools', 'symptom management', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'visual feedback']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,229942,77336088,0.07076753668274234
"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,9139431,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone use', 'Hormones', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lobular', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Masks', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postmenopause', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Relative Risks', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'density', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'hazard', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'screening', 'tumor registry', 'uptake']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,242078,276703803,0.1128268252872737
"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65. Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.",Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations,9057470,R01CA165229,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Diseases', 'Breast biopsy', 'Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Modeling', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publications', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cancer subtypes', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic screening', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older women', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'simulation', 'sobriety', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,349800,338121506,0.11154562948031257
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM) PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens.

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,9122340,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'racial and ethnic', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,386725,685608202,0.011989072065474752
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,9133341,R01CA199996,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gland', 'Global Change', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Microscopy', 'Milk', 'Needles', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Normal Range', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Width', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast surgery', 'cohort', 'density', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'population health', 'protein expression', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'second harmonic', 'support network', 'survival prediction', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,464700,338121506,0.09830739379226712
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,9136773,U01CA184902,"['Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'ERR1 protein', 'ESR1 gene', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population Sizes', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Tamoxifen', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,568354,50343425,0.0902587863360104
"(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. Muscle mass (MM) exerts powerful endocrine, immune, and hormonal influences within the body. Sarcopenia (low muscle mass or muscle wasting) and sarcopenic obesity"" (i.e., obesity and low muscle mass) are common in breast cancer survivors and may be further exacerbated by oncological treatments which increase fat mass and reduce muscle mass. In response to PQ2, ""How does obesity relate to cancer risk"", we propose to examine in addition to adiposity or fat mass (FM) alone, the effect of MM and the relationship of adiposity to muscularity on breast cancer outcomes. This will further our understanding of the ideal body composition associated with the best prognosis and may help explain the observation that overweight and (mild) obesity predict elevated risk of breast cancer, but paradoxically do not always predict higher mortality after diagnosis compared with those who are normal-weight or underweight. Recently, methods to measure FM and MM using abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) scans have been developed and validated to identify individuals with sarcopenia. In two cohorts of women (total n=3,250) diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 with Stage I-III invasive breast cancer at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI), we will use CT scans collected as part of routine care at diagnosis, and assess FM and MM in order to understand the role of body composition, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer prognosis in an attempt to explain how obesity relates to survival risk. Specifically, we will examine the level of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer survivors at diagnosis and how that varies by important medical and demographic characteristics (Aim 1). We will also examine associations between FM, MM, sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and cardiometabolic risk factors (Aim 2); chemotoxicity (Aim 3); and breast cancer-specific and overall mortality (Aim 4). Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate most associations, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality. The proposed study is the first large-scale investigation to examine the role of body composition at diagnosis and before treatment on breast cancer outcomes. This study uses a novel, state-of-the art tool to measure fat/muscle mass that is biologically more relevant than standard measures of height and weight, and could provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival. This study has the potential for high impact since CT scans already collected as a part of regular care could be used to assess fat and muscle mass with little added extra cost. Alternatively, other methods including dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans or bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) could be adopted into clinical practice, adding an important physiologic measure to BMI to help target and personalize weight control strategies and other treatments to prevent muscle mass loss, and improve survival. Both FM and MM have independent metabolic roles in breast cancer prognosis that may ultimately help to explain the mechanistic pathways underlying the association between obesity and breast cancer survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. The importance of muscle mass in breast cancer survival has not been adequately studied. This study will examine the extent of body fat and muscle mass as well as sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and sarcopenic obesity (low muscle mass and obesity) among women diagnosed with breast cancer to evaluate how these conditions influence prognosis. Study findings may provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival and may lead to more tailored treatment strategies.",(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival,9081551,R01CA184953,"['Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'California', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Catabolism', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cox Models', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Endocrine', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Height', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mild obesity', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Survivors', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer risk', 'cancer survival', 'cardiometabolic risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional status', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'reduced muscle mass', 'response', 'routine care', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,602462,111231681,0.10815841476614729
"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,9016496,R01CA166269,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mammography', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'prospective', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NCI,H.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9176586,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,699670,197030888,0.044133962528101894
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Difficulties with cognitive skills such as memory, thinking and attention are very common after breast cancer chemotherapy. These cognitive difficulties have been associated with chemotherapy-related injury to several brain regions, particularly those regions that also tend to be affected by brain aging. There is concern that chemotherapy may accelerate brain aging and increase patients' risk for Alzheimer's disease. Certain previous studies support this concern while others do not and therefore the effect of breast cancer chemotherapy on risk for Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. The proposed research will compare brain anatomy of breast cancer survivors to that of women who later developed Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence, we will determine a pattern of brain anatomy that indicates the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. This pattern, or classifier, will be determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that were obtained for approximately 100 women with Alzheimer's disease compared to MRI scans from a group of approximately 100 healthy, unaffected women. We will then apply the classifier to MRI scans from 108 breast cancer survivors, 67 who received chemotherapy treatment and 41 who did not. Using the machine learning classifier, we will calculate a score for each breast cancer survivor that indicates her probability of developing Alzheimer's disease based on her brain anatomy. We believe that probability scores will be significantly higher in the chemotherapy group compared to the no-chemotherapy group. We will also explore possible predictors of probability score such as demographic, disease, genetic and treatment factors. This project has the potential to improve our ability to identify patients at risk for persistent and/or progressive chemotherapy-related brain injury using a simple, non-invasive five minute MRI scan. This information could potentially inform treatment decision-making and prioritize patients for early intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of women who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer will experience long- term problems with brain function, such as thinking, memory and attention that reduce quality of life and extend disease-related disability. The proposed study aims to improve our understanding regarding the brain changes that occur following breast cancer chemotherapy. This research is highly relevant to breast cancer, one of the most common public health problems, affecting 1 in 8 women.            ",Machine Learning Comparison of Brain Anatomy in Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease,8813205,R03CA191559,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse Brain Injury', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Factor', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aging brain', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'chemobrain', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive reserve', 'cognitive skill', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'public health relevance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R03,2015,80000,175892898,0.07401941564281646
"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary         research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), the may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults -- more than 16 million people -- who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8786066,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,83928,533594881,0.0408059721290568
"Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel image-based breast cancer risk factor based on functional behavior of breast fibroglandular tissue that can improve risk stratification of women with mammographically dense breasts. Over 40% of screening-eligible women have mammographically dense breasts, which refers to a high amount of fibroglandular tissue relative to fat on a mammogram. These women are at elevated risk of developing breast cancer, based on a large body of evidence showing density as one of the strongest risk factors, and are increasingly encouraged to discuss their density-related risk with providers. Yet, the discriminatory accuracy of breast density is weak, limiting its usefulness in clinical risk prediction. We postulate that mammographic density does have importance in risk assessment, with the critical caveat that not all dense tissue confers equivalent risk. Because mammography creates an anatomic depiction of the breast, it is inherently unable to distinguish the known functional heterogeneity of breast fibroglandular tissue among women that likely has important implications in regards to breast cancer risk. We propose that functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue or level of background parenchymal uptake (BPU) that can be assessed on molecular breast imaging (MBI) exams allows for a non-invasive means for determining the subset of women with dense tissue who are at greatest risk of developing breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will establish a retrospective cohort study of 3300 women who had screening MBI performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester between the years 2004 - 2015. MBI exams, mammograms, and medical history information will be obtained; assessments of BPU and mammographic density from existing imaging will be performed; and incident breast cancers in the cohort will be identified via the Mayo Clinic tumor registry and mailed follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use this well-characterized cohort to examine the association of BPU (assessed both categorically and quantitatively) and breast cancer risk. Cox proportional-hazards regression will be employed in a multivariable model with adjustments for covariates, including mammographic density. An exploratory analysis of the interaction between BPU and mammographic density will also be performed using a Gradient Boosting Machine learning algorithm. We hypothesize that high BPU will be associated with increased cancer risk relative to low BPU, beyond the association observed between density and risk. We will also explore whether BPU stratifies the risk associated with dense breasts. This work is the first evaluation of BPU on MBI as a breast cancer risk factor and the first investigation into whether functional behavior of fibroglandular tissue can discriminate risk of mammographically dense tissue. For increasing numbers of women who are now undergoing MBI for supplemental breast screening, this additional risk information will be valuable in guiding clinical decisions regarding tailored screening and risk-reduction options.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of women in the U.S. who are eligible for screening mammography, 43% or 27.5 million are estimated to have mammographically dense breasts - a factor strongly associated with increased breast cancer risk. Yet, mammographic density has limited discriminatory accuracy to be useful for risk assessment. We propose that assessment of the functional behavior of dense tissue, as imaged by a molecular breast imaging (MBI) exam, can identify the subset of women with dense breasts who are at the greatest risk of developing breast cancer, and therefore are most likely to benefit from increased surveillance or preventive risk-reduction options.            ",Background parenchymal uptake (BPU) on molecular breast imaging as a novel breast cancer risk factor,8956477,R21CA197752,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone use', 'Hormones', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lobular', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Masks', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postmenopause', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relative Risks', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'density', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'hazard', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'screening', 'tumor registry', 'uptake']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,138330,276703803,0.1128268252872737
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8827726,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,165844,533594881,0.060024051266454326
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8829207,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic approach', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,168280,685608202,0.004886471869116165
"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of cancer care.",Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance,9076623,R00LM011595,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Center', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R00,2015,200109,36067938,0.06846873016670736
"Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among males and the twelfth most common cancer among females in the United States. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in bladder cancer recurrence, progression and survival have been reported by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Quality gaps and treatment inequity may contribute to outcomes disparities. In contrast to immutable factors such as genetic or anatomic characteristics, treatment inequity represents a modifiable factor. Thus, our study will identify quality gaps in bladder cancer care and elucidate treatment disparities in order to inform future quality improvement interventions. Effective treatments for bladder cancer exist but may be underutilized at all stages of diagnosis. Treatments include the use of intravesical chemotherapy within 24 hours of the initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radical cystectomy. Failure to use intravesical chemotherapy immediately post-tumor resection (and thus to prevent tumor recurrences) has been estimated to cost the United States around $20 million annually. Increasing the use of guideline-consistent care thus has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities while also decreasing healthcare costs. Treatment disparities across patients group have been observed, although findings have not been consistent. Most studies have not comprehensively evaluated bladder cancer care but instead have focused on a few treatment practices, and existing research also may not reflect contemporary treatment patterns. We propose to comprehensively evaluate bladder cancer treatment overall and by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age (Aim 1) and calendar time (Aim 2) in order to identify quality gaps and treatment inequities. Our research team includes an epidemiologist, health economist, two urologists, and a biostatistician/analyst. We will create a retrospective cohort of all patients age 21 years or older diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2001- 2013 within the large, diverse, community-based membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We will use our high-quality cancer registry and rich electronic health record to evaluate care among over 9,000 bladder cancer patients. Treatment practices will be coded as yes/no to indicate adherence to well-established treatment recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to evaluate differences in treatment adherence across patients groups. Poisson regression or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models will be employed to evaluate treatment practices over time. The completion of these aims will provide a detailed comparison of recommended and actual treatment practices by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age, and calendar time for a wide range of bladder cancer treatment recommendations. Future quality         improvement efforts may build upon the results to target the treatment gaps with the greatest potential to reduce disparities and improve care delivery and patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among men and the thirteenth among women, and it is the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in recurrence, progression, and mortality have been reported across different patient groups and may be due in part to variability in treatment use. We will compare recommended and actual treatment practices for bladder cancer by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age in order to elucidate treatment gaps and disparities, with the underlying goal of informing future quality improvement efforts to improve care delivery and reduce disparities.",Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment,8930089,R21CA185931,"['21 year old', 'Adherence', 'African American', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Appointment', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Calendar', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cytology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intravesical Administration', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Time', 'Transurethral Resection', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Urologist', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'intravesical', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplasm registry', 'older patient', 'prevent', 'sex', 'treatment adherence', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2015,217348,111231681,0.03218138534683398
"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years). This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.",Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification,8826571,R01CA160205,"['Age', 'Benign', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Mammography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scheme', 'Screening for cancer', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'density', 'design', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'young woman']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2015,226815,9101010,0.12457026251950705
"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,758431960,0.022406519419964608
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cancer Patient', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Cancer History', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nomads', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'age group', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cyber security', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental carcinogenesis', 'experience', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'population migration', 'social', 'social networking website', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,0,0.02006464171022375
"Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death among women at the age of 40 and older. Mammography has been used as a low-cost screening tool for breast cancer. The recent controversy on breast cancer screening recommendations has increased public awareness and interests for informed counseling of screening and health care options based on individualized estimates of risk. The goal of this proposed project is to develop a computerized image-based biomarker to assess the breast cancer risk of individual patients in the screening population. The innovation of our approach lies in the fact that the quantitative breast parenchyma descriptor (q-BPD) will be designed to take into account not only the percentage of dense tissue (PD) but also the stromal and epithelial structural pattern of an individual's breast that is complementary to, rather than a surrogate of, the breast density. The q-BPD is obtained by a joint analysis of the complexity of the parenchymal distribution pattern (mammographic parenchymal pattern, MPP) and the amount of dense tissue (PD) as they are imaged on full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs). We hypothesize that the proposed q-BPD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and will have a stronger predictive power than previous approaches such as PD or BI-RADS density categories alone. To test the hypothesis, we have the following specific aims: (1) to collect a matched case-control data set of 500 breast cancer cases and 2000 matched controls with 5 years of prior FFDMs (prior to cancer diagnosis for the case group). We will split the entire data set into independent subsets for training and validation; (2) to design a q- BPD by using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to maximize the discriminatory power at the personal level; (3) to investigate the association of developed q-BPD with breast cancer risk in comparison with commonly used density descriptors, such as radiologist's estimates of BI-RADS density categories and interactive PD on FFDMs by case-control studies and statistical analyses, taking into account other confounding risk factors. When fully developed, the automated q-BPD can be incorporated as a part of routine breast cancer screening. It will not only be useful for breast cancer risk prediction for individual patients but also for monitoring of risk regression or progression over time due to treatment or other factors. The new risk prediction tool is expected to play a key role in personalized breast cancer screening for women at different risk levels, thereby reducing health care costs while benefiting high risk women. The success of this project will lay the foundation for future large-scale clinica trials to address the limitations and investigate the clinical utilities of the proposed q-BPD for breast cancer risk prediction. Key Words: quantitative breast parenchyma analysis, image-based biomarker, breast cancer risk prediction, full-field digital mammogram (FFDM)         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed quantitative descriptor of breast parenchyma (q-BPD) can serve as a cost-effective biomarker to assist in stratification of screening strategy for individuals, follow-up, risk management, and monitoring of preventive treatment of high-risk women or interventional treatment of breast cancer patients, as well as for research and development of new treatment regimens. This will be a step towards the development of personalized medicine and reducing the overall health care costs.            ",Quantitative Parenchyma Descriptor as an Imaging Biomarker of Breast Cancer Risk,8890485,U01CA195599,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Effectiveness', 'Epithelial', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast density', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'compare effectiveness', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'research and development', 'screening', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,412385,641965656,0.13196052362800637
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8930929,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,428238,685608202,0.011989072065474752
"Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose that collagen features, such as alignment, fiber straightness and width, and other features of extracellular matrix composition can be used as an early biomarker of breast cancer. It is the goal of this proposal to determine the range of collagen structural features that characterize normal, benign and early disease, to determine how these features relate to mammographic density, and to identify the features that best predict risk, recurrence, and progression. This proposal leverages a diverse collaborative team that includes experts in imaging and understanding the tumor microenvironment, breast surgery, experts in population health and biostatistics, and an expert in proteomic analysis of the ECM. This team will analyze a set of patient cohorts to develop imaging and analysis of collagen structure and ECM composition as a potential early biomarker for breast cancer. Aims: 1) Characterize collagen features that define heterogeneity of the normal state. 2) Characterize collagen features in pre- and early breast cancer lesions. 3) Characterize the proteomics of biopsies representing benign, at risk, and invasive breast cancer. Significance: This project meets the goals of the RFA to develop and validate combined imaging and biomarker approaches to improve early cancer detection and the diagnosis of early-stage cancers. Our findings have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and false positives and discern lethal from non-lethal disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The widespread adoption of screening mammography throughout the 1980s and 1990s led to a reduction in breast cancer mortality as more women were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease and could be more successfully treated. Apart from their use in visualizing the tumor, mammograms are quantifiable based on the density of the signal in the image, which is based on the absorbance of x-rays by cells and the filamentous protein collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and in the breast is present as a scaffolding network that supports the milk-secreting epithelial cells of this gland. In non-diseased breasts, the mammographic density is a function of the amount of collagen present, and is highly correlated to a 4-6 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammographic density has been deemed so important that over a dozen states have recently passed legislation requiring physicians to inform patients of this value. However, the problem is that mammographic density does not predict survival once a tumor has been detected. Thus, although we have improved our detection of breast cancers, we do not have the ability to sort patients into groups where disease progresses from those that do not. Our current paradigm of treating everyone aggressively needs to change to a targeted plan of treating only those women at risk of future life-threatening disease. It is our hypothesis that it is not the overall macroscpic amount of collagen present, but rather the structure and organization of collagen at the local level which predicts cancer progression. We will examine tissue samples from a variety of non-diseased human patient cohorts, with the goal of discovering a biomarker for disease progression based on collagen structure. This will be done non-invasively by imaging slides that are already routinely prepared using a technique called second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy which selectively images collagen. We have advanced software which will measure the length, width, straightness, density and orientation of fibers that we can use to analyze tens of thousands of collagen fibers from dozens of images per sample. This high level of quantitation improves our statistical ability to discover the underlying biomarker from the noise. By understanding the normal non-diseased state, we can apply this knowledge to very early cancer stages in order to sort patients into aggressive and non-aggressive therapy groups. As a compliment to these studies, we will also determine the protein composition of the collagen matrix, as there are dozens of other proteins present. Preliminary data has shown changes in the makeup of proteins found in normal tissue compared to breast cancer, implying that the change in collagen structure is related to the underlying expression of proteins there. Through our proposed experiments, we will establish what a truly ""normal"" collagen matrix looks like in terms of structure and composition.            ",Collagen structural changes as an early biomarker for breast carcinoma,8985889,R01CA199996,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gland', 'Global Change', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammographic Density', 'Mammography', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Menopause', 'Microscopy', 'Milk', 'Needles', 'Noise', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Normal Range', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Width', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'breast density', 'breast surgery', 'cohort', 'density', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'population health', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'second harmonic', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,505303,338121506,0.09830739379226712
"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,8928084,U01CA184902,"['Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'ERR1 protein', 'ESR1 gene', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population Sizes', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Tamoxifen', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,564382,50343425,0.0902587863360104
"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8817150,R01CA166269,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mammography', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NCI,H.

"(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. Muscle mass (MM) exerts powerful endocrine, immune, and hormonal influences within the body. Sarcopenia (low muscle mass or muscle wasting) and sarcopenic obesity"" (i.e., obesity and low muscle mass) are common in breast cancer survivors and may be further exacerbated by oncological treatments which increase fat mass and reduce muscle mass. In response to PQ2, ""How does obesity relate to cancer risk"", we propose to examine in addition to adiposity or fat mass (FM) alone, the effect of MM and the relationship of adiposity to muscularity on breast cancer outcomes. This will further our understanding of the ideal body composition associated with the best prognosis and may help explain the observation that overweight and (mild) obesity predict elevated risk of breast cancer, but paradoxically do not always predict higher mortality after diagnosis compared with those who are normal-weight or underweight. Recently, methods to measure FM and MM using abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) scans have been developed and validated to identify individuals with sarcopenia. In two cohorts of women (total n=3,250) diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 with Stage I-III invasive breast cancer at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI), we will use CT scans collected as part of routine care at diagnosis, and assess FM and MM in order to understand the role of body composition, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer prognosis in an attempt to explain how obesity relates to survival risk. Specifically, we will examine the level of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer survivors at diagnosis and how that varies by important medical and demographic characteristics (Aim 1). We will also examine associations between FM, MM, sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and cardiometabolic risk factors (Aim 2); chemotoxicity (Aim 3); and breast cancer-specific and overall mortality (Aim 4). Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate most associations, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality. The proposed study is the first large-scale investigation to examine the role of body composition at diagnosis and before treatment on breast cancer outcomes. This study uses a novel, state-of-the art tool to measure fat/muscle mass that is biologically more relevant than standard measures of height and weight, and could provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival. This study has the potential for high impact since CT scans already collected as a part of regular care could be used to assess fat and muscle mass with little added extra cost. Alternatively, other methods including dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans or bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) could be adopted into clinical practice, adding an important physiologic measure to BMI to help target and personalize weight control strategies and other treatments to prevent muscle mass loss, and improve survival. Both FM and MM have independent metabolic roles in breast cancer prognosis that may ultimately help to explain the mechanistic pathways underlying the association between obesity and breast cancer survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. The importance of muscle mass in breast cancer survival has not been adequately studied. This study will examine the extent of body fat and muscle mass as well as sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and sarcopenic obesity (low muscle mass and obesity) among women diagnosed with breast cancer to evaluate how these conditions influence prognosis.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.                ",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,8967740,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'open source', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2015,653458,593605914,0.047357790957524265
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.             PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of cancer care.",Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance,8707556,K99LM011595,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NLM,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2014,89641,178569161,0.06846873016670736
"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR  Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), they may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults-more than 16 million people-who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.            ",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8633184,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,102407,533594881,0.04068974019015485
"Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment  Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among males and the twelfth most common cancer among females in the United States. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in bladder cancer recurrence, progression and survival have been reported by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Quality gaps and treatment inequity may contribute to outcomes disparities. In contrast to immutable factors such as genetic or anatomic characteristics, treatment inequity represents a modifiable factor. Thus, our study will identify quality gaps in bladder cancer care and elucidate treatment disparities in order to inform future quality improvement interventions. Effective treatments for bladder cancer exist but may be underutilized at all stages of diagnosis. Treatments include the use of intravesical chemotherapy within 24 hours of the initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radical cystectomy. Failure to use intravesical chemotherapy immediately post-tumor resection (and thus to prevent tumor recurrences) has been estimated to cost the United States around $20 million annually. Increasing the use of guideline-consistent care thus has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities while also decreasing healthcare costs. Treatment disparities across patients group have been observed, although findings have not been consistent. Most studies have not comprehensively evaluated bladder cancer care but instead have focused on a few treatment practices, and existing research also may not reflect contemporary treatment patterns. We propose to comprehensively evaluate bladder cancer treatment overall and by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age (Aim 1) and calendar time (Aim 2) in order to identify quality gaps and treatment inequities. Our research team includes an epidemiologist, health economist, two urologists, and a biostatistician/analyst. We will create a retrospective cohort of all patients age 21 years or older diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2001- 2013 within the large, diverse, community-based membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We will use our high-quality cancer registry and rich electronic health record to evaluate care among over 9,000 bladder cancer patients. Treatment practices will be coded as yes/no to indicate adherence to well-established treatment recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to evaluate differences in treatment adherence across patients groups. Poisson regression or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models will be employed to evaluate treatment practices over time. The completion of these aims will provide a detailed comparison of recommended and actual treatment practices by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age, and calendar time for a wide range of bladder cancer treatment recommendations. Future quality improvement efforts may build upon the results to target the treatment gaps with the greatest potential to reduce disparities and improve care delivery and patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among men and the thirteenth among women, and it is the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in recurrence, progression, and mortality have been reported across different patient groups and may be due in part to variability in treatment use. We will compare recommended and actual treatment practices for bladder cancer by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age in order to elucidate treatment gaps and disparities, with the underlying goal of informing future quality improvement efforts to improve care delivery and reduce disparities.                ",Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment,8692201,R21CA185931,"['21 year old', 'Adherence', 'African American', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Appointment', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Calendar', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cytology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intravesical Administration', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Time', 'Transurethral Resection', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Urologist', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'intravesical', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'older patient', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'treatment adherence', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2014,184295,111231681,0.03201544036407185
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.            ",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8690410,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198849,533594881,0.060024051266454326
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.            ",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8681246,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'PC3 cell line', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,201953,685608202,0.004886471869116165
"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.         The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,758431960,0.02220300968944141
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US.

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.                ",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8693710,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,504210,685608202,0.011989072065474752
"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8625722,R01CA166269,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mammography', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NCI,H.

"Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) tend to be less responsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy than ER-negative breast cancers; advanced ER+ breast cancer remains largely incurable. Moreover, this breast cancer subtype frequently exhibits marked dormancy, conferring upon patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that persists for decades after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Why ER+ breast is the most strongly associated with dormancy is unknown and represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Since 70% of newly diagnosed breast cancers are ER+ but ~50% of these eventually recur, many doing so years after cessation of an otherwise apparently successful initial intervention, significance of the dormant phenotype is clear. Using transcriptome data from pretreatment tumors from women with ER+ breast cancer who were subsequently treated with tamoxifen (TAM) as their only systemic therapy, we derived an initial molecular classifier that robustly separates early (d 3 yrs) from late (e 5 yrs; emergence from dormancy) distant recurrences in both training and independent datasets. We then identified novel features of the ""early"" (E) vs. ""late"" (L) signaling network's topology in thse datasets. We also developed an adaptation of the DMBA-induced rat mammary tumor model and show that it represents E, L, and ""not"" (N) recurring tumors, molecular features of which are present in human breast tumors and cell lines. Mechanistically, our data implicate a ""rewiring"" (including epigenetic events) of the signaling from the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, and adaptations in cellular metabolism, as the molecular events that may enable cells to maintain, and later escape from, dormancy. Our central hypothesis is that dormancy reflects the growth arrest induced by endocrine therapies in both residual tumors (in-breast recurrences) and micro-metastases (distant recurrences), and that the signaling maintaining dormancy after systemic therapy ends is epigenetically regulated. Indeed, prolonged hormone therapy may well work by extending dormancy. Individual cells can emerge from dormancy as their metabolic capacity becomes sufficient to support both survival and replication, and the integrated balance between autophagy (prosurvival) and apoptosis (prodeath) signaling enables more cells in a tumor to proliferate and the tumor population size to grow. We propose an integrated, multidisciplinary research program that, if successful, will generate innovative insights into the molecular drivers of dormancy in ER+ breast cancers, develop new in silico signaling models, identify predictors of patient risk to experience a late recurrence, and explore mechanisms of dormancy with the longer term goal of discovering potentially novel therapeutic interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast tumors expressing estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) comprise 70% of all newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers. ER+ breast tumors represent the breast cancer subtype most strongly associated with tumor dormancy, conferring upon these patients a high risk of experiencing a late recurrence (emergence from dormancy) that can persist for decades after initial diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, very little is known abou the molecular drivers that determine the onset, maintenance, and emergence from dormancy. Our multidisciplinary team will apply state-of-the-art technologies to several unique, independent, human breast cancer data sets (including matched primary and recurrent tumors from the same individuals) and a rat mammary tumor model to address two fundamental aspects of dormancy; i.e., we will (i) accurately and robustly identify those breast cancer patients at greatest risk of experiencing a late recurrence (e 5 yrs after initial diagnosis) and (i) define the molecular events driving dormancy to help develop new treatment strategies that can be targeted to these patients.            ",Collaborative Research in Integrative Cancer Biology,8685657,U01CA184902,"['Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'ERR1 protein', 'ESR1 gene', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population Sizes', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'Rattus', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Tamoxifen', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone therapy', 'human data', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'paracrine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,594425,50343425,0.0902587863360104
"(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. Muscle mass (MM) exerts powerful endocrine, immune, and hormonal influences within the body. Sarcopenia (low muscle mass or muscle wasting) and sarcopenic obesity"" (i.e., obesity and low muscle mass) are common in breast cancer survivors and may be further exacerbated by oncological treatments which increase fat mass and reduce muscle mass. In response to PQ2, ""How does obesity relate to cancer risk"", we propose to examine in addition to adiposity or fat mass (FM) alone, the effect of MM and the relationship of adiposity to muscularity on breast cancer outcomes. This will further our understanding of the ideal body composition associated with the best prognosis and may help explain the observation that overweight and (mild) obesity predict elevated risk of breast cancer, but paradoxically do not always predict higher mortality after diagnosis compared with those who are normal-weight or underweight. Recently, methods to measure FM and MM using abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) scans have been developed and validated to identify individuals with sarcopenia. In two cohorts of women (total n=3,250) diagnosed between 2000 and 2015 with Stage I-III invasive breast cancer at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DCFI), we will use CT scans collected as part of routine care at diagnosis, and assess FM and MM in order to understand the role of body composition, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer prognosis in an attempt to explain how obesity relates to survival risk. Specifically, we will examine the level of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer survivors at diagnosis and how that varies by important medical and demographic characteristics (Aim 1). We will also examine associations between FM, MM, sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, and cardiometabolic risk factors (Aim 2); chemotoxicity (Aim 3); and breast cancer-specific and overall mortality (Aim 4). Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate most associations, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality. The proposed study is the first large-scale investigation to examine the role of body composition at diagnosis and before treatment on breast cancer outcomes. This study uses a novel, state-of-the art tool to measure fat/muscle mass that is biologically more relevant than standard measures of height and weight, and could provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival. This study has the potential for high impact since CT scans already collected as a part of regular care could be used to assess fat and muscle mass with little added extra cost. Alternatively, other methods including dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans or bioelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) could be adopted into clinical practice, adding an important physiologic measure to BMI to help target and personalize weight control strategies and other treatments to prevent muscle mass loss, and improve survival. Both FM and MM have independent metabolic roles in breast cancer prognosis that may ultimately help to explain the mechanistic pathways underlying the association between obesity and breast cancer survival.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The optimal body size associated with the most favorable breast cancer outcomes is not well established. Most importantly, not all overweight and obese women are at higher risk of poor outcomes. The importance of muscle mass in breast cancer survival has not been adequately studied. This study will examine the extent of body fat and muscle mass as well as sarcopenia (low muscle mass) and sarcopenic obesity (low muscle mass and obesity) among women diagnosed with breast cancer to evaluate how these conditions influence prognosis. Study findings may provide important insight into the role of body composition in cancer survival and may lead to more tailored treatment strategies.            ",(PQA2) Exploring the role of sarcopenia in obesity and breast cancer survival,8686573,R01CA184953,"['Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Catabolism', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cox Models', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Endocrine', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Height', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mild obesity', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Survivors', 'Toxic effect', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'functional status', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'routine care', 'sarcopenia', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'wasting']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2014,629652,111231681,0.10815841476614729
"Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer prevention processes are rapidly transforming. Changes in guidelines, and resulting changes in practice, stem from breakthroughs in basic research on cervical cancer and technological advances in testing, diagnosis, and prevention. For example discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has led to         development of HPV vaccines and recommendations for their use in the general public. As cervical cancer prevention practices change, we face widening gaps in our knowledge about the impact of these changes on women's health, that is, the balance of risk and harms affected by newly recommended screening intervals, and how this balance differs for vaccinated and unvaccinated women. We also need more information about barriers to screening uptake and adherence to guidelines screening intervals. To address these gaps, we propose supplementing our Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS) PROSPR Research Center with a Cervical Cancer Unit that will collect population-based data and work with the PROSPR network to guide studies of the cervical cancer screening process. Our study team, located at Group Health Research Institute, has access to extensive data from Group Health, a health care and coverage system in Washington State. Multilevel data are available from patients (e.g., characteristics, screening dates, cancer outcomes), providers (e.g., specialty), and facilities that include both health system owned-and-operated clinics and contracted community affiliates. Group Health members represent a diverse population of patients who receive care under a range of insurance coverage programs available in the US, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to new plans offered beginning January 1, 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Our study team is well positioned to carry out this proposed work. We are already closely linked to Group Health clinical providers, and have a breadth and depth of experience in cervical cancer screening research that includes knowledge of Group Health data systems and methods for extracting information from these systems, and up-to-date methodology including study design and analysis of complex data.         Public Health Relevance:  Cervical cancer screening recommendations have undergone dramatic changes, shifting from annual Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to 2- to 3-year rescreening intervals, and incorporating HPV DNA testing. This supplement to our PROSPR Research Center will enable our team to provide population-level data to improve our understanding of the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening as practiced.                ",Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS),8791225,U54CA163261,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Commit', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cytopathology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Northwestern United States', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'anticancer research', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'care delivery', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized data processing', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'stem', 'uptake']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,649872,148927,-0.027491640610020032
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Changes in Physical and Cognitive Functioning among Cancer Survivors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to examine the impact of a cancer diagnosis on physical and cognitive functioning among older cancer survivors based on longitudinal data from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study. Public use HRS data from ten waves (1992-2010) will be linked to restricted HRS cancer data to identify respondents newly diagnosed with cancer and to form cohorts by major types of cancer. Data on sociodemographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviors, will be used to assess differences in physical and cognitive functioning exhibited at subsequent time points among cancer survivors and compared to persons with no history of cancer, to help separate the effects of cancer from the normal effects of aging. These data will be linked to the HRS Medicare Claims and Summary Data (2007) to identify extent of disease and treatment modality(s). Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to examine change over time and the association between predictors and patterns of change. This research will test the hypothesis that the diagnosis of cancer has a significant negative effect on physical and cognitive functioning separate from the normal effects of aging. We hypothesize that the risk of adverse changes in physical and cognitive functioning after a cancer diagnosis is influenced by various treatment-related factors as well as by socioeconomic and health factors present before and/or after diagnosis. Insight gained from the proposed project will improve our understanding of the adverse physical and cognitive health outcomes following a cancer diagnosis in older adults and will inform interventions targeted at addressing both age-related and cancer-related consequences to improve the quality of life for long-term cancer survivors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Insight gained from the proposed project will improve our understanding of the adverse physical and cognitive health outcomes following a cancer diagnosis in older adults and will inform interventions targeted at addressing both age-related and cancer-related consequences to improve the quality of life for long-term cancer survivors.

"Social Networks & Breast Cancer Prognosis in the Chinese and US Evaluation Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with, and nearly 40,000 die from their breast cancer (BC) but variations in treatment and tumor characteristics explain only a fraction of breast cancer deaths. It is important to determine those factors that may help prolong survival given the aging of the population and the greater incidence of breast cancer in older women. Social networks are defined as the web of social relationships that surround an individual. Previous literature demonstrates that women with larger social networks have longer survival after a BC diagnosis, but the mechanisms through which social networks influence prognosis and in what populations are unknown. The aims of this grant are to examine associations between social network size, network members (presence of a spouse/partner, number of first-degree relatives, community participation, religious participation), and 1) major behavioral risk factors for survival including physical activity, diet, smoking, and body weight, as well as 2) breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. We will consider the modifying influence of relationship quality, (i.e., levels of social support and social burden) on BC outcomes. Associations will also be examined in different populations of women defined by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, cancer severity, and extensiveness of treatment. Aims will be addressed in a pooled analysis of 10,239 breast cancer survivors in the Chinese and US Evaluation (CAUSE) Cohort which includes women from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE), the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) and the Shanghai Breast Cancer Cohort (SBCC) studies. Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate associations with behavioral factors, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality, after evaluating heterogeneity. Associations will be examined by sociodemographic factors, disease severity and treatment, and levels of social support and burden, testing for effect modification. The proposed study is the first to examine associations with lifestyle factors and weight. It is the first pooled study of social networks and breast cancer outcomes, the largest of its kind, and represents a new generation of studies to examine in a more nuanced way how and in what populations social networks influence BC outcomes, including the possible costs and burdens, and not just benefits of social relationships. We expect that influences on behavioral factors will in part explain associations with mortality. I we demonstrate these findings, family interventions previously employed to improve lifestyle factors in persons with cardiovascular conditions might inform possible new strategies to improve health and survival in women with BC. Previous social interventions in BC survivors have largely focused on social-emotional supports, but these have failed to improve survival. It is hoped that addressing gaps in the literature will help point to potential avenues through which relationships with network members might be augmented to promote survival, or managed to mitigate costs of social relationships.          Public Health Relevance Statement Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) and nearly 40,000 die from their breast cancer, but variations in treatment and tumor characteristics explain only a fraction of breast cancer deaths. This research examines the impact of social relationships on behavioral factors and weight, as well as mortality outcomes, to identify social factors that can prolong survival to inform possible intervention strategies. Given women's roles in managing family relationships and in caregiving, and the likely increases in BC rates with the aging of the population, it will become increasingly important to understand how social relationships influence BC outcomes.

"Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by lack of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and is characteristically an aggressive cancer, especially in a metastatic setting. Approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers are TNBC. In spite of recent improvements in TNBC treatment, the lack of known specific therapeutic targets and the heterogeneous response to chemotherapy make it difficult to attack TNBC and obtain a consistent outcome and meaningful benefit. Recently, cisplatin chemotherapy has regained interest based on growing evidence on achieving better outcome from preclinical and clinical data. However, many TNBC patients are not responding to the treatment; and there is no clinical practical way to identify in which individuals' cisplatin chemotherapy will be effective t avoid unnecessary toxicity and cost of healthcare.         The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, for identifying novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in TNBC more accurately and efficiently from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The recent discovery of the p63/p73 expression, p53 mutation and measurements of DNA repair status effects on the sensitivity to cisplatin in TNBC patients has indicated the existence of cisplatin response predictors and the need for further investigation. In this study, we will develo a novel sequence-based copy number variation (CNV) detection tool, using signal processing techniques; and a novel supervised integrative analysis tool, based on Bayesian network analysis which integrates CNV, point mutation and gene expression data. We will hone and validate the innovative methods and tools on publically available data such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Then by collaborating with oncologists and pathologists from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and using the Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center DNA Resource Core services, we will generate novel DNA sequence and RNA- seq datasets on responsive and non-responsive TNBC tumor samples from an existing clinical trial, which was designed to study preoperative cisplatin in early-stage breast cancer. By applying the proposed computational framework we will shed unprecedented light on potential predictors of TNBC response to cisplatin therapy that can help guide biomarker selection. We will verify the candidate biomarkers through gene ontology and pathway analyses. In addition, we will analyze TCGA data to determine the prevalence of these candidate biomarkers in TNBC.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this study is to develop a computational framework, based on signal processing and machine learning techniques, to more accurately and efficiently identify novel cisplatin response candidate biomarkers in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from next-generation sequencing data. Successful completion of this proposal will result in two important public health impacts: (1) Candidate ""response"" biomarkers of cisplatin chemotherapy responsive TNBCs, and (2) A computational approach supporting personalized medicine for TNBC. Furthermore, once established, this framework can be extended to the detection of biomarkers in other tumor types, and can contribute to improving the drug development process and the effectiveness of cancer care.",Novel integrative method to detect biomakers of breast cancer resistance,8486963,K99LM011595,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Public Health', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Services', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'drug development', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NLM,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2013,82325,178569161,0.06846873016670736
"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US. The etiologies of these cancers are not well understood, but Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a promising biomarker of risk. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of ovarian and endometrial cancer and could potentially identify new avenues for research on approaches to risk assessment and screening.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).          This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. Narrative This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"Quantitative diagnosis of breast cancer with ultrasound    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to design quantitative methods that clinicians can use to supplement their visual interpretation of sonograms for differentiating benign and malignant solid breast masses. The hypothesis is that combining quantitative methods with clinicians' assessment of images will improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies. Our preliminary study shows that certain sonographic features derived from lesion margin, shape, and echo characteristics can help differentiate benign and malignant solid masses. In this application, we propose to build on our initial success and develop a diagnostic system on an ultrasound scanner that provides the end user with online estimates of probability of malignancy from quantitative analysis of the breast ultrasound images. The program has four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, ultrasound images of breast masses from 400 patients will be acquired under controlled and well- defined experimental conditions. In Specific Aim 2, new approaches will be developed to detect mass margins and to describe these features quantitatively. The qualitative features of the masses that clinicians use in routine diagnosis will also be identified. The quantitative and the qualitative feature sets will be used individually with novel classification methods based on logistic regression, neural networks and radial basis function classifiers to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of each classification scheme and feature set will be evaluated by ROC analysis. In Specific Aim 3, the qualitative and the quantitative feature sets will be combined, integrating the intuitive medical experience of the clinicians with the precision of quantitative measurements. In the final phase of the program, Specific Aim 4, the best performing feature set and classification scheme will be implemented on an ultrasound scanner for online diagnosis of malignant and benign breast masses. This program integrates qualitative clinical and quantitative computer approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. We expect to develop a new diagnostic system that determines probability of malignancy, which clinicians could use as an online second opinion when making diagnostic decisions during the performance of a breast ultrasound examination.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Currently ultrasound imaging is used for diagnosing breast cancer by visual inspection of the images. This application introduces a new paradigm that will use quantitative methods to differentiate malignant and benign breast masses. If successful, the proposed research could reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.         The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8483561,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,324656,758431960,0.02220300968944141
"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.          Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8460774,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2013,343648,158262644,0.09708023507187881
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US. The etiologies of these cancers are not well understood, but Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a promising biomarker of risk. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of ovarian and endometrial cancer and could potentially identify new avenues for research on approaches to risk assessment and screening.

"Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mammographic breast density (BD) is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. Most research studies generating this conclusion used an operator-assisted method (applied to digitized film) to estimate the percentage of BD (i.e. PD, the standard), which requires an expert technician to outline the breast region and define thresholds. Although clearly an invaluable research tool, this standard does not lend itself to automation, and is therefore not amenable for application in the clinical setting (i.e. large-scale implementation) for patient risk assessment and management. Our goal is to lay the foundation for translating the demonstrated research value of BD into the clinic by advancing our recent achievements in full field digital mammography (FFDM), the emerging standard modality for breast screening in the US. We developed a calibration system for FFDM using a specific unit that produced four significant findings: (1) a standardization technique that makes pixel values comparable across all images, (2) a new calibrated spatial variation BD measurement (or Vc) that offered a stronger measurement of risk than the standard, (3) Vc is a function of PD, another calibrated measure of BD that is also a significant risk factor, and other important risk covariates, i.e. high correlation but non-linear, and (4) demonstrated the variation measure (or V) applied to raw mammograms (or Vr) is also a significant breast cancer risk factor.  In this proposed work we build on our calibration approach and apply it to different FFDM units. We will validate the Vc and Vr measures from different FFDM technology and make comparisons with our previous findings using a matched case-control study using both pre-existing and new FFDM datasets. Because differences in detector designs have the potential to alter spatial variation, it is imperative to assess these influences n the new V-metrics to demonstrate that breast cancer risk is not dependent upon the system design. We will quantify the gains derived from calibration by comparing Vc and Vr, because gains are derived at the expense of advanced image processing and analyses. We will determine the optimal breast density measure and representation (i.e. is calibration required), where optimal is defined by these attributes: automated, quantitative, reproducible, consistent across different imaging platforms, and offers risk prediction at least equivalent with that offere by PD. To meet our objectives, we use accepted techniques and introduce novel analysis strategies that include statistical learning to better capture the relationships between the import risk covariates. This work will provide a prescription for making the optimal BD measurement. The successful completion of this work will allow the full scale integration of BD into the clinica environment. Potential applications include personalized care of patients in terms of screening frequency, risk reduction interventions, and the identification of situations where mammography may be ineffective (i.e. where dense tissue significantly reduces either sensitivity or specificityof mammography).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mammographic breast density is a significant breast cancer risk factor, second in magnitude only to inherited BRCA mutations. To date, the best way to calculate this measurement is not well understood. However, an operator-assisted measure is often used for research purposes. Due to measurement complexities breast density is not used for clinical based risk assessments. The focus of our work is full field digital mammography (FFDM). We use FFDM because the majority of accredited mammography facilities now operate FFDM units and FFDM will replace film systems eventually. Moreover, digital images from FFDM facilitate the processing methods. We are developing a method to measure this important factor from mammograms. We used experimental phantom imaging to adjust mammograms to make improved measures of breast density for full field digital mammography. Using advanced image processing techniques, we normalized mammograms so that they are comparable. This process allowed us to develop a new automated method of measuring breast density that shows stronger correlation with breast cancer than other measures. In this proposed work, we will explore the generalizations of our novel measure and evaluate it further with different types of mammography units. The work has important healthcare implications upon completion. This project will provide a technique that can be used in the clinic to (a) collect important serial brest density information, and (b) develop breast cancer risk models that include breast density.                ",Automated Quantitative Measures of Breast Density,8436915,R01CA166269,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mammography', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool']",NCI,H.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Social Networks & Breast Cancer Prognosis in the Chinese and US Evaluation Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with, and nearly 40,000 die from their breast cancer (BC) but variations in treatment and tumor characteristics explain only a fraction of breast cancer deaths. It is important to determine those factors that may help prolong survival given the aging of the population and the greater incidence of breast cancer in older women. Social networks are defined as the web of social relationships that surround an individual. Previous literature demonstrates that women with larger social networks have longer survival after a BC diagnosis, but the mechanisms through which social networks influence prognosis and in what populations are unknown. The aims of this grant are to examine associations between social network size, network members (presence of a spouse/partner, number of first-degree relatives, community participation, religious participation), and 1) major behavioral risk factors for survival including physical activity, diet, smoking, and body weight, as well as 2) breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. We will consider the modifying influence of relationship quality, (i.e., levels of social support and social burden) on BC outcomes. Associations will also be examined in different populations of women defined by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, cancer severity, and extensiveness of treatment. Aims will be addressed in a pooled analysis of 10,239 breast cancer survivors in the Chinese and US Evaluation (CAUSE) Cohort which includes women from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE), the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) and the Shanghai Breast Cancer Cohort (SBCC) studies. Multiple linear and logistic regression will be used to evaluate associations with behavioral factors, and Cox models will be used to evaluate associations with mortality, after evaluating heterogeneity. Associations will be examined by sociodemographic factors, disease severity and treatment, and levels of social support and burden, testing for effect modification. The proposed study is the first to examine associations with lifestyle factors and weight. It is the first pooled study of social networks and breast cancer outcomes, the largest of its kind, and represents a new generation of studies to examine in a more nuanced way how and in what populations social networks influence BC outcomes, including the possible costs and burdens, and not just benefits of social relationships. We expect that influences on behavioral factors will in part explain associations with mortality. I we demonstrate these findings, family interventions previously employed to improve lifestyle factors in persons with cardiovascular conditions might inform possible new strategies to improve health and survival in women with BC. Previous social interventions in BC survivors have largely focused on social-emotional supports, but these have failed to improve survival. It is hoped that addressing gaps in the literature will help point to potential avenues through which relationships with network members might be augmented to promote survival, or managed to mitigate costs of social relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance Statement Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) and nearly 40,000 die from their breast cancer, but variations in treatment and tumor characteristics explain only a fraction of breast cancer deaths. This research examines the impact of social relationships on behavioral factors and weight, as well as mortality outcomes, to identify social factors that can prolong survival to inform possible intervention strategies. Given women's roles in managing family relationships and in caregiving, and the likely increases in BC rates with the aging of the population, it will become increasingly important to understand how social relationships influence BC outcomes.              Public Health Relevance Statement Each year, more than 200,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) and nearly 40,000 die from their breast cancer, but variations in treatment and tumor characteristics explain only a fraction of breast cancer deaths.

"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal. The proposed plans for a K22 Award will complement the strong foundation provided by the candidate's K07 Award and afford her the additional protected time needed during her critical transition phase to become an independent investigator and a leading expert in the nutritional epidemiology of female hormonal cancers, spanning prevention and survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate the role of excess body mass and changes in weight on ovarian cancer prognosis using the unique opportunity provided by the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, which includes a large population with detailed laboratory and clinical information.

"Mammographic Density and Tissue Asymmetry Based Breast Cancer Risk Stratification     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite being one of the leading cancers in women, breast cancer detection rates in a repeat screened population are quite low (i.e., 3 to 5 cancers detected per 1000 examinations). Screening for the early detection of breast cancer has been controversial from the start, but recent events highlight the need to develop and optimize individualized screening regimens by identifying women who are at higher than average risk of developing breast cancer in the near future, namely within five years. Establishing optimal individualized screening regimens that facilitate women to be screened at different intervals and/or with different imaging methods based on their assigned risk group will not only increase sensitivity, resulting in the detection of earlier cancers, but also reduce overall cost and anxiet associated with screening programs. Breast cancer risk assessment has been studied for many years; however, due to reasonably low positive predictive values there are no existing risk models that are universally accepted in routine clinical practice, in particular as related to screening and diagnosis. There is no doubt that a breast cancer risk model with high discriminatory power will enable an increase in efficiency, efficacy, and cost effectiveness of screening paradigms. We propose to develop and test an innovative risk predictor that is based primarily on computed image features representing bilateral mammographic tissue density asymmetry between left and right breasts. As important, we will develop and test this predictor using mammograms acquired prior to any depiction of a highly suspicious abnormality leading to a biopsy and/or a verification of cancer. To achieve our objectives we will assemble a large and diverse image database of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images with sequentially available images and related clinical information. The database will include three groups of cases, namely (1) positive cases that were verified to have cancer one to six years after the first available negative FFDM examination, (2) screening negative cases that have not been recalled during the period of interest, and (3) recalled and/or biopsied cases due to suspicious mammographic findings, but later proven to be negative or benign. Computed bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry features will be used to develop the new risk predictor. In addition to evaluating the overall classification performance on the entire database, we will investigate the reproducibility of the predictor's results and the relationship between predictor's classification performance and the time lag between a negative FFDM in question and the first recall due to the actual detection of a highly suspicious finding leading to a biopsy and/or a confirmed cancer. We will also assess the impact, if any, of several other commonly used risk factors (i.e., age, family history, and breast density BIRADS) on predictor's performance. A bootstrapping method will be used to compute predictor's performance levels and 95% confidence intervals. By incorporating this risk predictor with other existing risk models, we will investigate the feasibility of improving discriminatory power in predicting risk of individual women developing breast cancer in near-term (<5 years).        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination. We aim to identify women who are at high and/or low risk of developing breast cancer during the time period of 1 to 5 years following a negative examination. This information could be used for developing a highly discriminative model of the breast-cancer risk that could be then used for designing optimal individualized screening plans.                  This application aims to develop and test an innovative breast cancer risk predictor based primarily (but not solely) on bilateral mammographic tissue asymmetry as measured from a single negative mammography examination.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8247668,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2012,279830,158262644,0.09708023507187881
"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. Narrative This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution. This project is important because it will greatly increase the access of researchers to important data and materials while maintaining patient privacy. n/a",Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES,8197903,R01CA132672,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Ductal', 'Electronic Mail', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operating System', 'Pathology Report', 'Performance', 'Private Hospitals', 'Process', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'University Hospitals', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'ductal breast carcinoma', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'metathesaurus', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'repository', 'software development', 'software systems', 'systems research', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2012,304932,570146095,0.039456120535791415
"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response. This research aims to improve the efficacy of PET by developing novel image reconstruction and data processing tools that will enable early detection and characterization of breast cancer.

"Quantitative diagnosis of breast cancer with ultrasound    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to design quantitative methods that clinicians can use to supplement their visual interpretation of sonograms for differentiating benign and malignant solid breast masses. The hypothesis is that combining quantitative methods with clinicians' assessment of images will improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies. Our preliminary study shows that certain sonographic features derived from lesion margin, shape, and echo characteristics can help differentiate benign and malignant solid masses. In this application, we propose to build on our initial success and develop a diagnostic system on an ultrasound scanner that provides the end user with online estimates of probability of malignancy from quantitative analysis of the breast ultrasound images. The program has four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, ultrasound images of breast masses from 400 patients will be acquired under controlled and well- defined experimental conditions. In Specific Aim 2, new approaches will be developed to detect mass margins and to describe these features quantitatively. The qualitative features of the masses that clinicians use in routine diagnosis will also be identified. The quantitative and the qualitative feature sets will be used individually with novel classification methods based on logistic regression, neural networks and radial basis function classifiers to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of each classification scheme and feature set will be evaluated by ROC analysis. In Specific Aim 3, the qualitative and the quantitative feature sets will be combined, integrating the intuitive medical experience of the clinicians with the precision of quantitative measurements. In the final phase of the program, Specific Aim 4, the best performing feature set and classification scheme will be implemented on an ultrasound scanner for online diagnosis of malignant and benign breast masses. This program integrates qualitative clinical and quantitative computer approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. We expect to develop a new diagnostic system that determines probability of malignancy, which clinicians could use as an online second opinion when making diagnostic decisions during the performance of a breast ultrasound examination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Currently ultrasound imaging is used for diagnosing breast cancer by visual inspection of the images.

"Mechano-Visual Phenotyping of Cancer: From Onset Through Disease Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year. This translates to about 1560 deaths per day attributed to cancer - overall, in the US, 1 in every 4 deaths is attributed to cancer. In the US, cancer is the second most common cause of death only next to deaths due to heart disease. Future progress in several key areas of cancer research and drug discovery will rely upon the capacity of investigators to reliably detect, characterize and track subtle changes that occur in the tumor environment during the transformation from the benign to cancerous state. The central objective of this grant proposal is to design, develop and evaluate computational and imaging tools, which provide insight regarding the mechanical and morphological changes that occur starting with the onset of a malignancy and follow those changes throughout the course of disease progression using a representative ensemble of cancer tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. These new technologies will facilitate the discovery of novel diagnostic and prognostic clues, which are not apparent using traditional methods of assessment.  The overarching objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to investigate changes in the mechanical characteristics of sampled tissues through accurate non-linear finite element modeling based on the experimentally captured atomic force microscopy (AFM) data, 2) to increase the sampling throughput to allow automated assessment of multiple regions of interest, simultaneously, using an array of micro force sensors based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, and 3) to compare the mechanical changes, expression signatures, and spatial distribution of biomarkers in the normal tissue samples with those collected at the onset of malignancy and throughout the primary stages of disease progression for breast cancer cases. Based on successful completion of these aims, we will design, develop and evaluate a reliable means for providing multimodal decision support for performing automated, higher-throughput characterization of specimens. Finally, our team will deploy, test and optimize the updated suite of computational and modeling tools at strategic adopter sites (Emory University and University of Pennsylvania - see letters of support).  To accomplish this, we have assembled an excellent team of engineers and clinicians from the University Of Maryland, College Park and The Cancer Institute of New Jersey for this extremely important NIH project.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The American Cancer Society estimated that 207,090 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and that 39,840 women died of this disease in the United States alone during that year.

"Informatics Techniques to Optimize Mammography for Aging Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to develop, integrate, and evaluate novel informatics techniques to optimize the mammographic diagnosis of breast cancer in aging women. Women over age 65 who develop breast cancers have greater death rates and poorer outcomes. These women also bear the heaviest burden of ""overdiagnosis"" a phenomenon in which screening identifies cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death. These sobering statistics are made more urgent by the realization that the number of women > 65 is projected to more than double (from 20-40 million) between 2000 and 2050. In this research program, we propose to develop tools that will improve the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures (decrease false positives) and concomitantly address overdiagnosis. Specifically we aim to 1) develop a probabilistic computer model trained by a novel machine learning algorithm, Prediction using Logical Uplift Modeling (PLUM), that tailors breast cancer risk estimations to aging women; 2) use a decision analytic model to determine the optimal breast biopsy threshold using an important pathologic prognostic indicator, cytologic grade in the context of age, and 3) use comparative effectiveness analysis to determine how these personalized risk prediction strategies and optimal thresholds for action will improve on current breast cancer screening policies in women > 65. Our multidisciplinary team has a track record (including NIH funding and publications in the medical, engineering, and computer science literature) of innovative research that integrates state-of-the-art informatics algorithms to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Using prior experience and infrastructure, we are building a completely new machine learning algorithm, PLUM, which uses 1) inductive logic programming (ILP) to accurately learn from multi-relational data; 2) uplift modeling that uses age as a partition, and 3) rule incorporation into our probabilistic model for accurate risk prediction. We necessarily use a uniquely rich clinical data, a deep understanding of disease processes, and creative integration of these computational tools. New preliminary data presented in this resubmission foreshadow scientific success and clinical translation. If supported, this project will prove that risk prediction and decision analytic tools can accurately assess breast cancer risk, determine an optimal, personalized biopsy threshold, and provide a superior breast cancer screening policy than is currently employed in the US for women over age 65.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population. Accurate and personalized software tools that predict breast cancer risk and prognosis are needed to avoid late diagnosis, morbidity and mortality, as well as minimize false positives and overdiagnosis (cancer which may not go on to cause symptoms or death). Our multidisciplinary team of breast cancer physicians/experts, engineers, and computer scientists propose to build models that can predict breast cancer risk, determine the optimal management of mammography findings based on this risk, and the population impact of these tools for women over 65 in the US.                  Breast cancer screening recommendations are ambiguous for women over the age of 65 and poorer breast cancer outcomes are seen in this population.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"Anti-Mullerian Hormone Genes and Breast Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT A pivotal role for estrogens in breast cancer etiology has been known for decades. In women, the source of estrogens varies by menopausal status. The ovaries are the predominant source before menopause and peripheral conversion of androgens that are secreted by the ovaries and adrenals is the predominant source after menopause. Ovarian steroid hormone synthesis is complex and is intimately related to the underlying process of ovarian folliculogenesis. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is a key regulator of ovarian folliculogenesis, and we recently observed a highly significant increased risk of breast cancer associated with elevated serum AMH levels. Genetics is a major determinant of ovarian function. The primary specific aim of the proposed study is to determine if putative functional polymorphisms and haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the AMH gene and genes that encode its type 1 (ACVR1) and type 2 receptors (AMHR2) are associated with breast cancer risk. The study will be conducted using resources previously collected in the Women's Insights and Shared Experiences Study (WISE), which was a population-based case-control study conducted in the Philadelphia area. WISE included 878 cases and 1409 frequency matched controls who provided questionnaire data and DNA. Genotyping will be conducted on the Sequenom platform. The association of AMH, ACVR1 and AMHR2 genotype with breast cancer risk will be evaluated primarily using unconditional logistic regression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We recently observed a highly significant increased risk of breast cancer in women with elevated serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH).

"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal. The proposed plans for a K22 Award will complement the strong foundation provided by the candidate's K07 Award and afford her the additional protected time needed during her critical transition phase to become an independent investigator and a leading expert in the nutritional epidemiology of female hormonal cancers, spanning prevention and survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate the role of excess body mass and changes in weight on ovarian cancer prognosis using the unique opportunity provided by the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, which includes a large population with detailed laboratory and clinical information.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening). Each of these groups is defined by a specific combination of characteristics. The Specific Aims of this two-year, secondary analysis R21 proposal are:  Aim 1.) To apply classification methods to the 2006 and 2008 BRFSS, and to the 2005 and 2008 NHIS, in order to identify groups in the population at risk of lower screening utilization based on multivariable classification. Screening domains will be for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer.  Aim 2.) To examine the results obtained across classification methods, in order to better understand how best to capitalize on the potential of using classification methods to identify groups in the population at-risk of low cancer screening.  Aim 3.) To use classification methods to investigate whether content from BRFSS state-optional modules can supplement information from the core BRFSS to identify groups likely to have low utilization and complex service needs.  Multivariable classification of at-risk groups, informed by CTA methods, could enhance the targeting of audiences for the important pre-intervention tasks of needs assessment, barrier/facilitator identification, and marshalling the resources needed to improve the screening status of those groups.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests. It is important to continue to develop ways of identifying these groups, so that those at risk of low use can be targeted for screening programs and services. This research will examine how ""classification analysis"" methods can improve the identification of groups in the population who have low utilization of cancer screening tests (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate).              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests.

"Decision Support System for Predicting outcome of ER+ breast cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose an alternative, inexpensive means for identifying the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer for whom hormonal therapy alone is sufficient, and adjuvant chemotherapy is not required. Our novel approach uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract information from digitized histological sections of breast tissue (e.g. graphical and morphological arrangement of nuclei, lymphocytes, textural appearance, and tubule density), yielding a continuous image-based risk score (IbRiS) from zero to one that predicts the risk of recurrence. By choosing the appropriate cutoff value, IbRiS can be used to stratify ER+ patients into two classes: low and high risk. A low risk identifies those women who would respond well to hormonal therapy alone.  Of the 120,000 women annually diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer in the US, the vast majority will be considered at high risk of having distant recurrence (metastasis) within 10 years. Under current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, these women will be advised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to standard hormonal treatment (e.g. tamoxifen). However, 85% of these women will not benefit from chemotherapy, and yet will still incur its deleterious side-effects.  The only non-investigational tool to help better determine which women should receive tamoxifen alone is the Oncotype Dx molecular assay, which is now widely used by medical oncologists. Oncotype Dx is able to correctly reclassify (as low-risk) 50% of those women with ER+ cancers that have been classified as high-risk (or intermediate-risk) by the NCCN guidelines, obviating their need for chemotherapy. However, Oncotype Dx is inaccessible to the majority of women in the US (and worldwide) because of its high cost ($4500), and requirement that the tissue samples be sent to specialized remote facilities. Consequently, there is clearly a market need for a lower-priced assay capable of reaching a wider audience.  The specific aims of this proposal are as follows: 1) develop an image-based risk score (IbRiS) for predicting the subset of women with ER+ breast cancer that wil respond wel without chemotherapy and 2) evaluate IbRiS performance in predicting recurrence over an independent set of ER+ breast cancers treated with tamoxifen alone. IbRiS has several key advantages over molecular assays. First, it requires no disruption of the current clinical protocol since the necessary tissue samples are already collected during routine pathological examinations. Second, IbRiS has a zero cost-of-goods sold, and thus could serve as either a lower-priced alternative to a molecular assay or as a quantitative triage, determining which patients should be administered the more expensive molecular test. Finally, since IbRiS only requires a digital slide scanner (i.e. no specialized facility is necessary), its footprint could extend worldwide (via the internet).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year tens of thousands of women in the US with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer are treated with chemotherapy, though only a few thousand will benefit from it.

"Bayesian Rule Learning Methods for Disease Prediction and Biomarker Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The problem: High-throughput biomedical data from biomarker profiling studies aimed at early detection of diseases like lung cancer are accumulating rapidly. Although many popular machine learning methods have been utilized for analysis of such high-dimensional datasets, no single method has consistently outperformed others. Moreover, scientists have the need to simultaneously address two related tasks: disease prediction and biomarker discovery, using the same sets of data and tools. One way, as undertaken in this project, to address this need is to find the most accurate classifier for the disease from a given set of profiles and present the discriminative markers used in that model to the scientist for further verification. The large space of possible models coupled with the small sample size of the data make it hard to accurately estimate predictive accuracy.       The solution: This project will develop, evaluate and refine novel Bayesian Rule Learning (BRL) methods that are algorithmically efficient, result in parsimonious models and accurately estimate predictive uncertainty from sparse biomedical datasets. BRL methods utilize a Bayesian score to evaluate rule models, thereby quantifying the uncertainty in the validity of the rule itself. This novel technique that combines the mathematical rigor of Bayesian network learning with rule-based modeling opens up a hitherto underexplored area of fundamental research in informatics involving such hybrid methodologies. Rules enable modular representation of knowledge and collaboration with scientists, as it is easier to present the model and extract markers both visually and computationally. Rule-based inference is also simpler and more tractable. The Bayesian approach enables prior knowledge to be incorporated and evaluated in a continual fashion with a human in the loop. The latter is very important for refinement of both tools and models.       The specific aims: This project will test the hypothesis that the BRL methods developed and extended herein produce more accurate and parsimonious models for disease state prediction than other state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This project evaluates BRL methods and models using existing proteomic datasets for three diverse diseases - rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and the two most common cancers in the world, lung and breast cancers. Experimental verification will be performed using a new set of retrospectively collected breast cancer sera samples to evaluate model generalizability.       The significance: This project will produce: (1) a novel biomedical data mining tool for analyzing data from biomarker profiling studies of any disease, (2) methodological insights into the applicability of this tool and current machine learning methods for such tasks, and (3) new data for research on the early detection of breast cancer. It has potential to help develop new diagnostic tests for early detection of ALS, lung and breast cancers and lays a firm foundation for building modeling frameworks that can incorporate both prior knowledge and data to provide the technological capability for combining evidence from multiple, heterogeneous sources.           This project will develop highly-needed data mining methods for analyzing the spate of datasets  arising from high-throughput technologies for molecular biomarker profiling. It will generate  new experimental data for early detection of breast cancer, and has the potential to help create  new diagnostic screening tools for three diverse diseases: two of the most common cancers in  the world - lung and breast cancers, and rare, neurodegenerative Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Quantitative diagnosis of breast cancer with ultrasound    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to design quantitative methods that clinicians can use to supplement their visual interpretation of sonograms for differentiating benign and malignant solid breast masses. The hypothesis is that combining quantitative methods with clinicians' assessment of images will improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies. Our preliminary study shows that certain sonographic features derived from lesion margin, shape, and echo characteristics can help differentiate benign and malignant solid masses. In this application, we propose to build on our initial success and develop a diagnostic system on an ultrasound scanner that provides the end user with online estimates of probability of malignancy from quantitative analysis of the breast ultrasound images. The program has four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, ultrasound images of breast masses from 400 patients will be acquired under controlled and well- defined experimental conditions. In Specific Aim 2, new approaches will be developed to detect mass margins and to describe these features quantitatively. The qualitative features of the masses that clinicians use in routine diagnosis will also be identified. The quantitative and the qualitative feature sets will be used individually with novel classification methods based on logistic regression, neural networks and radial basis function classifiers to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of each classification scheme and feature set will be evaluated by ROC analysis. In Specific Aim 3, the qualitative and the quantitative feature sets will be combined, integrating the intuitive medical experience of the clinicians with the precision of quantitative measurements. In the final phase of the program, Specific Aim 4, the best performing feature set and classification scheme will be implemented on an ultrasound scanner for online diagnosis of malignant and benign breast masses. This program integrates qualitative clinical and quantitative computer approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. We expect to develop a new diagnostic system that determines probability of malignancy, which clinicians could use as an online second opinion when making diagnostic decisions during the performance of a breast ultrasound examination.

"Molecular epidemiology studies on the role of DNA repair breast cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the USA and Puerto Rico (PR). Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in PR. The DNA repair capacity (DRC) is a critical system aimed at protecting the integrity and stability of the genome. The overall aim of this incident case-control study is to examine whether a low DRC is a predictor of breast cancer and to identify whether the expression of genes that are associated with DNA repair capacity vary as a function of age and subtype of BC. Because age is one of the most important risk factor for cancer and DRC declines with age, this project will identify recently discovered critical genes associated with the loss of DRC. This will be achieved by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) to test whether DRC can be utilized as a predictor for BC risk in women of different age groups. Data gathered during the current cycle have shown that women (n=283) in PR with BC have a statistically (p<0.001) significant reduction (56%) in age-adjusted DRC compared to controls (n=479). 2) to identify whether the expression of DNA repair genes that are associated with various phenotypes of DRC vary as a function of age. It is hypothesized that women with BC have an altered expression of key DNA repair genes as a function of age. 3) To study key epidemiological risk factors for breast cancer and their association with DRC in women. 4) To develop scientific expertise in the area of epigenetics and to utilize these newfound tools in cancer studies in the laboratory of the PI. Lymphocytes of women with BC and cancer-free controls will be compared for their DRC using the host-cell reactivation assay with a LUC plasmid. Data will be stratified by DNA repair level and age group. The crude and the multiple logistic regression adjusted odds ratios will be used as measures of association between BC, DRC, and other epidemiological factors, adjusting for all confounders simultaneously. Tumor and normal tissue samples will be evaluated for the differential expression of DNA repair genes. The novel genomic, epigenetic and phenotypic traits associated with BC that will be identified in this study will provide a means to more accurately predict BC risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in Puerto Rico, and ageing is one of the most important risk factors. The focus of this study is to examine whether a low DNA repair capacity is a predictor of breast cancer and identify whether the expression of genes that are associated with it vary as a function of age. This research includes the study of key genomic, epigenetic and epidemiological risk factors for breast cancer and their association with DNA repair capacity in women. The results are already providing valuable information on which specific DNA repair genes are deregulated and associated with the defects we have found in DNA repair capacity impacting BC progression, and on unique insights into the BC phenotype-genotype relationship. This study will also provide the opportunity to the PI and students to develop scientific expertise in the area of epigenetics to use in future cancer studies. The results of this project will provide information and new methodologies to identify women with high risk of breast cancer and new ways for breast cancer screening.          PROJECT NARRATIVE  Breast cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in Puerto Rico, and ageing is one of the most important risk factors.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8066377,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2011,367538,158262644,0.09724930560352876
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"UNDERSTANDING POOR AND MINORITY WOMEN NEVER OR RARELY SCREENED FOR BREAST CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. Although considerable progress has been made in increasing breast cancer screening rates, there remains a significant proportion of women ages 40 and older who have never had a mammogram or not had one in the last two years. Behavioral interventions to increase mammography use have not been particularly effective among rarely and never screened women. Little is known about the broader context of rarely and never screened women's lives, yet this information seems particularly promising for identifying the distinct intervention needs and capacities of these populations. This dissertation study seeks to understand why some low-income and minority women never or rarely get mammograms while other similarly disadvantaged women are up-to-date with screening. Goal. The overall study goal is to describe and compare basic needs, neighborhood SES, sense of coherence and social ties among three groups of low-income and minority women: (1) those who have never been screened for breast cancer; (2) those who have rarely been screened; and (3) those who are up-to-date. The study will quantify characteristics of women across the three groups, assess the influence of these characteristics (and their interactions) on screening behavior, and determine the relative influence of individual- and community-level characteristics on screening behavior. Study objectives are consistent with research priorities of the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Methods and evaluation. Over a 12-month period, a random sample of callers to United Way 2-1-1 Missouri will be invited to complete a cancer risk assessment and baseline survey at the end of their standard 2-1-1 call. A telephone interview will be administered to 516 female callers who are age-eligible for mammography. Women ages 40 and older will answer questions related to their use of mammography, basic needs, sense of coherence, social ties and demographic characteristics. Census tract data will be used to assess neighborhood SES. Data will be analyzed using bivariate analyses, multinomial logistic regression, structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear (multilevel) modeling. Potential contribution. Identifying characteristics associated with breast cancer screening can inform the development of effective behavioral interventions for disparity populations and help eliminate breast cancer disparities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE To eliminate breast cancer disparities, new approaches are needed to better understand why some low- income and minority women never or rarely get mammograms while others are up-to-date with screening. This dissertation study will describe and compare characteristics of three groups of low-income and minority women (never screened, rarely screened, and up-to-date) and examine whether these factors influence screening behavior. Understanding factors that influence screening behavior could help researchers develop more effective strategies to increase mammography use in disadvantaged populations.",UNDERSTANDING POOR AND MINORITY WOMEN NEVER OR RARELY SCREENED FOR BREAST CANCER,7935386,R36MD005007,"['Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'American', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Censuses', 'Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communications Research', 'Characteristics', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Economics', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Social Conditions', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIMHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2010,25462,533594881,0.07696754150589491
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression. Statistical and bioinformatic approaches will be used to identify potential markers and their classification power will be evaluated. The microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will also be identified and evaluated.            Reference to Public Health (Project Narrative): Oral cancer is one of the most devastating cancers.

"Anti-Mullerian Hormone Genes and Breast Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT A pivotal role for estrogens in breast cancer etiology has been known for decades. In women, the source of estrogens varies by menopausal status. The ovaries are the predominant source before menopause and peripheral conversion of androgens that are secreted by the ovaries and adrenals is the predominant source after menopause. Ovarian steroid hormone synthesis is complex and is intimately related to the underlying process of ovarian folliculogenesis. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is a key regulator of ovarian folliculogenesis, and we recently observed a highly significant increased risk of breast cancer associated with elevated serum AMH levels. Genetics is a major determinant of ovarian function. The primary specific aim of the proposed study is to determine if putative functional polymorphisms and haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the AMH gene and genes that encode its type 1 (ACVR1) and type 2 receptors (AMHR2) are associated with breast cancer risk. The study will be conducted using resources previously collected in the Women's Insights and Shared Experiences Study (WISE), which was a population-based case-control study conducted in the Philadelphia area. WISE included 878 cases and 1409 frequency matched controls who provided questionnaire data and DNA. Genotyping will be conducted on the Sequenom platform. The association of AMH, ACVR1 and AMHR2 genotype with breast cancer risk will be evaluated primarily using unconditional logistic regression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We recently observed a highly significant increased risk of breast cancer in women with elevated serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone (AMH). Identification of the underlying genetic basis for this association could substantially increase our understanding of breast cancer etiology.

"Migraine, Migraine Medication Use, and Risk of Breast Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   A history of migraine is plausibly related to breast cancer risk, yet its association with breast cancer has never been reported in the literature. In women, the risk of migraine changes during menarche, menses, pregnancy, and menopause due to fluctuating estrogen levels. Particularly relevant to breast cancer risk, migraines in women are often associated with low estrogen states. Given that lifetime estrogen exposure is strongly related to breast cancer risk, we hypothesize that migraine sufferers may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. Additionally, evaluating the role of migraine medications is critical as some have been shown to be related to breast cancer risk. Most notably, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been observed to modestly reduce breast cancer risk in several observational studies. We propose to investigate the associations between characteristics of migraine and medications used to prevent and treat migraine and risk of breast cancer using women enrolled in a recently completed population-based breast cancer case-control study. This study focused on identifying risk factors for ductal vs. lobular breast carcinomas, and we will attempt to conduct telephone interviews with the 514 invasive ductal cases, 530 invasive lobular cases, and 469 population-based controls enrolled in this study. In order to compare invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma cases to controls, polytomous logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine will have a reduced risk of breast cancer, and that women with early onset migraine, migraine associated with menses, frequent migraine, and more intense migraine will have particularly reduced risks. Further, we will explore the extent to which medications used to prevent or treat migraine may also reduce risk. The specific aims of the proposed pilot study are: (1) to investigate the relationships between characteristics of migraine, such as frequency, intensity, and timing, in women with a clinical diagnosis of migraine and women with migraine-like symptoms, and risk of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast carcinomas; and (2) to investigate the relationship between over-the-counter and prescription medications used for migraine and risk of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast carcinomas. This proposed work will provide insight into the role of migraine and migraine medication use in relation to breast cancer risk. The results of this study may enhance our understanding of factors that are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer and ultimately may aid in identifying potentially new mechanisms relevant to breast cancer prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine or women that use medications to prevent or treat migraines will have a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality; therefore, identifying new risk factors for breast cancer is of considerable public health importance.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine or women that use medications to prevent or treat migraines will have a reduced risk of breast cancer.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening). Each of these groups is defined by a specific combination of characteristics. The Specific Aims of this two-year, secondary analysis R21 proposal are:  Aim 1.) To apply classification methods to the 2006 and 2008 BRFSS, and to the 2005 and 2008 NHIS, in order to identify groups in the population at risk of lower screening utilization based on multivariable classification. Screening domains will be for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer.  Aim 2.) To examine the results obtained across classification methods, in order to better understand how best to capitalize on the potential of using classification methods to identify groups in the population at-risk of low cancer screening.  Aim 3.) To use classification methods to investigate whether content from BRFSS state-optional modules can supplement information from the core BRFSS to identify groups likely to have low utilization and complex service needs.  Multivariable classification of at-risk groups, informed by CTA methods, could enhance the targeting of audiences for the important pre-intervention tasks of needs assessment, barrier/facilitator identification, and marshalling the resources needed to improve the screening status of those groups.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests. It is important to continue to develop ways of identifying these groups, so that those at risk of low use can be targeted for screening programs and services. This research will examine how ""classification analysis"" methods can improve the identification of groups in the population who have low utilization of cancer screening tests (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate).              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests.

"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Quantitative diagnosis of breast cancer with ultrasound    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to design quantitative methods that clinicians can use to supplement their visual interpretation of sonograms for differentiating benign and malignant solid breast masses. The hypothesis is that combining quantitative methods with clinicians' assessment of images will improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies. Our preliminary study shows that certain sonographic features derived from lesion margin, shape, and echo characteristics can help differentiate benign and malignant solid masses. In this application, we propose to build on our initial success and develop a diagnostic system on an ultrasound scanner that provides the end user with online estimates of probability of malignancy from quantitative analysis of the breast ultrasound images. The program has four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, ultrasound images of breast masses from 400 patients will be acquired under controlled and well- defined experimental conditions. In Specific Aim 2, new approaches will be developed to detect mass margins and to describe these features quantitatively. The qualitative features of the masses that clinicians use in routine diagnosis will also be identified. The quantitative and the qualitative feature sets will be used individually with novel classification methods based on logistic regression, neural networks and radial basis function classifiers to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of each classification scheme and feature set will be evaluated by ROC analysis. In Specific Aim 3, the qualitative and the quantitative feature sets will be combined, integrating the intuitive medical experience of the clinicians with the precision of quantitative measurements. In the final phase of the program, Specific Aim 4, the best performing feature set and classification scheme will be implemented on an ultrasound scanner for online diagnosis of malignant and benign breast masses. This program integrates qualitative clinical and quantitative computer approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. We expect to develop a new diagnostic system that determines probability of malignancy, which clinicians could use as an online second opinion when making diagnostic decisions during the performance of a breast ultrasound examination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Currently ultrasound imaging is used for diagnosing breast cancer by visual inspection of the images.

"Molecular epidemiology studies on the role of DNA repair breast cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality in the USA and Puerto Rico (PR). Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in PR. The DNA repair capacity (DRC) is a critical system aimed at protecting the integrity and stability of the genome. The overall aim of this incident case-control study is to examine whether a low DRC is a predictor of breast cancer and to identify whether the expression of genes that are associated with DNA repair capacity vary as a function of age and subtype of BC. Because age is one of the most important risk factor for cancer and DRC declines with age, this project will identify recently discovered critical genes associated with the loss of DRC. This will be achieved by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) to test whether DRC can be utilized as a predictor for BC risk in women of different age groups. Data gathered during the current cycle have shown that women (n=283) in PR with BC have a statistically (p<0.001) significant reduction (56%) in age-adjusted DRC compared to controls (n=479). 2) to identify whether the expression of DNA repair genes that are associated with various phenotypes of DRC vary as a function of age. It is hypothesized that women with BC have an altered expression of key DNA repair genes as a function of age. 3) To study key epidemiological risk factors for breast cancer and their association with DRC in women. 4) To develop scientific expertise in the area of epigenetics and to utilize these newfound tools in cancer studies in the laboratory of the PI. Lymphocytes of women with BC and cancer-free controls will be compared for their DRC using the host-cell reactivation assay with a LUC plasmid. Data will be stratified by DNA repair level and age group. The crude and the multiple logistic regression adjusted odds ratios will be used as measures of association between BC, DRC, and other epidemiological factors, adjusting for all confounders simultaneously. Tumor and normal tissue samples will be evaluated for the differential expression of DNA repair genes. The novel genomic, epigenetic and phenotypic traits associated with BC that will be identified in this study will provide a means to more accurately predict BC risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in Puerto Rico, and ageing is one of the most important risk factors. The focus of this study is to examine whether a low DNA repair capacity is a predictor of breast cancer and identify whether the expression of genes that are associated with it vary as a function of age. This research includes the study of key genomic, epigenetic and epidemiological risk factors for breast cancer and their association with DNA repair capacity in women. The results are already providing valuable information on which specific DNA repair genes are deregulated and associated with the defects we have found in DNA repair capacity impacting BC progression, and on unique insights into the BC phenotype-genotype relationship. This study will also provide the opportunity to the PI and students to develop scientific expertise in the area of epigenetics to use in future cancer studies. The results of this project will provide information and new methodologies to identify women with high risk of breast cancer and new ways for breast cancer screening.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Breast cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in Puerto Rico, and ageing is one of the most important risk factors.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,7938955,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2010,371250,158262644,0.09724930560352876
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography.

We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          n/a",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7935183,U01CA128526,"['Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Genetics', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Housing', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncologist', 'Ovarian', 'Patients', 'Polysaccharides', 'Premalignant', 'Printing', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computerized data processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2010,420331,329565273,0.14365869778256468

Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research.

"UNDERSTANDING POOR AND MINORITY WOMEN NEVER OR RARELY SCREENED FOR BREAST CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. Although considerable progress has been made in increasing breast cancer screening rates, there remains a significant proportion of women ages 40 and older who have never had a mammogram or not had one in the last two years. Behavioral interventions to increase mammography use have not been particularly effective among rarely and never screened women. Little is known about the broader context of rarely and never screened women's lives, yet this information seems particularly promising for identifying the distinct intervention needs and capacities of these populations. This dissertation study seeks to understand why some low-income and minority women never or rarely get mammograms while other similarly disadvantaged women are up-to-date with screening. Goal. The overall study goal is to describe and compare basic needs, neighborhood SES, sense of coherence and social ties among three groups of low-income and minority women: (1) those who have never been screened for breast cancer; (2) those who have rarely been screened; and (3) those who are up-to-date. The study will quantify characteristics of women across the three groups, assess the influence of these characteristics (and their interactions) on screening behavior, and determine the relative influence of individual- and community-level characteristics on screening behavior. Study objectives are consistent with research priorities of the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. Methods and evaluation. Over a 12-month period, a random sample of callers to United Way 2-1-1 Missouri will be invited to complete a cancer risk assessment and baseline survey at the end of their standard 2-1-1 call. A telephone interview will be administered to 516 female callers who are age-eligible for mammography. Women ages 40 and older will answer questions related to their use of mammography, basic needs, sense of coherence, social ties and demographic characteristics. Census tract data will be used to assess neighborhood SES. Data will be analyzed using bivariate analyses, multinomial logistic regression, structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear (multilevel) modeling. Potential contribution. Identifying characteristics associated with breast cancer screening can inform the development of effective behavioral interventions for disparity populations and help eliminate breast cancer disparities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE To eliminate breast cancer disparities, new approaches are needed to better understand why some low- income and minority women never or rarely get mammograms while others are up-to-date with screening. This dissertation study will describe and compare characteristics of three groups of low-income and minority women (never screened, rarely screened, and up-to-date) and examine whether these factors influence screening behavior. Understanding factors that influence screening behavior could help researchers develop more effective strategies to increase mammography use in disadvantaged populations.",UNDERSTANDING POOR AND MINORITY WOMEN NEVER OR RARELY SCREENED FOR BREAST CANCER,7884725,R36MD005007,"['Accounting', 'African American', 'Age', 'American', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Censuses', 'Centers of Excellence in Cancer Communications Research', 'Characteristics', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Economics', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Missouri', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Social Conditions', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'depressed', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'social']",NIMHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R36,2009,24900,533594881,0.07696754150589491
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression. Statistical and bioinformatic approaches will be used to identify potential markers and their classification power will be evaluated. The microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will also be identified and evaluated.            Reference to Public Health (Project Narrative): Oral cancer is one of the most devastating cancers.

"Migraine, Migraine Medication Use, and Risk of Breast Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   A history of migraine is plausibly related to breast cancer risk, yet its association with breast cancer has never been reported in the literature. In women, the risk of migraine changes during menarche, menses, pregnancy, and menopause due to fluctuating estrogen levels. Particularly relevant to breast cancer risk, migraines in women are often associated with low estrogen states. Given that lifetime estrogen exposure is strongly related to breast cancer risk, we hypothesize that migraine sufferers may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. Additionally, evaluating the role of migraine medications is critical as some have been shown to be related to breast cancer risk. Most notably, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been observed to modestly reduce breast cancer risk in several observational studies. We propose to investigate the associations between characteristics of migraine and medications used to prevent and treat migraine and risk of breast cancer using women enrolled in a recently completed population-based breast cancer case-control study. This study focused on identifying risk factors for ductal vs. lobular breast carcinomas, and we will attempt to conduct telephone interviews with the 514 invasive ductal cases, 530 invasive lobular cases, and 469 population-based controls enrolled in this study. In order to compare invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma cases to controls, polytomous logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine will have a reduced risk of breast cancer, and that women with early onset migraine, migraine associated with menses, frequent migraine, and more intense migraine will have particularly reduced risks. Further, we will explore the extent to which medications used to prevent or treat migraine may also reduce risk. The specific aims of the proposed pilot study are: (1) to investigate the relationships between characteristics of migraine, such as frequency, intensity, and timing, in women with a clinical diagnosis of migraine and women with migraine-like symptoms, and risk of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast carcinomas; and (2) to investigate the relationship between over-the-counter and prescription medications used for migraine and risk of invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast carcinomas. This proposed work will provide insight into the role of migraine and migraine medication use in relation to breast cancer risk. The results of this study may enhance our understanding of factors that are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer and ultimately may aid in identifying potentially new mechanisms relevant to breast cancer prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine or women that use medications to prevent or treat migraines will have a reduced risk of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality; therefore, identifying new risk factors for breast cancer is of considerable public health importance.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  We hypothesize that women with a history of migraine or women that use medications to prevent or treat migraines will have a reduced risk of breast cancer.

"Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Early diagnosis through screening mammography is the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer. While mammography is inexpensive, the interventional procedures that result from detected abnormalities (both false and true positives) increase the cost of this population-based screening program significantly. In fact, breast biopsy actually delivers a benign result in over 80% of cases making it the most costly per capita component of a breast cancer screening program. If a mammogram reports a suspicious finding, then a biopsy is required to decide whether an abnormality is in fact a breast cancer. A false positive mammogram exposes the patient to the anxiety, pain, and possible complications while the health care system bears the cost of potentially unnecessary biopsies. Our previous research has developed a probabilistic computer model called the Mammography Bayesian Network (MBN) that calculates the risk of breast disease based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. The objective of this research is to optimize the biopsy decisions for breast-cancer patients such that the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer is improved while unnecessary invasive procedures are minimized. We will calibrate our previously developed MBN, to accurately calculate the risk of breast cancer based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. We will use Markov decision processes, an advanced decision analysis technique that is used for decision- making under uncertainty, to find the optimal probability thresholds for the decision to perform breast biopsy for patients with different age groups. We will determine whether these optimal probability thresholds change with patient age.  Relevance of this research to Public Health: The proposed research will improve the interpretation of screening mammography, the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer, which affects millions of women in the US. Any improvement in screening mammography will reduce the costs of unnecessary biopsies to the society. n/a",Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making,7559005,R21CA129393,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Patient', 'Computer Simulation', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Skin Cancer', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'age group', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'population based', 'programs']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2009,153320,338121506,0.020995386858501223
"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions.

"Optimization of PET Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that is capable of imaging biochemical processes in humans or animals through the use of radioactive tracers. PET/CT with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is increasingly being used for staging, restaging and treatment monitoring for cancer patients with different types of tumors. However, current FDG-PET provides a low sensitivity to detect micrometastases and small tumor infiltrated lymph nodes. The goal of this project is to improve the efficacy of PET imaging through the development of novel image reconstruction methods and data analysis tools. During the current funding period, we have developed a method for tuning reconstruction algorithm based on the noise characteristics in measured patient data. This patient-adaptive reconstruction algorithm has been validated using computer simulations and phantom experiments. In the next phase of the project, we will implement the patient-adaptive algorithm on clinical PET scanners and validate the method using patient data. We will further expand the capability of PET imaging by developing novel methods to utilize the anatomical information provided by PET/CT scanners and by exploring the potential of dynamic PET for cancer detection and staging. The four specific aims of the project are (1) To implement the patient-adaptive MAP reconstruction on clinical scanners and to validate the algorithm using breast cancer patients; (2) To develop a novel approach to PET image reconstruction using anatomical information; (3) To develop statistically efficient image reconstruction methods for dynamic PET; (4) To identify spatial-temporal features in dynamic PET image for detection and characterization of breast cancer and to evaluate the performance using breast cancer patient data. The first aim is an important step towards translating image reconstruction technology development into patient health care. Once validated using breast cancer patients, the method is readily applicable to imaging other types of tumors. The second to the fourth aims will greatly enhance the capability of PET by taking advantage of the recent advances in instrumentation (wide availability of PET/CT) and the dynamic nature of PET imaging. We expect the new methods to be developed will be able to extract clinically relevant features from dynamic PET for detecting small tumors and characterizing the malignancy of primary tumors. All the results will be validated using breast cancer patient data with histologically verified ground truth. The success of this research will have a significant and positive impact on the management of patients with breast cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique that can detect cancer and monitor treatment response.

"Quantitative diagnosis of breast cancer with ultrasound    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to design quantitative methods that clinicians can use to supplement their visual interpretation of sonograms for differentiating benign and malignant solid breast masses. The hypothesis is that combining quantitative methods with clinicians' assessment of images will improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce the number of false positive or unnecessary biopsies. Our preliminary study shows that certain sonographic features derived from lesion margin, shape, and echo characteristics can help differentiate benign and malignant solid masses. In this application, we propose to build on our initial success and develop a diagnostic system on an ultrasound scanner that provides the end user with online estimates of probability of malignancy from quantitative analysis of the breast ultrasound images. The program has four specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, ultrasound images of breast masses from 400 patients will be acquired under controlled and well- defined experimental conditions. In Specific Aim 2, new approaches will be developed to detect mass margins and to describe these features quantitatively. The qualitative features of the masses that clinicians use in routine diagnosis will also be identified. The quantitative and the qualitative feature sets will be used individually with novel classification methods based on logistic regression, neural networks and radial basis function classifiers to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic performance of each classification scheme and feature set will be evaluated by ROC analysis. In Specific Aim 3, the qualitative and the quantitative feature sets will be combined, integrating the intuitive medical experience of the clinicians with the precision of quantitative measurements. In the final phase of the program, Specific Aim 4, the best performing feature set and classification scheme will be implemented on an ultrasound scanner for online diagnosis of malignant and benign breast masses. This program integrates qualitative clinical and quantitative computer approaches for breast cancer diagnosis. We expect to develop a new diagnostic system that determines probability of malignancy, which clinicians could use as an online second opinion when making diagnostic decisions during the performance of a breast ultrasound examination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US. Currently ultrasound imaging is used for diagnosing breast cancer by visual inspection of the images.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,7834884,R01MD004598,"['Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2009,371250,158262644,0.09724930560352876
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast.

"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          n/a",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7691340,U01CA128526,"['Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Genetics', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Housing', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncologist', 'Ovarian', 'Patients', 'Polysaccharides', 'Premalignant', 'Printing', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computerized data processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2009,422836,329565273,0.14365869778256468
"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           n/a",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7681241,U01CA117478,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cloning', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epitopes', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Nature', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Planet Mars', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Study of serum', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Urban Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'antigen binding', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnosis standard', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2009,702169,59298088,0.07742107023345284
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

Despite the introduction of other SERMs and aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen is still widely used and is expected to continue being widely used in important subgroups of breast cancer patients worldwide in the next decade. Many studies have consistently shown that long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine corpus cancer. The association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics of subsequent uterine corpus cancers and ultimate survival is less clear and deserves further investigation in larger studies. In addition, knowledge on effect modification by recency of use, body mass index and hormonal replacement therapy is limited. Given the fact that the survival after uterine corpus cancer is generally good, individual studies lack statistical power to examine the effect of tamoxifen on uterine corpus cancer-specific survival. Pooling of data from previous studies will allow examination of cause- specific survival of patients with a uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen with sufficient statistical power and is therefore of great importance. In addition, a combined dataset provides the opportunity to study the effect of tamoxifen in combination with other risk factors. This project involves pooled analyses of data from studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer. The specific aims of these analyses are: 1. To examine the association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics and survival of subsequent uterine corpus cancer; 2. To examine the precise nature of the duration-response curve for longer durations of tamoxifen use and effect modification by recency of use, weight and hormonal replacement therapy. From the studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer performed in recent years we selected the three largest published (100 cases or more) population-based case-control studies in which follow-up data (after uterine corpus cancer diagnosis, including cause of death), data on stage and histology of uterine corpus cancer as well as data on duration and recency of tamoxifen use, weight and use of hormonal replacement therapy were collected. Data from all patients with uterine corpus cancer after breast cancer in the three studies will be combined in one dataset, which will include about 1900 patients. Data from cases with matched controls in the three studies will be combined in a separate dataset, which will include about 1400 cases and 2600 controls. Data on grade and stage of the uterine corpus cancer were collected for part of the cases. For cases with missing data additional data will be collected and for part of the cases additional follow-up data (including cause of death) will also be collected. Cox regression and conditional logistic regression will be used for the analyses of the final combined datasets.              n/a",Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast,7500035,R03CA130108,"['Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Body mass index', 'Body of uterus', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease regression', 'Endocrine', 'Endometrioid Carcinoma', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Uterine Corpus Carcinosarcoma', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'response']",NCI,NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2008,54734,0,0.09512700814827675
"Disruption in Primary Care for Comorbid Conditions after Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):   Background: Many women with breast cancer also cope with other comorbid conditions. They must navigate through a complex and mostly uncoordinated health care system to ensure all their needs are met. The result is that some patients may leave the primary care orbit once breast cancer is diagnosed, disrupting continuity of care for non-cancer conditions. Low income women may be more vulnerable to such disruption. Studies have shown more than one-third to one-half of deaths among breast cancer patients can be attributable to non cancer   causes. However, to our knowledge, no data have been presented to show the quality of care for comorbid conditions in a primary care setting received by women after breast cancer diagnosis. We propose to examine whether the continuing involvement from a patient's usual primary care providers makes a difference. If patterns of primary care are found to be associated with quality of care for comorbid conditions, future research, interventions, and educational programs can be devised.   Objectives: Proposed is a 2-year study that will utilize existing datasets originally assembled for a NCI-funded study that focuses on patterns of cancer treatment and survival outcomes for North Carolina Medicaid recipients diagnosed with breast cancer. Our main objectives are (1) to assess the patterns of primary care continuity; and (2) to examine the relationship between the primary care continuity and quality of care for three comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and congestive heart failure). Specific Aims: We will report the primary care function performed by primary care physicians vs. oncologists across the care continuum: starting with usual patterns of health care established during the 12-month period before cancer diagnosis, during the 12-month period of initial cancer treatment, and the 12-month cancer follow-up period. We will measure the use of recommended preventive services and medication adherence as quality indicators of primary care. We will operationally define continuity and disruption. Three hypotheses will be tested: (1) Patients with comorbid conditions will experience significant disruption in the continuity of seeing their primary care providers after being diagnosed with breast cancer. (2) Such disruption in primary care is associated with sub-optimal management of comorbid conditions. (3) Cancer diagnosis is independently associated with sub-optimal management of a comorbidity, regardless of any patterns in primary care continuity.  Study Design: A retrospective cohort of Medicaid-enrolled women will be selected for each comorbid   condition. The data for each individual will be followed for a minimum of 3 years. For each comorbid disease group, 2 subgroups will be created: 1 with newly diagnosed breast cancer (the study group) and 1 without any cancer diagnosis (the control group). We will utilize a propensity score matching technique to minimize the selection bias between the breast cancer group and the non-cancer group. Logistic regression and survival analysis will be employed for statistical analysis.          n/a",Disruption in Primary Care for Comorbid Conditions after Breast Cancer Diagnosis,7450968,R03HS016901,[' '],AHRQ,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2008,57422,134382703,0.08656006780395918
"Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Breast Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project is aimed at evaluating the contribution of mitochondrial haplogroups to breast cancer risk, and any modification of this risk by body mass index (BMI), circulating antioxidant levels, alcohol consumption, or cigarette smoking. This study will use a case-control design nested within the Nurses' Health Study. 1834 breast cancer cases (diagnosed between blood draw in 1989-90 and June 1, 2004) and 3051 matched controls have had DNA extracted and available for use. Eight mitochondrial SNPs will be genotyped to classify the participants into nine common haplogroups. Associations between haplogroups and breast cancer risk will be evaluated using logistic regression. As BMI, circulating antioxidant levels, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking have all been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress, modification of any associations between mitochondrial haplogroups and breast cancer risk by these exposures will be evaluated using statistical modeling and likelihood ratio tests. The prospective nature and size of the Nurses' Health Study provide a unique and powerful resource for studying gene and environment interactions. Examining the mitochondrial genome and the interaction between inherited mitochondrial factors and environmental exposures are very novel approaches to breast cancer susceptibility. Any associations observed will provide new and exciting avenues of breast cancer research and treatment, hopefully lowering breast cancer morbidity and mortality. This project will examine a novel breast cancer susceptibility marker, the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondria are the cell's power plant, and as such, generate many toxic substances which are implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cancers. Further understanding of the importance of inherited mitochondrial variation on breast cancer risk will aid future research in screening and treatment to lower the burden of breast cancer, making it very relevant to public health.          n/a",Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Breast Cancer Risk,7456348,R03CA130050,"['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Cold Climate', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electron Transport', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplogroup', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Range', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'day', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'gene environment interaction', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mitochondrial genome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prospective', 'size', 'steroid hormone', 'sugar']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2008,87500,327644200,0.13542820882672393
"Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite their potential to reduce cancer burden through early detection, the effectiveness of screening programs is often undermined by systems-based factors and human factors. The broad aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a computer-based technology called TRACS to monitor the process of cancer screening in individual patients and intervene as necessary to ensure that the screening is conducted reliably and effectively. Interventions in TRACS consist of reliable notifications to clinicians and/or patients. However, unlike many other reminder systems, TRACS continues to monitor the care of the patient subsequent to the notification.       In this phase of the application, TRACS will be used to address the reliability of follow up of abnormal or equivocal results from screening mammography for breast cancer. A knowledge module will be created in TRACS knowledge base for the monitoring of the follow up of abnormal screening mammograms. A knowledge module comprises the process definition that specifies the appropriate course of actions for a clinical scenario and logical rules for making decisions within the process. In the next phase, additional knowledge modules will be included for comprehensive support for screening of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colon cancer.       An important feature of TRACS will be the ability to extract information from clinical text documents using a natural language processing engine called HITex. Reports of several cancer screening tests, such as mammography, cervical smear, and colonoscopy, are in the form of text documents. Thus it is important to be able to extract relevant information from these documents for use by TRACS. HITex will be customized to extract the recommendations of the radiologist from screening mammogram reports. Specifically, it will extract whether the radiologist recommends a non-routine follow up. If that is the case, HITex will extract the recommended follow up (e.g., diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or needle biopsy).       TRACS will be deployed and evaluated at the New England Medical Center (NEMC), a large urban medical center in Boston. The first step in the evaluation will be to confirm that information from screening mammogram reports from NEMC can be extracted accurately by HITex. During this phase, the TRACS software and the abnormal mammography follow up knowledge module will be tested in a simulated setting at NEMC. The tests will be conducted using records of patients who had previously undergone screening mammography at NEMC. The behavior of TRACS for these cases will be rated by a panel of experts from NEMC. In the next phase, TRACS will be deployed operationally at NEMC. Project Narrative The software proposed to being developed under this project aims to improve the early identification of a number of commonly occurring cancers. It will do so by following up reliably on the management of those patients that have abnormal results in cancer screening tests.          n/a",Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System,7481710,R43CA134042,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Boston', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Closure', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mammography', 'Medical center', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Puncture biopsy', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Schedule', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Simulate', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer generated', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCI,U.S. CARELINK,R43,2008,122518,0,0.02656885768012174
"Computer-Aided Detection for MRI Breast Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design, develop and implement a computer-aided detection system for integrating multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities for EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS, using structural, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Incorporation of morphological and parametric information from structural and DCE MRI data leads to notable improvements in both sensitivity and specificity. However, sensitivity remains suboptimal, particularly for screening purposes. By incorporating additional contrast information derived from DW images and MRS data, further improvements in detection accuracy are expected. A hierarchical set of algorithms will be implemented, using a combination of static feature descriptors, neural networks, and decision tree analysis to integrate the multimodality data.       Early detection of breast cancer is an extremely active area of research, driven by the mediocrity of current mammographic screening methodologies and the consequent expense and inconvenience of unnecessary biopsies of breast lesions ultimately identified as benign. Dr. Schabel will apply his strong background in computational simulation and modeling, spectroscopic data analysis, and image processing toward the detection system described above while developing MRI expertise. Concomitantly he will test and develop appropriate methodologies for application of our new Siemens 3T MRI system. With the significant benefits in signal-to-noise to be gained from using the 3T system, it is likely that this will develop into a fertile area for future work in screening and early detection.       The University of Utah provides a unique constellation of resources for this project. UCAIR has faculty and staff with extensive practical experience with all proposed MRI modalities, and is equipped with cutting edge MRI instrumentation. A group of high-risk breast cancer patients willing to participate in clinical trials is already in place at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, forming a body of prospective participants for the clinical work proposed. Finally, the close participation of clinical radiologists with Dr. Schabel will significantly facilitate the algorithmic work by providing the knowledge and expertise in interpreting radiologic images against which algorithms will be tested.            n/a",Computer-Aided Detection for MRI Breast Screening,7482366,K25EB005077,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRCA2 Mutation', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Diffusion weighted imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Excision', 'Faculty', 'Family history of', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Female', 'Fibroadenoma', 'Film', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institutes', 'Intraductal Hyperplasia', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammography', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Premenopause', 'Protons', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Today', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast lesion', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'lobular breast carcinoma in situ', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mastitis', 'neoplastic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'stem', 'technique development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K25,2008,168996,228951281,0.04442699154960402
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          n/a",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7391203,R21CA127169,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Digital Mammography', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genetic Programming', 'Gold', 'High Risk Woman', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Office Visits', 'Palpable', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Plague', 'Population', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Radiation', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'age group', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'cost', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'older women', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2008,169783,570146095,0.11401331790792202
"Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Early diagnosis through screening mammography is the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer. While mammography is inexpensive, the interventional procedures that result from detected abnormalities (both false and true positives) increase the cost of this population-based screening program significantly. In fact, breast biopsy actually delivers a benign result in over 80% of cases making it the most costly per capita component of a breast cancer screening program. If a mammogram reports a suspicious finding, then a biopsy is required to decide whether an abnormality is in fact a breast cancer. A false positive mammogram exposes the patient to the anxiety, pain, and possible complications while the health care system bears the cost of potentially unnecessary biopsies. Our previous research has developed a probabilistic computer model called the Mammography Bayesian Network (MBN) that calculates the risk of breast disease based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. The objective of this research is to optimize the biopsy decisions for breast-cancer patients such that the early diagnosis of invasive breast cancer is improved while unnecessary invasive procedures are minimized. We will calibrate our previously developed MBN, to accurately calculate the risk of breast cancer based on demographic risk factors and mammography findings. We will use Markov decision processes, an advanced decision analysis technique that is used for decision- making under uncertainty, to find the optimal probability thresholds for the decision to perform breast biopsy for patients with different age groups. We will determine whether these optimal probability thresholds change with patient age.  Relevance of this research to Public Health: The proposed research will improve the interpretation of screening mammography, the most effective means of decreasing the death rate from breast cancer, which affects millions of women in the US. Any improvement in screening mammography will reduce the costs of unnecessary biopsies to the society.          n/a",Using Markov Decision Processes to Optimize Breast Biopsy Decision Making,7385606,R21CA129393,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Patient', 'Computer Simulation', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Invasive', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Skin Cancer', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'age group', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'programs']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,185293,338121506,0.020995386858501223
"Copy Number Variation Associated with Sporadic Breast Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Accurately estimating individualized probability of developing breast cancer over time is clinically useful for early detection and prevention. InterGenetics Incorporated has developed OncoVue(R), a model incorporating multiple, commonly occurring genetic variants and personal history information, to estimate age-specific risk of developing sporadic breast cancer. This model consisting of 22 SNPs in 19 genes and several epidemiological risk factors was developed utilizing multivariate logistic regression analysis on a geographically diverse large case-control dataset (training set) genotyped for a comprehensive panel of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known or highly likely to influence tumorigenesis. Using a number of measures of performance applied to both the training set and two independent test sets, OncoVue exhibited improved performance in identifying women that are truly at higher risk for breast cancer (previously diagnosed breast cancer cases) compared to the widely utilized Gail model. Although the current model has improved clinical utility, our long-term goal is to continue to refine OncoVue by identifying and incorporating additional novel genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk. Approximately 10% of the SNP polymorphisms examined in our original cancer-related candidate SNP panel were not included in building the OncoVue model because they were out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls. Recently, it has become clear that most of these candidate gene polymorphisms that proved technically challenging occur in copy number variable (CNV) regions of the genome. This widespread and newly discovered source of genetic variation encompasses regions of DNA that can range in size from thousands to millions of base pairs. Genome wide analyses show that ~12% of the human genome exhibits CNV and that ~10% of gene containing regions are subject to CNV. CNV can make a substantial contribution to differences between individuals with a significant number of genes present in three or more copies per genome, in contrast to the conventional two copies per genome. Furthermore, recently published studies on the candidate gene SULT1A1 clearly demonstrated that CNV underlies observed individual variation in enzymatic activity in vivo. Thus, CNVs represent an important and novel source of genetic variation with strong potential for association with predisposition to developing complex diseases such as breast cancer. The proposed research will investigate genomic CNV in candidate genes known or likely to have a role in breast cancer development with the long-term goal of utilizing newly discovered associations to improve the ability of OncoVue to estimate individualized risk. We propose the following specific aims for this Phase I project: (1) To complete a pilot study to determine the frequency of occurrence of CNV across 20 candidate genes. We will examine these candidate genes for CNV in DNAs from 120 individuals consisting of 40 Caucasian, 40 African-American and 40 Hispanic cancer-free women enrolled in our current studies. (2) To determine if CNV in selected candidates is associated with breast cancer risk. Candidate genes identified in Aim 1 with CNV at a frequency of e1% will be examined in breast cancer cases and cancer-free controls from our existing larger case-control study. Potential associations will be investigated in a multiethnic panel including Caucasian (500 Ca/500 Co), African American (250 Ca/250 Co) and Hispanic (100 Ca/ 100 Co) samples representing a randomly generated subset of our larger study. The successful completion of this Phase I study has the potential to discover novel associations of CNV with susceptibility to developing breast cancer. In Phase II, we will be poised to expand these studies to genotype our larger case-control collection and incorporate associations with these novel polymorphisms into the next generation of tests for risk of breast and other cancers.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: InterGenetics Incorporated has developed OncoVue(R), a model incorporating multiple, commonly occurring genetic variants and personal history information, to estimate age-specific risk of developing sporadic breast cancer. Such a model has clinical utility in identifying patients that will benefit most from preventive measures and increased surveillance which may facilitate early detection and prevention. The proposed research will investigate the potential association of copy number variation (CNV), a newly recognized and widespread source of variation in the human genome, with predisposition to breast cancer in Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanics enrolled in our large case-control study.

The long term goal of these studies is to improve and optimize the ability of OncoVue to accurately estimate individualized risk of developing breast cancer by identifying and integrating additional informative markers into the model.",Copy Number Variation Associated with Sporadic Breast Cancer Risk,7612446,R43CA136001,"['African American', 'Age', 'Base Pairing', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hispanics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Individual', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'size', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,INTERGENETICS INCORPORATED,R43,2008,199910,0,0.1125604143797711
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          n/a",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7494050,U01CA128526,"['Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Genetics', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Housing', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Invasive', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncologist', 'Ovarian', 'Patients', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Printing', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computerized data processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2008,380370,329565273,0.14365869778256468
"Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single greatest risk factor for cancer is aging. While aging and cancer involve common pathways, the intersection of these biologic processes is not well understood. A greater understanding of the relationship between aging and cancer is of paramount importance given the advancing age of the U.S. population. Currently 35 million Americans are over the age of 65, and this number is expected to double by 2030. The use of high throughput proteomic tools have the potential to advance our understanding of aging and cancer, as they have recently been shown to have the potential for providing highly accurate approaches for the early detection of prostate, ovarian, lung, and head/neck cancers. These studies have garnered considerable interest and enthusiasm given the potential impact early detection of different cancers, through the use of multiple new protein biomarkers, can have on reducing their mortalities and human and economic costs. However, the promise of proteomics can only be realized if these differences are also found in a prospective setting, where samples are obtained prior to the diagnosis of cancer. Existing cohort studies provide an ideal setting for evaluating whether or not current proteomic tools can be used to distinguish between those who will and will not develop cancer. Herein we propose a case-cohort study using a subset of subjects over 65 years of age who have participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort since 1989. Using matrix-assisted laser desoprtion and ionization (MALDI) we will evaluate the proteome of plasma samples that were collected on these subjects at multiple time points. The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Baseline plasma proteomic patterns can be used to distinguish between subjects who will and will not develop breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; 2) Addition of known risk factors for different cancers to our proteomic algorithms will enhance their predictive power; 3) Identification of changes in proteomic patterns over time will enhance our understanding of aging and cancer, and improve the predictive power of this approach as a screening test for cancer; 4) Identification of the proteins that distinguish between subjects who did and did not develop these cancers will advance our understanding of their etiologies and possibly aid in their early detection.         n/a",Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons,7409617,R01CA116393,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoking History', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'human mortality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'ionization', 'men', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'tool']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2008,443168,758431960,0.0006476049582398587
"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           n/a",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7488997,U01CA117478,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epitopes', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Invasive', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Nature', 'Non-Malignant', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Planet Mars', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Study of serum', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Urban Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'antigen binding', 'cohort', 'concept', 'diagnosis standard', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2008,703194,59298088,0.07742107023345284
"Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, about 390,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide. Mortality from oral cancer is high in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 207,000 deaths per year usually after devastating disfiguration and loss of vital functions such as swallowing and breathing. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly due to often advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, prevention, identification of high-risk populations and early diagnosis are the most important ways to control oral cancer. The oral mucosa is exposed to numerous factors. However, existing preventive strategies against oral cancer have been focused on tobacco and alcohol use only. Chronic infections have been shown to influence carcinogenesis. Periodontitis, a chronic oral infection, may play a key role in the etiology of oral cancer. Periodontitis is caused by inflammatory reactions to microorganisms in the dental plaque leading to destruction of tissues around the teeth including alveolar bone. A causal relationship between periodontitis and oral cancer is biologically plausible. Surprisingly, studies assessing this relationship are lacking. Our long-term objective is to determine the role of periodontitis on the incidence of oral cancer. The specific aim of the proposed study is to test whether alveolar bone loss (ABL), a radiographic outcome measure of periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. We will utilize existing patient records at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients admitted between June 15, 1999 and January 10, 2005 will be eligible excluding children, edentulous and those with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A case-control study design will be used to compare oral cancer cases to controls with no cancer by the severity of ABL. We will use multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate independent effect of ABL on the incidence of oral cancer adjusting simultaneously for other risk factors of oral cancer such as tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of this study is substantial. New information will be gained providing insight into the etiology of oral cancer in a cost-effective way, using existing data. If an association between periodontitis and oral cancer exists, subjects with periodontitis could be screened for oral cancer as a ""high-risk population"" and survival from oral cancer could be improved by early diagnosis.

"Disruption in Primary Care for Comorbid Conditions after Breast Cancer Diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):   Background: Many women with breast cancer also cope with other comorbid conditions. They must navigate through a complex and mostly uncoordinated health care system to ensure all their needs are met. The result is that some patients may leave the primary care orbit once breast cancer is diagnosed, disrupting continuity of care for non-cancer conditions. Low income women may be more vulnerable to such disruption. Studies have shown more than one-third to one-half of deaths among breast cancer patients can be attributable to non cancer   causes. However, to our knowledge, no data have been presented to show the quality of care for comorbid conditions in a primary care setting received by women after breast cancer diagnosis. We propose to examine whether the continuing involvement from a patient's usual primary care providers makes a difference. If patterns of primary care are found to be associated with quality of care for comorbid conditions, future research, interventions, and educational programs can be devised.   Objectives: Proposed is a 2-year study that will utilize existing datasets originally assembled for a NCI-funded study that focuses on patterns of cancer treatment and survival outcomes for North Carolina Medicaid recipients diagnosed with breast cancer. Our main objectives are (1) to assess the patterns of primary care continuity; and (2) to examine the relationship between the primary care continuity and quality of care for three comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and congestive heart failure). Specific Aims: We will report the primary care function performed by primary care physicians vs. oncologists across the care continuum: starting with usual patterns of health care established during the 12-month period before cancer diagnosis, during the 12-month period of initial cancer treatment, and the 12-month cancer follow-up period. We will measure the use of recommended preventive services and medication adherence as quality indicators of primary care. We will operationally define continuity and disruption. Three hypotheses will be tested: (1) Patients with comorbid conditions will experience significant disruption in the continuity of seeing their primary care providers after being diagnosed with breast cancer. (2) Such disruption in primary care is associated with sub-optimal management of comorbid conditions. (3) Cancer diagnosis is independently associated with sub-optimal management of a comorbidity, regardless of any patterns in primary care continuity.  Study Design: A retrospective cohort of Medicaid-enrolled women will be selected for each comorbid   condition. The data for each individual will be followed for a minimum of 3 years. For each comorbid disease group, 2 subgroups will be created: 1 with newly diagnosed breast cancer (the study group) and 1 without any cancer diagnosis (the control group). We will utilize a propensity score matching technique to minimize the selection bias between the breast cancer group and the non-cancer group. Logistic regression and survival analysis will be employed for statistical analysis.          n/a",Disruption in Primary Care for Comorbid Conditions after Breast Cancer Diagnosis,7321573,R03HS016901,[' '],AHRQ,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2007,42574,134382703,0.08656006780395918
"Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For many years now tamoxifen has been the endocrine treatment of choice for women with breast cancer. Despite the introduction of other SERMs and aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen is still widely used and is expected to continue being widely used in important subgroups of breast cancer patients worldwide in the next decade. Many studies have consistently shown that long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine corpus cancer. The association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics of subsequent uterine corpus cancers and ultimate survival is less clear and deserves further investigation in larger studies. In addition, knowledge on effect modification by recency of use, body mass index and hormonal replacement therapy is limited. Given the fact that the survival after uterine corpus cancer is generally good, individual studies lack statistical power to examine the effect of tamoxifen on uterine corpus cancer-specific survival. Pooling of data from previous studies will allow examination of cause- specific survival of patients with a uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen with sufficient statistical power and is therefore of great importance. In addition, a combined dataset provides the opportunity to study the effect of tamoxifen in combination with other risk factors. This project involves pooled analyses of data from studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer. The specific aims of these analyses are: 1. To examine the association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics and survival of subsequent uterine corpus cancer; 2. To examine the precise nature of the duration-response curve for longer durations of tamoxifen use and effect modification by recency of use, weight and hormonal replacement therapy. From the studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer performed in recent years we selected the three largest published (100 cases or more) population-based case-control studies in which follow-up data (after uterine corpus cancer diagnosis, including cause of death), data on stage and histology of uterine corpus cancer as well as data on duration and recency of tamoxifen use, weight and use of hormonal replacement therapy were collected. Data from all patients with uterine corpus cancer after breast cancer in the three studies will be combined in one dataset, which will include about 1900 patients. Data from cases with matched controls in the three studies will be combined in a separate dataset, which will include about 1400 cases and 2600 controls. Data on grade and stage of the uterine corpus cancer were collected for part of the cases. For cases with missing data additional data will be collected and for part of the cases additional follow-up data (including cause of death) will also be collected. Cox regression and conditional logistic regression will be used for the analyses of the final combined datasets.              n/a",Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast,7321399,R03CA130108,"['Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Body mass index', 'Body of uterus', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease regression', 'Endocrine', 'Endometrioid Carcinoma', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Uterine Corpus Carcinosarcoma', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'response']",NCI,NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2007,54734,0,0.09512700814827675

"Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Breast Cancer Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This project is aimed at evaluating the contribution of mitochondrial haplogroups to breast cancer risk, and any modification of this risk by body mass index (BMI), circulating antioxidant levels, alcohol consumption, or cigarette smoking. This study will use a case-control design nested within the Nurses' Health Study. 1834 breast cancer cases (diagnosed between blood draw in 1989-90 and June 1, 2004) and 3051 matched controls have had DNA extracted and available for use. Eight mitochondrial SNPs will be genotyped to classify the participants into nine common haplogroups. Associations between haplogroups and breast cancer risk will be evaluated using logistic regression. As BMI, circulating antioxidant levels, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking have all been hypothesized to increase oxidative stress, modification of any associations between mitochondrial haplogroups and breast cancer risk by these exposures will be evaluated using statistical modeling and likelihood ratio tests. The prospective nature and size of the Nurses' Health Study provide a unique and powerful resource for studying gene and environment interactions. Examining the mitochondrial genome and the interaction between inherited mitochondrial factors and environmental exposures are very novel approaches to breast cancer susceptibility. Any associations observed will provide new and exciting avenues of breast cancer research and treatment, hopefully lowering breast cancer morbidity and mortality. This project will examine a novel breast cancer susceptibility marker, the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondria are the cell's power plant, and as such, generate many toxic substances which are implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cancers. Further understanding of the importance of inherited mitochondrial variation on breast cancer risk will aid future research in screening and treatment to lower the burden of breast cancer, making it very relevant to public health.          n/a",Mitochondrial Haplogroups and Breast Cancer Risk,7320200,R03CA130050,"['Adenosine Triphosphate', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Cold Climate', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electron Transport', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplogroup', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mitochondria', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Range', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'day', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'gene environment interaction', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mitochondrial genome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prospective', 'size', 'steroid hormone', 'sugar']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2007,87500,327644200,0.13542820882672393
"Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although risk for developing breast cancer at an earlier age is low in a substantial fraction of person-years lost it is attributed to women under the age of 40 who die from this disease. Unfortunately, screening mammography, the ""gold standard"" and accepted practice over the age of 40 for breast cancer detection, performs poorly in younger women and combined with radiation risk and expected low yield resulted in the recommendation that annual screening in the general population is not recommended below this age. Alternative imaging modalities exist (e.g. MRI, US), however, these techniques are not being used for this purpose for a variety of reasons. It would greatly facilitate breast cancer detection in younger women if an inexpensive, easy to use, widely available technology was available to pre-screen women and determine who would most likely benefit from more comprehensive imaging based studies. Currently, the only generally used screening tool in young women is Clinical Breast Exam (CBE). However, CBE has low sensitivity, high false- positive rate and is examiner dependent. Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a promising technology for fulfilling a pre-screening risk identification role as it relies on relatively inexpensive equipment that could be widely disseminated to practitioners' offices and it has demonstrated some effectiveness in detecting breast cancer regardless of age or breast density. Unfortunately, EIS technologies have demonstrated a relatively low sensitivity (~ 25 - 35%) when a high specificity (>90%) is required. Recently a new approach to EIS measurements has been developed and used quite successfully in non-medical applications. This new approach measures shifts in impedance near the resonant frequency when tissue is made a part of an RLC electric circuit. We refer to this new approach as Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS). The sensitivity of EIS near the resonant frequency is extremely high and we believe that using this approach (REIS) a much greater diagnostic performance can be achieved than was previously obtainable with EIS. In the R21 phase of this study we will build a prototype REIS device for rapidly evaluating (less than 10 minues) the breast and demonstrate feasibility for pre-screening women with the REIS device to determine who would benefit from a diagnostic imaging workup. This is not a breast cancer detection device but rather a risk stratification approach. Namely, the ultimate objective is to develop and test an approach that would segment the younger women population (< 40 years old) into two groups. One (REIS negative) that is expected to have normal risk of having breast cancer and the other (REIS positive) which identifies a group of women in which the risk of having breast cancer is substantially higher than in older women (40 - 49 years old) who are currently routinely screened. In the R33 phase a much larger patient population will be recruited and will be used to optimize the classification algorithm. Comparisons will be made with existing EIS technology. In this application we are proposing building and evaluating a device for identifying pre-menopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer and would thus benefit from an imaging based evaluation of the breast. This would be achieved using a low cost, safe technology that could be used during routine office visits of young women who are not screened with mammography. If successful, this proposal will have a large public health impact via increased early detection of breast cancer.          n/a",Breast Cancer Risk Stratification with Resonant Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy,7239026,R21CA127169,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Digital Mammography', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genetic Programming', 'Gold', 'High Risk Woman', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Office Visits', 'Palpable', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placement', 'Plague', 'Population', 'Premenopause', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Radiation', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Western World', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'age group', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'cost', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'older women', 'prototype', 'sensor', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2007,122148,570146095,0.11401331790792202
"Computer-Aided Detection for MRI Breast Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design, develop and implement a computer-aided detection system for integrating multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities for EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS, using structural, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Incorporation of morphological and parametric information from structural and DCE MRI data leads to notable improvements in both sensitivity and specificity. However, sensitivity remains suboptimal, particularly for screening purposes. By incorporating additional contrast information derived from DW images and MRS data, further improvements in detection accuracy are expected. A hierarchical set of algorithms will be implemented, using a combination of static feature descriptors, neural networks, and decision tree analysis to integrate the multimodality data.       Early detection of breast cancer is an extremely active area of research, driven by the mediocrity of current mammographic screening methodologies and the consequent expense and inconvenience of unnecessary biopsies of breast lesions ultimately identified as benign. Dr. Schabel will apply his strong background in computational simulation and modeling, spectroscopic data analysis, and image processing toward the detection system described above while developing MRI expertise. Concomitantly he will test and develop appropriate methodologies for application of our new Siemens 3T MRI system. With the significant benefits in signal-to-noise to be gained from using the 3T system, it is likely that this will develop into a fertile area for future work in screening and early detection.       The University of Utah provides a unique constellation of resources for this project. UCAIR has faculty and staff with extensive practical experience with all proposed MRI modalities, and is equipped with cutting edge MRI instrumentation. A group of high-risk breast cancer patients willing to participate in clinical trials is already in place at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, forming a body of prospective participants for the clinical work proposed.

"Diagnosis of Breast Cancer with Optical Spectroscopy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Percutaneous, image-guided core needle biopsy is being increasingly used to diagnose breast lesions. Compared to surgical biopsy, this procedure is less invasive, less expensive, faster, minimizes deformity, leaves little or no scarring and requires a shorter time for recovery. However, core needle biopsy provides a limited sampling accuracy because only a few small pieces of tissue (for histological analysis) are extracted from random locations in the suspicious mass. The objective of the proposed research is to design a novel optical sensor based on fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to improve the sampling accuracy of core needle biopsy. The sensor will potentially be able to survey multiple sites without the need for tissue removal and provide accurate and immediate feedback of optimal tissue sites for biopsy. The outcome of the proposed work will test the following two central hypotheses: (a) there exists a systematic and significant difference in the fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra of malignant and non-malignant (normal, benign) breast tissues, and (b) these differences can be exploited for breast cancer detection via a core biopsy needle. The specific aims of the proposed work are: (1) to measure fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and diffuse reflectance spectra at several source-detector separations from breast tissues of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery, (2) to systematically identify a subset of the optical spectra, probe geometry and minimum signal-to-noise that display maximal differences between the normal, benign and malignant breast, and (3) use the knowledge derived from aims 1 and 2 to develop, characterize and validate a novel side-firing fiber-optic probe for breast cancer detection during core needle biopsy. The proposed work has a number of clinically significant implications. The optical sensor could potentially lead to fewer follow up procedures and fewer repeat biopsies in patients suspected to have breast cancer. Ultimately, the optical method may eliminate the need for surgical diagnosis of breast lesions altogether. Moreover, this technology could ultimately be used to guide in vivo therapeutic modalities such as laser ablation. The technology proposed in this application will be applicable to the detection of other deeply seated solid tumors, and the proposed clinical studies will serve as an important database for future technology development related to breast cancer detection.         n/a",Diagnosis of Breast Cancer with Optical Spectroscopy,7213243,R01CA100559,"['Ablation', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cannulas', 'Cicatrix', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deformity', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Excision', 'Feedback', 'Fiber Optics', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Image', 'Invasive', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Needles', 'Noise', 'Non-Malignant', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rank-Sum Tests', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer surgery', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'detector', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrument', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optical sensor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tissue phantom', 'ultraviolet']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,239473,607172798,0.06358621145008365
"Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single greatest risk factor for cancer is aging. While aging and cancer involve common pathways, the intersection of these biologic processes is not well understood. A greater understanding of the relationship between aging and cancer is of paramount importance given the advancing age of the U.S. population. Currently 35 million Americans are over the age of 65, and this number is expected to double by 2030. The use of high throughput proteomic tools have the potential to advance our understanding of aging and cancer, as they have recently been shown to have the potential for providing highly accurate approaches for the early detection of prostate, ovarian, lung, and head/neck cancers. These studies have garnered considerable interest and enthusiasm given the potential impact early detection of different cancers, through the use of multiple new protein biomarkers, can have on reducing their mortalities and human and economic costs. However, the promise of proteomics can only be realized if these differences are also found in a prospective setting, where samples are obtained prior to the diagnosis of cancer. Existing cohort studies provide an ideal setting for evaluating whether or not current proteomic tools can be used to distinguish between those who will and will not develop cancer. Herein we propose a case-cohort study using a subset of subjects over 65 years of age who have participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort since 1989. Using matrix-assisted laser desoprtion and ionization (MALDI) we will evaluate the proteome of plasma samples that were collected on these subjects at multiple time points. The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Baseline plasma proteomic patterns can be used to distinguish between subjects who will and will not develop breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; 2) Addition of known risk factors for different cancers to our proteomic algorithms will enhance their predictive power; 3) Identification of changes in proteomic patterns over time will enhance our understanding of aging and cancer, and improve the predictive power of this approach as a screening test for cancer; 4) Identification of the proteins that distinguish between subjects who did and did not develop these cancers will advance our understanding of their etiologies and possibly aid in their early detection.         n/a",Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons,7243487,R01CA116393,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoking History', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'human mortality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'ionization', 'men', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'tool']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CAN RES CTR,R01,2007,306408,0,0.0006476049582398587
"Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research is dedicated to the development and clinical validation of a serum-based diagnostic test for early detection of cancer and cancer risk. We have developed a printed glycan array (PGA) that detects a robust panel of cancer-specific anti-glycan autoantibodies in sera from cancer patients and at-risk patients. Aberrant glycosylation of proteins and lipids during malignant transformation results in the appearance of specific glycan structures known as Tumor Associated Carbohydrate Antigens, or TACAs, on cell surfaces and serum components. Combinations of TACAs are always present during malignant transformation and we have already demonstrated that multiple serum autoantibodies against these TACAs can be simultaneously detected using a PGA for patients with all stages of breast cancer including individuals with premalignant diseases. Using dedicated statistical and machine learning methods, we have identified sets of autoantibodies allowing differentiation of patients with metastatic breast cancer from healthy individuals. Although preliminary, these results allow us to conclude that PGAs together with our dedicated data processing methods can be used as a tool for the discovery of glyco-biomarkers, for the development of clinical serum-based screening tests for early detection of cancer and cancer risk, and for the evaluation of malignancy status. The three key components for advancing research have been established in our labratory: (1) in-house printing of custom glycan arrays, (2) PGA-dedicated mathematical data processing tools and (3) tumor-associated glycan discovery tools. The continued research will use the printed glycan array as a major biomarker-discovery technique. Further, the combined expertise of our team of investigators including glycobiologists, oncologists, mathematicians, clinical immunologists and chemists will use PGAs in large population-based studies with the following Specific Aims: 1. To identify and validate anti-glycan autoantibody signatures of the specific stages of breast cancer disease, including: increased breast cancer risk, pre-invasive (DCIS) and early breast cancer, breast cancer progression. 2. To expand the study to the identification and validation of anti-glycan autoantibody signatures for at least three other major malignancies, including ovarian, melanoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). 3. To identify, isolate and/or synthesize, and perform preliminary testing of novel tumor-associated glycans in serum and cellular materials as cancer-diagnostic antigens.          n/a",Discovery and Clinical Validation of Cancer Biomarkers Using Printed Glycan Array,7281031,U01CA128526,"['Antigens', 'Appearance', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast Cancer Genetics', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Housing', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Invasive', 'Laboratories', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncologist', 'Ovarian', 'Patients', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Printing', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computerized data processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"CELLEXICON, INC.",U01,2007,423001,0,0.14365869778256468
"Molecular Analysis of Human Breast Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many women with small, node-negative breast cancers are essentially overtreated. For example, most Stage I breast cancers are treated with both local and systemic therapies but approximately  80% are effectively cured with local interventions alone. Separating these patients from the approximately 20% who recur, irrespective of their treatment, remains problematic. Consequently, the development of novel methods that can more accurately predict for a nonrecurrent vs. recurrent phenotype is a major priority. We address this issue in our response to PAR-02-010, for which we have established an imaginative and integrated Bioengineering Research Partnership comprising three research teams (Bioengineering & Biostatistics; Clinical & Pathology; Microarray & Molecular Analysis) from two local sister universities (Georgetown University and The Catholic University of America) and the University of Edinburgh (Scotland). We will apply expression microarray and tissue array technologies and powerful new data analysis algorithms to define the gene expression profiles of 600 invasive breast tumors (Stages I-III). Our multidisciplinary teams will use these molecular profiles and established prognostic factors to build artificial intelligence-based classifiers and multivariate models that accurately predict those patients with nonmetastatic disease (especially Stage I) who will not recur. In the long terms, the genes in this classifier and the classifier's algorithms will be used to build custom diagnostic arrays and software for routine clinical use.    HYPOTHESES: We hypothesize that differences in the gene expression profiles of tumors determine outcome (recurrence) in patients with nonmetastatic disease. We also hypothesize that computational bioinformatics can discover these differences and use this knowledge to build classifiers that predict each patient's prognosis (especially in Stage I disease).    AIM 1: We will perform gene expression analysis on breast needle biopsies of 600 invasive, nonmetastatic breast tumors.    AIM 2: We will build an integrated data processing and management system for data acquisition and retrieval, to support the data analysis algorithms to be optimized and applied in Aim 3.    AIM 3: We will optimize and apply novel pattern recognition and information visualization technologies, recognizing the high dimensional nature of the data, to discover and validate gene subsets that separate recurrent from nonrecurrent tumors. We will integrate advanced artificial intelligence algorithms and biostatistical models to build predictive classifiers that can more accurately define cancer phenotypes and predict clinical outcomes.    AIM 4: We will use tissue arrays (multiple cores from archival tissues arrayed on glass slides) to validate and optimize the performance of these classifiers in a retrospective prognostic study of human breast tumors. n/a",Molecular Analysis of Human Breast Cancer,7278280,R01CA096483,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Axillary lymph node group', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Core Biopsy', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Experimental Models', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Negative Axillary Lymph Node', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Numbers', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Puncture biopsy', 'RNA', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Scotland', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sister', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Statistically Significant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'tissue processing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,526652,50343425,0.03216737086115429
"Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, the probability of cure is very high and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect these early stages are crucial.  Efforts toward the development of early detection assays for cancers have traditionally depended on single biomarker molecules.  Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests suitable for clinical practice.  The core technology of this project rests on research from the PI's lab in which he has developed a high throughput method to identify large numbers of epitopes that can be used to identify the presence of breast cancer by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject.  These biomarkers are cloned without a preconceived notion of their function and can be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  The essential features of the approach are acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of any specific kind of cancer, departing from the reliance on any single marker for disease detection, and using specialized bioinformatics techniques to interpret the results.  The concept employs pattern recognition of multiple markers as a diagnostic rather than any single marker.  This study is possible due to a remarkable specimen bank consisting of primary breast tumor tissues and sera collected frozen at the time of surgery from 1306 patients from Detroit metropolitan hospitals from 1975 to 1983.  In addition, follow-up sera were collected from participating patients through 1992.  Interview follow-ups were continued until 1996 and data forms from patient follow-ups are available.  Over 11,000 sera have been maintained at -70¿ C at the KCI facility and are still currently available for all primary samples.  In the discovery phase, the serum antibodies have been detected by screening of large numbers of potential epitope targets on protein microarrays.  By a unique combination of techniques to enhance detection (microarrays of bacteriophage-bearing displayed tumor antigens), this study proposes to investigate a novel serum assay to detect and predict outcomes for breast cancer.  The principle is that we can clone epitopes reacting with IgG in patients sera and use them to detect antibodies in sera to discriminate cancer and healthy subjects and detect disease prior to standard diagnosis.  Such an approach should provide an early detection assay for asymptomatic women.           n/a",Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Autoantibody Mar*,7287417,U01CA117478,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Breast Diseases', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epitopes', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Invasive', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Nature', 'Non-Malignant', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Planet Mars', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Study of serum', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Urban Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'antigen binding', 'cohort', 'concept', 'diagnosis standard', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2007,683346,59298088,0.07742107023345284
"Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, about 390,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide. Mortality from oral cancer is high in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 207,000 deaths per year usually after devastating disfiguration and loss of vital functions such as swallowing and breathing. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly due to often advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, prevention, identification of high-risk populations and early diagnosis are the most important ways to control oral cancer. The oral mucosa is exposed to numerous factors. However, existing preventive strategies against oral cancer have been focused on tobacco and alcohol use only. Chronic infections have been shown to influence carcinogenesis. Periodontitis, a chronic oral infection, may play a key role in the etiology of oral cancer. Periodontitis is caused by inflammatory reactions to microorganisms in the dental plaque leading to destruction of tissues around the teeth including alveolar bone. A causal relationship between periodontitis and oral cancer is biologically plausible. Surprisingly, studies assessing this relationship are lacking. Our long-term objective is to determine the role of periodontitis on the incidence of oral cancer. The specific aim of the proposed study is to test whether alveolar bone loss (ABL), a radiographic outcome measure of periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. We will utilize existing patient records at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients admitted between June 15, 1999 and January 10, 2005 will be eligible excluding children, edentulous and those with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A case-control study design will be used to compare oral cancer cases to controls with no cancer by the severity of ABL. We will use multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate independent effect of ABL on the incidence of oral cancer adjusting simultaneously for other risk factors of oral cancer such as tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of this study is substantial. New information will be gained providing insight into the etiology of oral cancer in a cost-effective way, using existing data. If an association between periodontitis and oral cancer exists, subjects with periodontitis could be screened for oral cancer as a ""high-risk population"" and survival from oral cancer could be improved by early diagnosis. Prevention of oral cancer could begin with prevention and early treatment of periodontitis.           n/a",Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer,7152031,R03CA119262,"['clinical research', 'mouth neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'periodontitis']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2006,87280,38765145,0.061317974174988306

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,7030281,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2006,404298,533302350,0.002387788409068428
"Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-range goal of this competing continuation grant is to assess and improve the breast tumor diagnostic capabilities of diffuse optical tomography with near infrared light. Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography is based on the study of functional processes, and provides several unique measurable parameters with potential to enhance breast tumor sensitivity and specificity. The techniques utilize non-ionizing radiation, are non-invasive, and are technologically simple and fast. Tissue optical absorption coefficients provide access to blood dynamics, total hemoglobin concentration, blood oxygen saturation, water concentration and lipid content. These tissue properties are often substantially different in rapidly growing tumors. During this proposal cycle we assembled a parallel-plate soft-compression apparatus for diffuse optical tomography of breast, and we have began pilot clinical studies with the instrument at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Our pilot studies have clearly shown tumors are detectable and characterizable with the diffuse optical method; they can even be tracked during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our proposed work emphasizes hardware and software improvements, and then pushes for more and deeper clinical studies. In particular we will upgrade the source switching apparatus and detection CCD in order to improve speed by approximately a factor of 4. This will increase our spectral coverage by approximately 4, given the same measurement time. We will upgrade the breast table to improve our idefinition of tissue boundaries and increase our sensitivity to breast tissue near the chest wall. We will upgrade our software for reconstruction in many ways, but most importantly in ways that reduce artifacts near boundaries. We will continue pilot studies on normal subjects and tumor bearing patients, this time with more specific supporting information from radiologists and pathologists, and finally, we will have a unique opportunity to follow a group of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If successful, these powerful new improvements will enhance the fidelity of the breast images, and the anatomical and functional information generated by the device will improve our ability to detect and specify the nature of breast tumors.         n/a",Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography,7106463,R01EB002109,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'charge coupled device camera', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'female', 'fiber optics', 'human subject', 'image enhancement', 'mammography', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical tomography', 'phantom model', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'visible light']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2006,408037,593605914,0.024204330871538296
"Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Assessing whether items are biased against minority groups is very important for the validity of measurement scales in cancer control and in health sciences in general. Although we have scales to measure beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) that are predictive of cancer screening behavior, we do not know the extent of cultural bias. Thus, we are missing a critical component in the assessment of psychometric validity. The statistical techniques for detecting item bias are called procedures for detecting differential item functioning (DIF). Under certain conditions, two of the most commonly-used DIF procedures, logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel, can inaccurately display inflated Type I error. The primary purpose of the present methodological proposal is to improve power and Type I error of both the logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedures by using alternative matching scores other than traditional summed-item score. Using existing data from two large NIH-funded randomized intervention trials to increase mammography screening (ideal because of equal percentages of Caucasians and African-Americans), we will address these aims: (1) Using computer simulations based on the data structure for generalizing results to breast cancer screening belief scales, we will evaluate the extent to which innovative modifications of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures control Type I error inflation and improve power, and (2) Using the best modified logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures (derived from Aim 1), assess items for DIF in the two existing data sets based upon ethnicity, age, education and income in six scales commonly used to predict cancer screening (barriers, benefits, susceptibility, fatalism, self-efficacy, and fear). Improved accuracy of DIF procedures will increase the validity of cancer control scales, providing a firm measurement foundation for advancing the science of cancer control and prevention. Additionally, the findings will have broad applicability to detecting item bias in other scales. n/a",Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales,6953171,R03CA113099,"['analytical method', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'bias', 'cancer prevention', 'computer simulation', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'human data', 'mammography', 'mass screening', 'method development', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2005,59961,232986943,0.025183371894143134
"Computer-Aided Detection for MRI Breast Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design, develop and implement a computer-aided detection system for integrating multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities for EARLY DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER IN HIGH RISK PATIENTS, using structural, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Incorporation of morphological and parametric information from structural and DCE MRI data leads to notable improvements in both sensitivity and specificity. However, sensitivity remains suboptimal, particularly for screening purposes. By incorporating additional contrast information derived from DW images and MRS data, further improvements in detection accuracy are expected. A hierarchical set of algorithms will be implemented, using a combination of static feature descriptors, neural networks, and decision tree analysis to integrate the multimodality data.       Early detection of breast cancer is an extremely active area of research, driven by the mediocrity of current mammographic screening methodologies and the consequent expense and inconvenience of unnecessary biopsies of breast lesions ultimately identified as benign.

"Understand Disparities in Cervical Cancer Survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is an entirely preventable disease yet in Texas approximately 1200 women are newly diagnosed and 300 die with this disease per year. Several recent studies suggest that poverty not minority ethnicity may be an important predictor of poor survival particularly for those diagnosed at an early stage. The purpose of this project is to explore disparities in cervical cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment and survival in Texas, a large state with great ethnic, income, and rural / urban diversity. We propose a population-based cohort study of all women diagnosed with cervical cancer and reported to the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR) between 1995-2002 (N>8800 women). Specific Aims are (1) To determine whether women of minority race or ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, and African-American relative to White), those with lower income or education, and those living in more rural regions among women diagnosed with CxCa are more likely to die or have shorter survival, stratified by tumor stage. (2) To determine to what extent the differences in survival experienced by women of diverse ethnicity, income, or rurality can be explained by their treatment received, tumor stage at diagnosis or comorbid conditions. We plan to use (a) geocoded data to allow a more precise census tract level measures of socio-economic status and (b) multiple sources of cancer treatment data (Texas Medicaid, Medicare, and Hospital Discharge merged with TCR cancer and mortality data). A conceptual model is proposed to assess the role of disparities in (1) cervical cancer surivival, (2) intermediate outcomes (late stage at diagnosis and suboptimal treatment), and (3) comorbid conditions. Multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling are planned to estimate the risk of mortality and survival time, respectively. This R21 will provide pre-intervention data to identify those disparities indicators which should be the target of aggressive individual and health care provider level interventions to identify cervical cancer early and get women needed effective treatment in a timely manner. n/a",Understand Disparities in Cervical Cancer Survival,6906836,R21CA114330,"['academic achievement', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer registry /resource', 'cervix neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'income', 'long term survivor', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'rural area', 'statistics /biometry', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2005,191834,135644722,0.055422741600713095
"Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis Our previous studies suggest that gray-scale ultrasound and Doppler imaging complement one another. While gray-scale imaging can characterize masses with high specificity, Doppler imaging has high sensitivity. This application proposes an innovative integration of the two modes such that both high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. An intense 5-year multidisciplinary program encompassing three specific goals is proposed. In Aim 1 color-Doppler, power-Doppler and gray- scale images will be acquired from 300 patients with suspicious breast masses. All modes of imaging will be conducted on the same patients and on the same day. The issues related to optimal imaging will be emphasized by careful control of experimental conditions. Among other things, this will include regular image calibration and monitoring of progesterone levels in the patients to account for variations in blood flow during the normal menstrual cycle as well as for variations due to hormonal therapy. In Aim 2 we introduce new approaches for deriving quantitative features from Doppler and gray-scale images. The emphasis will be on quantifying features that physicians use in evaluating images. In Aim 3 these features will be supplemented with qualitative assessments to develop a multifactorial model for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast lesions. Novel approaches based on advanced nonlinear methods, including neural networks, will be developed to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. Each strategy will be evaluated by ROC analysis. This approach will provide objective measures to demonstrate the importance of sonographic and Doppler features and how they can be used optimally to accurately diagnose breast cancers. Taken together, this program takes advantage of unique breadth of clinical experience and basic sciences at the University of Pennsylvania.

"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens.

"Breast Cancer Risk Modifiers in BRCA Mutation Carriers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifetime breast cancer risks among carriers of mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been estimated at 40-80%. Thus some 20-60% of carriers live to advanced ages without developing the disease, which suggests that other genes or personal attributes may modify carriers' risks. At present however, title is known about such personal characteristics. There is urgent need to determine which, if any, modifiable lifestyle characteristics may alter a carrier's risk of developing breast cancer, to assist her in making rational, informed choices about such preventive options as prophylactic mastectomy. We propose to use uniformly collected data from young (aged < 50 years) case (N=425) and control (N=352) carriers of deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and five modifiable characteristics. These are: history of oral contraceptive use, history of diagnostic or therapeutic chest irradiation prior to diagnosis, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and physical activity patterns during puberty, young adulthood and middle age. We will focus on carriers under age 50 years at diagnosis (cases) or interview (controls) who have participated in an international Collaborative Family Registry for Breast Cancer Studies (CFRBCS) and in clinical studies in New York, Ontario and Australia. We will use unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds-ratios relating these attributes to breast cancer risk while controlling for potential confounders, and use robust variance estimators to account for any correlation present in attributes of related carriers. These data on modifiable characteristics from a large group of young carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations represent a unique resource for advancing our knowledge about breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women at high risk for the disease. The proposed analysis will provide new information on alternatives to mastectomy as a preventive strategy for these women. n/a",Breast Cancer Risk Modifiers in BRCA Mutation Carriers,6802330,R01CA097359,"['alcoholic beverage consumption', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'body physical activity', 'brca gene', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'breast neoplasms', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'gene environment interaction', 'gene mutation', 'genetic susceptibility', 'human data', 'lifestyle', 'neoplasm /cancer radiation therapy', 'oral contraceptives', 'radiation genetics', 'smoking', 'statistics /biometry', 'tobacco abuse', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,412786,560644462,0.117423249443136

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,6717532,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,468563,533302350,0.002387788409068428
"Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-range goal of this competing continuation grant is to assess and improve the breast tumor diagnostic capabilities of diffuse optical tomography with near infrared light. Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography is based on the study of functional processes, and provides several unique measurable parameters with potential to enhance breast tumor sensitivity and specificity. The techniques utilize non-ionizing radiation, are non-invasive, and are technologically simple and fast. Tissue optical absorption coefficients provide access to blood dynamics, total hemoglobin concentration, blood oxygen saturation, water concentration and lipid content. These tissue properties are often substantially different in rapidly growing tumors. During this proposal cycle we assembled a parallel-plate soft-compression apparatus for diffuse optical tomography of breast, and we have began pilot clinical studies with the instrument at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Our pilot studies have clearly shown tumors are detectable and characterizable with the diffuse optical method; they can even be tracked during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our proposed work emphasizes hardware and software improvements, and then pushes for more and deeper clinical studies. In particular we will upgrade the source switching apparatus and detection CCD in order to improve speed by approximately a factor of 4. This will increase our spectral coverage by approximately 4, given the same measurement time. We will upgrade the breast table to improve our idefinition of tissue boundaries and increase our sensitivity to breast tissue near the chest wall. We will upgrade our software for reconstruction in many ways, but most importantly in ways that reduce artifacts near boundaries. We will continue pilot studies on normal subjects and tumor bearing patients, this time with more specific supporting information from radiologists and pathologists, and finally, we will have a unique opportunity to follow a group of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If successful, these powerful new improvements will enhance the fidelity of the breast images, and the anatomical and functional information generated by the device will improve our ability to detect and specify the nature of breast tumors.         n/a",Multispectral II-Plate Diffuse Optical Breast Tomography,6872740,R01EB002109,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'biomedical equipment development', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'charge coupled device camera', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'female', 'fiber optics', 'human subject', 'image enhancement', 'mammography', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical tomography', 'phantom model', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'visible light']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2004,559377,593605914,0.024204330871538296
"EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MOLECULAR RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): We will expand our current      retrospective cohort study to determine the effect of molecular and histologic       factors that affect breast cancer risk in women with non-invasive breast             disease. The study cohort will consist of 12,387 women with non-invasive breast      disease diagnosed at our study hospitals between 1952 and 1992. Paraffin             embedded tissue from their initial breast biopsies is available on these             patients. Follow-up to determine breast cancer diagnosis and other                   epidemiologic risk factors will be obtained or extended through review of            hospital and tumor registry records and interviews with these patients or their      next-of-kin. We will conduct a series of nested case-control studies on these        women. Approximately 615 cohort members will develop invasive breast cancer          during 214,990 women-years of follow-up.

"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Each year, a significant number of women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer. The ability to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer as early as is possible would be invaluable for monitoring and management of this disease. As more information becomes available about the roles that different genetic, environmental, and personal health status factors play in determining breast cancer risk, it is important to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction that incorporate these factors. The goal of this application is to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction, using Bayesian networks with time dependencies, for women between the ages of 20 and 70 years. Bayesian networks provide methods for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and statistical principles. They allow for inclusion of expert opinion and empirical results from studies for a condition of interest. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop a Bayesian network based risk assessment tool for women aged 20 to 70 years, using knowledge provided by a panel of experts involved in cancer assessment and treatment research as well as relevant probabilities gleaned from the breast cancer literature; (2) perform a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the risk assessment tool developed, using data obtained from 40 patients followed for at least 5 years through a high risk screening facility (the Yale Cancer Center Genetic Counseling Shared Resource); and (3) identify the steps required for a more formative validation of the risk assessment tool on a larger study population, and examine how the tool can be integrated with other quantitative methods designed for breast cancer risk prediction, such as Markov models. n/a",Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks,6667207,R03CA099099,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' early diagnosis', ' family genetics', ' female', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2003,68483,327644200,0.1258307821051319
"Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis Our previous studies suggest that gray-scale ultrasound and Doppler imaging complement one another. While gray-scale imaging can characterize masses with high specificity, Doppler imaging has high sensitivity. This application proposes an innovative integration of the two modes such that both high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. An intense 5-year multidisciplinary program encompassing three specific goals is proposed. In Aim 1 color-Doppler, power-Doppler and gray- scale images will be acquired from 300 patients with suspicious breast masses. All modes of imaging will be conducted on the same patients and on the same day. The issues related to optimal imaging will be emphasized by careful control of experimental conditions. Among other things, this will include regular image calibration and monitoring of progesterone levels in the patients to account for variations in blood flow during the normal menstrual cycle as well as for variations due to hormonal therapy. In Aim 2 we introduce new approaches for deriving quantitative features from Doppler and gray-scale images. The emphasis will be on quantifying features that physicians use in evaluating images. In Aim 3 these features will be supplemented with qualitative assessments to develop a multifactorial model for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast lesions. Novel approaches based on advanced nonlinear methods, including neural networks, will be developed to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. Each strategy will be evaluated by ROC analysis. This approach will provide objective measures to demonstrate the importance of sonographic and Doppler features and how they can be used optimally to accurately diagnose breast cancers. Taken together, this program takes advantage of unique breadth of clinical experience and basic sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. An integrated approach in which one mode represents tissue property and the other its function will result in a systematic and comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancers.  n/a",Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis,6633789,R01CA087526,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' phantom model', ' progesterone', ' ultrasound blood flow measurement', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2003,200899,593605914,0.031565436043314354

"Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Each year, a significant number of women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer. The ability to identify women at high risk for developing breast cancer as early as is possible would be invaluable for monitoring and management of this disease. As more information becomes available about the roles that different genetic, environmental, and personal health status factors play in determining breast cancer risk, it is important to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction that incorporate these factors. The goal of this application is to develop methods for individualized breast cancer risk prediction, using Bayesian networks with time dependencies, for women between the ages of 20 and 70 years. Bayesian networks provide methods for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty based on artificial intelligence and statistical principles. They allow for inclusion of expert opinion and empirical results from studies for a condition of interest. Specifically, we propose to (1) develop a Bayesian network based risk assessment tool for women aged 20 to 70 years, using knowledge provided by a panel of experts involved in cancer assessment and treatment research as well as relevant probabilities gleaned from the breast cancer literature; (2) perform a preliminary assessment of the accuracy of the risk assessment tool developed, using data obtained from 40 patients followed for at least 5 years through a high risk screening facility (the Yale Cancer Center Genetic Counseling Shared Resource); and (3) identify the steps required for a more formative validation of the risk assessment tool on a larger study population, and examine how the tool can be integrated with other quantitative methods designed for breast cancer risk prediction, such as Markov models. n/a",Breast Cancer Risk Assessment with Bayesian Networks,6577578,R03CA099099,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' early diagnosis', ' family genetics', ' female', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' statistics /biometry', "" women's health""]",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2002,86458,327644200,0.1258307821051319
"CIGARETTE SMOKING AND POST-PARTUM BREAST CANCER RISK Cigarette smoking has been hypothesized to have both carcinogenic and anti-estrogenic effects that may offset each other to produce no overall effect on breast cancer risk.  A full-term pregnancy also appears to have opposing effects on breast cancer risk: 1) an adverse effect shortly after delivery and 2) a beneficial effect over time.  If the transient increase risk of breast cancer is due to the growth-enhancing consequences of elevated pregnancy hormones on already initiated cells, then cigarette smoking during pregnancy, through its anti-estrogenic effect, can be expected to dampen this risk.  Conversely, with its carcinogenic effect, cigarette smoking during pregnancy might also reduce the long-term protection against breast cancer afforded by a full-term pregnancy.  We propose to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on the risk of postpartum breast cancer occurring at different intervals following delivery.  We will use a database that links together the Swedish Medical Birth Register, National Cancer Register, and Register of Causes of Death.  Members of the study population are all mothers who delivered a liveborn or stillborn baby after a gestation period of at least 28 weeks in Sweden between 1973 and 1998.  We have adopted a nested case-control sampling design to allow more efficient analyses.  Cases are approximately 3,500 women who had one or more childbirths between 1973 and 1998 and who had a breast cancer diagnosis during the same period.  For each case subject, five controls who were born in the same year as the index case, were alive at the date of the diagnosis for the index case, and had not been diagnosed with breast cancer by that date, will be randomly selected from the source population.  Logistic regression analysis will be applied to examine cigarette smoking as a risk determinant for postpartum breast cancer adjusting for age, parity, and age at first full-term pregnancy.  n/a",CIGARETTE SMOKING AND POST-PARTUM BREAST CANCER RISK,6522722,R01CA088891,"['Scandinavian country', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' female', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' postpartum', ' pregnancy', ' smoking', ' substance abuse epidemiology', ' tobacco', ' tobacco abuse', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2002,93519,294146927,0.11649715014536634
"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER INVASION DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided           diagnosi (CADx) system to predict breast lesion malignancy and invasion          based on medica findings.  Artificial neural network (ANN) techniques will       be used to predict whether mammographically suspect lesions are benign, in       situ cancer, or invasive cancer.                                                                                                                                  The ANN inputs will be derived from existing, available information such as      patient history and radiologists descriptions of lesion morphology              following the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).  ANNs      are well suited for this diagnostic task because, like humans, ANNs can be       taught to perform diagnostic tasks accurately and robustly when given            appropriate training examples.                                                                                                                                    The specific aims of the proposed study are to:  (1) Develop ANNs that use       mammography and history findings to predict malignancy and invasion of           breast lesions among a prospectively collected patient database; (2) Refine      the accuracy of the CADx system by optimizing the number of input findings       and investigating more complex network architectures, and study is               cost-effectiveness.  (3) Evaluate the CADx system clinically, by developing      a graphical user interface and using it to retrospectively evaluate the          systems performance.

The immediate benefit of this proposal is a noninvasive computer-aided           diagnosis system which provides information previously available only            through biopsy.  This system can assist mammographers and surgeons in            surgical planning for patients with breast lesions, and may reduce the cost      and morbidity of unnecessary surgical biopsies.                                   n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER INVASION,6513124,R29CA075547,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care cost /financing', ' human data', ' mammography', ' neoplasm /cancer invasiveness', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' prognosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2002,108093,607172798,0.017403790779893194
"USE OF A TACTILE BREAST IMAGER FOR MASS PRE-SCREENING We propose a new Tactile Breast Imager (TBI) for early breast cancer detection intended for effective low-cost mass pre-screening. The device will build on developments made in the field of mechanical imaging (MI), a method that translates the tissue's elastic properties into a digital 3-D map of the tissue in the region of interest. It enables not only a superior method for clinical use, but also a powerful new paradigm of screening in which the patient collects data at home and efficiently transfers it to her physician for review. As is shown in this proposal, the underlying technology has been demonstrated to yield images of subcutaneous lesions that are well below the threshold of detectability by manual palpation. The proposed effort under this grant is to demonstrate that this technology may be incorporated into an easy to use form and determine the requisite skill and training requirements for robust data collection. The key developments necessary to achieve this goal lie in two categories: First is the development of the examination procedure and modification of equipment functionality to simplify the examination process. The ability to acquire sufficiently accurate data in a reliable manner depends largely on three aspects: the procedure in which the data is collected, the design of the equipment to facilitate this process, and subsequent processing of the data to minimize the effects of procedural and anatomical/physiological variations. While the majority of the necessary elements have already been developed to an adequately functional level, they are generally large and cumbersome and so would impede the ease of use of the TBI. The miniaturization and productization of the TBI probe and refinement of the data processing/transfer components is necessary. We aim to implement these developments in a prototype TBI and evaluate the resulting sensitivity for lesion detection a effectiveness and ease of use for both the clinical and home-use applications. Under Phase I grant we aim to develop an optical examination procedure, a suitable user/TBI interface design, and robust post procedure data processing algorithms to allow reliable and sensitive data to be obtained with minimal training. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The proposed TBI is an easy-to-use diagnostic tool that has the potential to effectively replace breast self-examination by health care professionals. The potential result is a significant decrease of the size of breast cancers at detection and consequently, more effective treatment, decrease in patient morbidity and mortality, and reduced health care costs. The potential gross revenues on the sale of this device is $520,000,000. n/a",USE OF A TACTILE BREAST IMAGER FOR MASS PRE-SCREENING,6443532,R43CA094444,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' mass screening', ' miniature biomedical equipment', ' technology /technique development', ' touch']",NCI,"ARTANN LABORATORIES, INC.",R43,2002,130925,0,0.02311356263486127
"COMPUTERIZED MAMMOGRAPHIC LESION DESCRIPTION   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): Mammography is recognized as       an important means to reduce breast cancer mortality. However, its accuracy is       limited, both in sensitivity (some cancers are missed) and specificity (many         non-cancer cases are referred for invasive procedures). This proposal aims at        improving the effectiveness of breast cancer screening by the discovery of           measurements that can be taken from digital mammograms, and the design of            classifiers that result in an automatic computer-generated description of            suspicious areas. In particular, classifiers for the standardized lexicon for        mass shape, mass margin and mass density, as well as breast composition will be      designed.                                                                                                                                                                 These automaticaily generated descriptions are aimed at increasing the               specificity of mammography by providing the radiologist with a probability of        rnalignancy for the lesion. The descriptions should also be helpful in               conjunction with computer programs that detect suspicious areas, by rejecting        those detected areas that do not likely represent cancer (false positive             reduction). In addition, automatic description of a marnmographic iesion will        reduce reader variability and may heip in training radiologists to use the           standardized lexicon.                                                                                                                                                     This project will first develop a segmentation program, that finds the border        of a mammographic mass. The approach will be a multi-stage knowledge guided          system. Measurements to be taken from digital mammograms make use of this            border, and include some that have been reported in the literature as well as        newly proposed measurements. As the classification problem for mammographic          masses is very difficult, hybrid classifiers will be constructed that take           advantage of specific abilities of multiple classifiers. A rule based system         will be developed to arrive at an aggregate decision for each of the BIRADS          descriptions. Finally, these descriptions will be used in a classifier to            determine the likelihood of malignancy.                                                                                                                                   The outcome of this project would be the tools to develop an aid to non-expert       mammographers to define the characteristics of mammographic masses and help in       decisions to biopsy a mammographic lesion, but can also be applied to help           enhance sensitivity through computer assisted diagnosis, and in educational          tools.                                                                                                                                                                    n/a",COMPUTERIZED MAMMOGRAPHIC LESION DESCRIPTION,6514127,R21CA082639,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' human data', ' image processing', ' information display', ' mammography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R21,2002,145000,86023662,0.01813516968852954
"Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis Our previous studies suggest that gray-scale ultrasound and Doppler imaging complement one another. While gray-scale imaging can characterize masses with high specificity, Doppler imaging has high sensitivity. This application proposes an innovative integration of the two modes such that both high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. An intense 5-year multidisciplinary program encompassing three specific goals is proposed. In Aim 1 color-Doppler, power-Doppler and gray- scale images will be acquired from 300 patients with suspicious breast masses. All modes of imaging will be conducted on the same patients and on the same day. The issues related to optimal imaging will be emphasized by careful control of experimental conditions. Among other things, this will include regular image calibration and monitoring of progesterone levels in the patients to account for variations in blood flow during the normal menstrual cycle as well as for variations due to hormonal therapy. In Aim 2 we introduce new approaches for deriving quantitative features from Doppler and gray-scale images. The emphasis will be on quantifying features that physicians use in evaluating images. In Aim 3 these features will be supplemented with qualitative assessments to develop a multifactorial model for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast lesions. Novel approaches based on advanced nonlinear methods, including neural networks, will be developed to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. Each strategy will be evaluated by ROC analysis. This approach will provide objective measures to demonstrate the importance of sonographic and Doppler features and how they can be used optimally to accurately diagnose breast cancers. Taken together, this program takes advantage of unique breadth of clinical experience and basic sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. An integrated approach in which one mode represents tissue property and the other its function will result in a systematic and comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancers.  n/a",Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis,6514660,R01CA087526,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' phantom model', ' progesterone', ' ultrasound blood flow measurement', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2002,200899,593605914,0.031565436043314354
"NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The hypothesis for the          proposed study is that women diagnosed with breast cancer have higher                mammographic density patterns in prediagnostic mammograms than women without a       diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, we postulate that despite differences       in mammographic density patterns among ethnic groups, the relation between           mammographic densities and breast cancer risk is similar in Japanese, Native         Hawaiian, and Caucasian women and that dietary factors contribute to the             variation in mammographic densities among ethnic groups. A large multiethnic         cohort in Hawaii established between 1993 and 1996 with well documented              differences in breast cancer risk offers a unique opportunity to research these      hypotheses. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the                 association between mammographic density patterns and breast cancer risk in          women of Japanese, Native Hawaiian, and Caucasian ancestry, to examine the           possible effect of dietary fat, fruit and vegetable intake, soy consumption,         and other dietary components on mammographic densities, and to elucidate the         relative importance of percent densities vs. the absolute size of the dense          areas in relation to breast cancer risk in women of different ethnicity.                                                                                                  We are proposing a nested case-control study using mammograms from women who         are part of the multiethnic cohort. We will include 3 ethnic groups who              represent the largest sub-groups: Caucasian, Japanese, and Native Hawaiian.          Mammograms performed before the diagnosis of breast cancer will be obtained for      women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1994 and 2000. For an equal number        of healthy controls, matched by age and ethnicity, we will identify mammograms       taken within 2 years of the time when the respective cases selected for              Inclusion in the study received their mammogram. Women with the following            characteristics will be excluded from the study: a diagnosis of breast cancer        before entry into the cohort, bilateral breast cancer, no previous mammogram,        and a previous history of breast augmentation, reduction surgery, or an              extensive surgical biopsy with a diagnosis of benign breast disease. Based on        breast cancer incidence in the cohort, mammography rates, and estimated              participation rates, we plan to enroll approximately 1,000 cases and 1,000           controls with 500 Japanese, 300, Caucasian, and 200 Native Hawaiian per group.       Potential study subjects will be contacted by mail and asked for permission to       retrieve a suitable mammogram from their mammography clinic. Women will also         complete a short questionnaire related to breast health. The statistical             analysis will include logistic regression to estimate the risk of developing         breast cancer in relation to mammographic density patterns and multiple linear       regression to examine the association between diet and density patterns.                                                                                                  n/a",NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY,6514385,R01CA085265,"['Hawaiian', ' Japanese American', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' caucasian American', ' clinical research', ' density', ' dietary lipid', ' female', ' fruit', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition related tag', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' soybeans', ' vegetables', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R01,2002,242820,45734163,0.1302847622989013
"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens.

"A GIS Based Workbench to Interpret Cancer Maps   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will develop and test a           methodology for identifying regions of excess cancer burden for breast and           colorectal cancer in Iowa. It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.

"EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MOLECULAR RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): We will expand our current      retrospective cohort study to determine the effect of molecular and histologic       factors that affect breast cancer risk in women with non-invasive breast             disease. The study cohort will consist of 12,387 women with non-invasive breast      disease diagnosed at our study hospitals between 1952 and 1992. Paraffin             embedded tissue from their initial breast biopsies is available on these             patients. Follow-up to determine breast cancer diagnosis and other                   epidemiologic risk factors will be obtained or extended through review of            hospital and tumor registry records and interviews with these patients or their      next-of-kin. We will conduct a series of nested case-control studies on these        women. Approximately 615 cohort members will develop invasive breast cancer          during 214,990 women-years of follow-up. These women will be our case patients.      Two controls will be selected for each case matched on entry histology, age at       biopsy and year of biopsy. Our major goals are to determine the influence of         various molecular factors on the breast cancer risk associated with different        types on benign breast disease. These include abnormal expression or regulation      of genes that affect the TGF beta and estrogen signal transduction pathways. We      will also study the genes that control estrogen metabolism. PCR and                  immunohistochemical methods will be used to study gene mutations and abnormal        protein expression, respectively. Conditional logistic regression analysis will      be used to assess the individual and combined effects of molecular, histologic       and epidemiologic variables on breast cancer risk.

It will permit the            combination of modern methods in molecular biology, pathology, and epidemiology      to assess potentially powerful new markers of breast cancer prognosis, and may       lead to important advances in the prevention and treatment of this disease.                                                                                               n/a",EPIDEMIOLOGY OF MOLECULAR RISK FACTORS FOR BREAST CANCER,6512653,R01CA050468,"['biopsy', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer registry /resource', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' estrogen receptors', ' female', ' genetic markers', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' interview', ' longitudinal human study', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' oncogenes', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' prognosis', ' transforming growth factors', "" women's health""]",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,569958,117374875,0.13166379160458833
"CIGARETTE SMOKING AND POST-PARTUM BREAST CANCER RISK Cigarette smoking has been hypothesized to have both carcinogenic and anti-estrogenic effects that may offset each other to produce no overall effect on breast cancer risk.  A full-term pregnancy also appears to have opposing effects on breast cancer risk: 1) an adverse effect shortly after delivery and 2) a beneficial effect over time.  If the transient increase risk of breast cancer is due to the growth-enhancing consequences of elevated pregnancy hormones on already initiated cells, then cigarette smoking during pregnancy, through its anti-estrogenic effect, can be expected to dampen this risk.  Conversely, with its carcinogenic effect, cigarette smoking during pregnancy might also reduce the long-term protection against breast cancer afforded by a full-term pregnancy.  We propose to examine the effects of cigarette smoking on the risk of postpartum breast cancer occurring at different intervals following delivery.  We will use a database that links together the Swedish Medical Birth Register, National Cancer Register, and Register of Causes of Death.  Members of the study population are all mothers who delivered a liveborn or stillborn baby after a gestation period of at least 28 weeks in Sweden between 1973 and 1998.  We have adopted a nested case-control sampling design to allow more efficient analyses.  Cases are approximately 3,500 women who had one or more childbirths between 1973 and 1998 and who had a breast cancer diagnosis during the same period.  For each case subject, five controls who were born in the same year as the index case, were alive at the date of the diagnosis for the index case, and had not been diagnosed with breast cancer by that date, will be randomly selected from the source population.  Logistic regression analysis will be applied to examine cigarette smoking as a risk determinant for postpartum breast cancer adjusting for age, parity, and age at first full-term pregnancy.  n/a",CIGARETTE SMOKING AND POST-PARTUM BREAST CANCER RISK,6225312,R01CA088891,"['Scandinavian country', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' estrogen inhibitor', ' female', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' postpartum', ' pregnancy', ' smoking', ' substance abuse epidemiology', ' tobacco', ' tobacco abuse', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2001,102372,294146927,0.11649715014536634
"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER INVASION DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided           diagnosi (CADx) system to predict breast lesion malignancy and invasion          based on medica findings.  Artificial neural network (ANN) techniques will       be used to predict whether mammographically suspect lesions are benign, in       situ cancer, or invasive cancer.                                                                                                                                  The ANN inputs will be derived from existing, available information such as      patient history and radiologists descriptions of lesion morphology              following the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).  ANNs      are well suited for this diagnostic task because, like humans, ANNs can be       taught to perform diagnostic tasks accurately and robustly when given            appropriate training examples.                                                                                                                                    The specific aims of the proposed study are to:  (1) Develop ANNs that use       mammography and history findings to predict malignancy and invasion of           breast lesions among a prospectively collected patient database; (2) Refine      the accuracy of the CADx system by optimizing the number of input findings       and investigating more complex network architectures, and study is               cost-effectiveness.  (3) Evaluate the CADx system clinically, by developing      a graphical user interface and using it to retrospectively evaluate the          systems performance.

The immediate benefit of this proposal is a noninvasive computer-aided           diagnosis system which provides information previously available only            through biopsy.  This system can assist mammographers and surgeons in            surgical planning for patients with breast lesions, and may reduce the cost      and morbidity of unnecessary surgical biopsies.                                   n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER INVASION,6376528,R29CA075547,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' computer human interaction', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' health care cost /financing', ' human data', ' mammography', ' neoplasm /cancer invasiveness', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' prognosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2001,104477,607172798,0.017403790779893194
"COMPUTERIZED MAMMOGRAPHIC LESION DESCRIPTION   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from Applicant's Abstract): Mammography is recognized as       an important means to reduce breast cancer mortality. However, its accuracy is       limited, both in sensitivity (some cancers are missed) and specificity (many         non-cancer cases are referred for invasive procedures). This proposal aims at        improving the effectiveness of breast cancer screening by the discovery of           measurements that can be taken from digital mammograms, and the design of            classifiers that result in an automatic computer-generated description of            suspicious areas. In particular, classifiers for the standardized lexicon for        mass shape, mass margin and mass density, as well as breast composition will be      designed.                                                                                                                                                                 These automaticaily generated descriptions are aimed at increasing the               specificity of mammography by providing the radiologist with a probability of        rnalignancy for the lesion. The descriptions should also be helpful in               conjunction with computer programs that detect suspicious areas, by rejecting        those detected areas that do not likely represent cancer (false positive             reduction). In addition, automatic description of a marnmographic iesion will        reduce reader variability and may heip in training radiologists to use the           standardized lexicon.                                                                                                                                                     This project will first develop a segmentation program, that finds the border        of a mammographic mass. The approach will be a multi-stage knowledge guided          system. Measurements to be taken from digital mammograms make use of this            border, and include some that have been reported in the literature as well as        newly proposed measurements. As the classification problem for mammographic          masses is very difficult, hybrid classifiers will be constructed that take           advantage of specific abilities of multiple classifiers. A rule based system         will be developed to arrive at an aggregate decision for each of the BIRADS          descriptions. Finally, these descriptions will be used in a classifier to            determine the likelihood of malignancy.                                                                                                                                   The outcome of this project would be the tools to develop an aid to non-expert       mammographers to define the characteristics of mammographic masses and help in       decisions to biopsy a mammographic lesion, but can also be applied to help           enhance sensitivity through computer assisted diagnosis, and in educational          tools.                                                                                                                                                                    n/a",COMPUTERIZED MAMMOGRAPHIC LESION DESCRIPTION,6260256,R21CA082639,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' human data', ' image processing', ' information display', ' mammography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R21,2001,145000,86023662,0.01813516968852954
"IMAGING NETWORK FOR BREAST CANCER MASS SCREENING   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose an internet-based dynamic           imaging system for detecting and monitoring changes in structural properties         of breast tissue that are indicative of breast cancer development.  The method       is based on the use of the proprietary Mechanical Imaging technology                 implemented in a small hand-held home-use self-palpation imaging device.  The        device is able to translate tissue's elastic properties into a digital map of        the breast, to objectively detect the presence of suspicious lesions and, if         necessary, to provide a woman with a warning signal ""see your doctor"".  Data         collected on a regular basis, e.g. once a week, will be sent via Internet to a       central database to form a four-dimensional (3-D plus time) image that will be       analyzed by a computer and a physician.  This project will lay a the                 foundation for a new approach to diagnostic medical imaging by adding the            temporal component to an image, by monitoring image changes over time using          data from an individual home-use device linked to a database.  The application       of machine-learning algorithms for developing a notion of ""individual norm""          for a particular woman using dynamic features of image and the image mining          will dramatically improve the sensitivity and diagnostic efficacy of the             imaging for a population wide screening.                                             PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION:  The hand-held home-use Mechanical Imaging self-palpation device connected via Internet  to a central database will serve as a mass-screening tool for the primary detection of   breast cancer.  The convenience, efficacy and affordability of this technology will provide  the foundation for the development of new markets for a product that should be a necessary  item for every woman over 30 year of age with the market potential in excess of 1 billion  dollar per year in the US alone.                                                                                                                                                                          n/a",IMAGING NETWORK FOR BREAST CANCER MASS SCREENING,6335728,R43CA091392,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' computer network', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' elasticity', ' mass screening', ' monitoring device', ' phantom model']",NCI,"ARTANN LABORATORIES, INC.",R43,2001,145999,0,0.029899082117148684
"Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis Our previous studies suggest that gray-scale ultrasound and Doppler imaging complement one another. While gray-scale imaging can characterize masses with high specificity, Doppler imaging has high sensitivity. This application proposes an innovative integration of the two modes such that both high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved. An intense 5-year multidisciplinary program encompassing three specific goals is proposed. In Aim 1 color-Doppler, power-Doppler and gray- scale images will be acquired from 300 patients with suspicious breast masses. All modes of imaging will be conducted on the same patients and on the same day. The issues related to optimal imaging will be emphasized by careful control of experimental conditions. Among other things, this will include regular image calibration and monitoring of progesterone levels in the patients to account for variations in blood flow during the normal menstrual cycle as well as for variations due to hormonal therapy. In Aim 2 we introduce new approaches for deriving quantitative features from Doppler and gray-scale images. The emphasis will be on quantifying features that physicians use in evaluating images. In Aim 3 these features will be supplemented with qualitative assessments to develop a multifactorial model for a comprehensive diagnosis of breast lesions. Novel approaches based on advanced nonlinear methods, including neural networks, will be developed to formulate a decision tree for cancer diagnosis. Each strategy will be evaluated by ROC analysis. This approach will provide objective measures to demonstrate the importance of sonographic and Doppler features and how they can be used optimally to accurately diagnose breast cancers. Taken together, this program takes advantage of unique breadth of clinical experience and basic sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. An integrated approach in which one mode represents tissue property and the other its function will result in a systematic and comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancers.  n/a",Doppler Vascularity/Sonography--Breast Cancer Diagnosis,6326270,R01CA087526,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' phantom model', ' progesterone', ' ultrasound blood flow measurement', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2001,200899,593605914,0.031565436043314354
"OPTICAL PROCESSOR BASED CAD FOR MAMMOGRAPHY Much progress has been made in the fight against breast cancer through early detection with screening mammography. Unfortunately, breast cancer can be missed on mammograms due to the difficulty of interpretation and inter-reader variability. For this reason, MedDetect has worked to build a hybrid optical and digital processor for the identification of potentially cancerous lesions on mammograms. The processor is comprised of an optical correlator (OC) combined with a neural network (NN). It is designed to mimic the radiologist - the OC being the eyes rapidly scanning for areas of interest, and the NN being the brain making a recommendation that the case is normal or has suspicious areas. MedDetect's proposed hybrid processor takes advantage of the best of both worlds--the best elements of optical processing and digital computing to create a complete Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. Supporting MedDetect in this effort are radiologists Drs. Brenner, Sadowsky, and Levy, University of South Florida algorithm experts and optics experts at Lockheed. If the proposed hypotheses are proven, this innovative technology will be ready for rapid transition into the clinical setting where it can assist radiologists in the early detection of breast cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed technology is responsive to a significant market. 25 million mammograms are performed each year and the number is growing. A similar volume of studies exists internationally. The ability to find breast cancer more consistently and perhaps earlier is of great interest to patients, radiologists, and payors. Thus, success with this research should lead to significant business opportunities.  n/a",OPTICAL PROCESSOR BASED CAD FOR MAMMOGRAPHY,6376925,R44CA079410,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' optics']",NCI,"MEDDETECT, INC.",R44,2001,226096,0,0.03674104514106883
"NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The hypothesis for the          proposed study is that women diagnosed with breast cancer have higher                mammographic density patterns in prediagnostic mammograms than women without a       diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, we postulate that despite differences       in mammographic density patterns among ethnic groups, the relation between           mammographic densities and breast cancer risk is similar in Japanese, Native         Hawaiian, and Caucasian women and that dietary factors contribute to the             variation in mammographic densities among ethnic groups. A large multiethnic         cohort in Hawaii established between 1993 and 1996 with well documented              differences in breast cancer risk offers a unique opportunity to research these      hypotheses. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the                 association between mammographic density patterns and breast cancer risk in          women of Japanese, Native Hawaiian, and Caucasian ancestry, to examine the           possible effect of dietary fat, fruit and vegetable intake, soy consumption,         and other dietary components on mammographic densities, and to elucidate the         relative importance of percent densities vs. the absolute size of the dense          areas in relation to breast cancer risk in women of different ethnicity.                                                                                                  We are proposing a nested case-control study using mammograms from women who         are part of the multiethnic cohort. We will include 3 ethnic groups who              represent the largest sub-groups: Caucasian, Japanese, and Native Hawaiian.          Mammograms performed before the diagnosis of breast cancer will be obtained for      women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1994 and 2000. For an equal number        of healthy controls, matched by age and ethnicity, we will identify mammograms       taken within 2 years of the time when the respective cases selected for              Inclusion in the study received their mammogram. Women with the following            characteristics will be excluded from the study: a diagnosis of breast cancer        before entry into the cohort, bilateral breast cancer, no previous mammogram,        and a previous history of breast augmentation, reduction surgery, or an              extensive surgical biopsy with a diagnosis of benign breast disease. Based on        breast cancer incidence in the cohort, mammography rates, and estimated              participation rates, we plan to enroll approximately 1,000 cases and 1,000           controls with 500 Japanese, 300, Caucasian, and 200 Native Hawaiian per group.       Potential study subjects will be contacted by mail and asked for permission to       retrieve a suitable mammogram from their mammography clinic. Women will also         complete a short questionnaire related to breast health. The statistical             analysis will include logistic regression to estimate the risk of developing         breast cancer in relation to mammographic density patterns and multiple linear       regression to examine the association between diet and density patterns.                                                                                                  n/a",NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY,6377598,R01CA085265,"['Hawaiian', ' Japanese American', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' caucasian American', ' clinical research', ' density', ' dietary lipid', ' female', ' fruit', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition related tag', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' soybeans', ' vegetables', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R01,2001,242820,45734163,0.1302847622989013

"INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY TESTICULAR CANCER The trend of increasing testicular cancer incidence is unlikely to be explained by known risk factors such as cryptorchidism. An infectious etiology of testicular cancer has been proposed, based on similarities between the age-specific incidence pattern of testicular cancer and that of other virus-associated malignancies. Only a small number of epidemiologic studies have evaluated this hypothesis, but collective results suggest that exposure to EBV and CMV may relate to testicular cancer risk. Further indirect evidence comes from studies showing increased risk among immunocompromised men, as well as from studies indicating a relation between testicular cancer and history of sexually transmitted diseases. Direct epidemiologic evidence regarding the role of sexually transmitted infectious agents in testicular cancer etiology is limited although suggestive. Using serum collected prospectively, we propose to evaluate the association between antibody response to HSV-2, HPV-16 and 15, HHV-8 and Chlamydia trachomatis on the one hand and the occurrence of testicular cancer on the other. As a secondary aim, we will examine whether the associations between infection with any of these agents and testicular cancer are modified by age. The proposed study is a case-control study nested in a well-defined cohort of men who donated blood samples as part of the JANUS project in Norway. The JANUS project, sponsored by the Norwegian Cancer Society, was established in 1973 for the purpose of prospectively collecting serum to be used in epidemiologic studies of cancer development and cardiovascular disease. As of October 1993, the JANUS serum bank contained 424,938 serum samples from 293,692 individuals, none of whom had cancer at the time of blood sampling. All blood donors to the JANUS serum bank are annually linked, through a unique, individual identification number, with the Cancer Registry of Norway. Eligible cases for the present analysis are male blood donors listed in the Cancer Registry through 1993 with a diagnosis of invasive testicular cancer. For each case, three blood donors, individually matched by age and year at sample collection, have been randomly selected from the JANUS serum bank as controls. A total of 88 case patients and 262 matched controls have been identified and will be included in the proposed analysis. Serum antibody titers against HSV-2, HPV, HHV-8 and C. trachomatis will be determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunofluorescence assays. Individual antibody titer values will be distributed into quartiles based on the distribution of the entire study population. The data will be modeled through conditional logistic regression, taking into account the individual matching. The JANUS cohort provides a unique opportunity to study infectious agents in relation to testicular cancer risk. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the viral origin of testicular cancer using serum collected prior to diagnosis.  n/a",INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY TESTICULAR CANCER,6173940,R03CA081590,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Scandinavian country', ' age difference', ' antibody titering', ' cancer registry /resource', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' herpes simplex virus 2', ' human data', ' human herpesvirus 8', ' human papillomavirus', ' human tissue', ' immunofluorescence technique', ' infection related neoplasm /cancer', ' male', ' mathematical model', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' serum', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' testis neoplasms']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R03,2000,69109,0,0.03470159021622739
"MAGNETIC FIELDS, MEDICATIONS, AND BREAST CANCER The primary purpose of this case-control study is to determine whether exposure to 60-Hz magnetic fields in a residential setting and/or light- at-night (LAN) increases the risk of breast cancer in women who have regularly taken selected types of prescription medications (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, psychotropics) in the ten years prior to diagnosis (or reference date for controls). The proposed study is prompted by specific findings in a study just completed by the research team (the melatonin study) that demonstrate effects of magnetic field exposure on nocturnal melatonin levels among women who are users of these classes of medication. A large case-control study of breast cancer in relation to residential magnetic fields and LAN, also just completed by the research team (parent study), did not evaluate the potential effects of such exposures on breast cancer risk among subgroups of women defined by the use of these medications. The present study is designed to obtain medication history data for women who participated in the parent case-control study so that more biologically directed analyses can be undertaken as suggested by the findings from the melatonin study. Women who participated in the parent study who are still alive and can be located will be invited to participate (anticipated to be approximately 1,471 women). Data collection will consist of a telephone interview designed to collect data on the use of the medications of interest (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and psychotropics). In an effort to disguise the primary purpose of the additional data collection, questions will also be asked about vitamin supplements and exercise habits, including the use of specific types of exercise equipment. Each subject will be sent an introductory letter describing the study and asking for her participation. Approximately three to five days after the letter has been mailed, a trained interviewer will call the subject and invite her to participate. If the subject agrees, a date and time for a telephone interview will be scheduled, and an advance packet of material will be scheduled, and an advance packet of material will be sent to the subject prior to the scheduled interview. The advanced packet will contain a letter describing the topic areas to be addressed in the interview, and materials to aid in the reconstruction and recall of medication use during the previous ten years. Conditional logistic regression analyses will be conducted to evaluate whether any relationship between the risk of breast cancer and exposure to magnetic fields or light-at-light varies among subjects with a history of using and not using any of the medications of interest.  n/a","MAGNETIC FIELDS, MEDICATIONS, AND BREAST CANCER",6174258,R03CA081614,"['beta antiadrenergic agent', ' breast neoplasms', ' calcium channel blockers', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' drug interactions', ' electromagnetic radiation', ' female', ' human subject', ' interview', ' lighting', ' magnetic field', ' psychotropic drugs', "" women's health""]",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CAN RES CTR,R03,2000,86500,0,0.08416109362174941
"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER INVASION DESCRIPTION:  The purpose of this study is to develop a computer-aided           diagnosi (CADx) system to predict breast lesion malignancy and invasion          based on medica findings.  Artificial neural network (ANN) techniques will       be used to predict whether mammographically suspect lesions are benign, in       situ cancer, or invasive cancer.                                                                                                                                  The ANN inputs will be derived from existing, available information such as      patient history and radiologists descriptions of lesion morphology              following the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).  ANNs      are well suited for this diagnostic task because, like humans, ANNs can be       taught to perform diagnostic tasks accurately and robustly when given            appropriate training examples.                                                                                                                                    The specific aims of the proposed study are to:  (1) Develop ANNs that use       mammography and history findings to predict malignancy and invasion of           breast lesions among a prospectively collected patient database; (2) Refine      the accuracy of the CADx system by optimizing the number of input findings       and investigating more complex network architectures, and study is               cost-effectiveness.  (3) Evaluate the CADx system clinically, by developing      a graphical user interface and using it to retrospectively evaluate the          systems performance.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED COMPUTER AIDED DETECTION SCHEME DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): Breast cancer is one            of the leading causes of death in women. Early detection, diagnosis and          treatment of breast cancer can significantly reduce breast cancer                morbidity and mortality. Accurate mammogram interpretation by                    radiologists is the key to the early detection of breast cancer. But,            it is still challenging for radiologists to maintain accurate and                efficient interpretation when given a massive volume of mammograms. With         the advances of digital radiography and computer technology, computer-           aided detection (CAD) schemes have been investigated with the hope to            provide a ""second opinion"" to radiologists so that their diagnostic              accuracy and efficiency can be significantly improved. In this project,          the applicants proposed to develop a knowledge-based CAD scheme, to              optimize the scheme, and to evaluate scheme's performance for the                identification of breast abnormalities on digitized mammograms. The              design of the scheme includes a learning process to establish a                  knowledge base and an identification process to identify breast                  abnormalities on digitized mammograms. The main idea is to investigate           a CAD scheme using knowledge based approaches so that the scheme is              largely independent from other rule-based approaches. The methods                include quantitative characterization of a suspicious region, and                ""similarity"" measures among the suspicious region and regions with               ""known"" truth (""positive"" or ""negative""). In addition, a classification          scheme will be investigated to classify the suspicious region as either          ""positive"" or ""negative"" using a ""likelihood"" measure. Efforts will be           undertaken to optimize and to evaluate the knowledge-based CAD scheme            in terms of sensitivity and specificity using patient cases that are             reviewed and verified by radiologists retrospectively. Receiver-                 operating characteristics (ROC) analysis will also be performed to               evaluate the scheme performance using a clinical database that was never         used during the scheme development and optimization.                              n/a",KNOWLEDGE BASED COMPUTER AIDED DETECTION SCHEME,6150405,R21CA082912,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasms', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' early diagnosis', ' female', ' human data', ' information systems', ' mammography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2000,150000,570146095,0.035961356766056704
"NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The hypothesis for the          proposed study is that women diagnosed with breast cancer have higher                mammographic density patterns in prediagnostic mammograms than women without a       diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, we postulate that despite differences       in mammographic density patterns among ethnic groups, the relation between           mammographic densities and breast cancer risk is similar in Japanese, Native         Hawaiian, and Caucasian women and that dietary factors contribute to the             variation in mammographic densities among ethnic groups. A large multiethnic         cohort in Hawaii established between 1993 and 1996 with well documented              differences in breast cancer risk offers a unique opportunity to research these      hypotheses. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the                 association between mammographic density patterns and breast cancer risk in          women of Japanese, Native Hawaiian, and Caucasian ancestry, to examine the           possible effect of dietary fat, fruit and vegetable intake, soy consumption,         and other dietary components on mammographic densities, and to elucidate the         relative importance of percent densities vs. the absolute size of the dense          areas in relation to breast cancer risk in women of different ethnicity.                                                                                                  We are proposing a nested case-control study using mammograms from women who         are part of the multiethnic cohort. We will include 3 ethnic groups who              represent the largest sub-groups: Caucasian, Japanese, and Native Hawaiian.          Mammograms performed before the diagnosis of breast cancer will be obtained for      women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1994 and 2000. For an equal number        of healthy controls, matched by age and ethnicity, we will identify mammograms       taken within 2 years of the time when the respective cases selected for              Inclusion in the study received their mammogram. Women with the following            characteristics will be excluded from the study: a diagnosis of breast cancer        before entry into the cohort, bilateral breast cancer, no previous mammogram,        and a previous history of breast augmentation, reduction surgery, or an              extensive surgical biopsy with a diagnosis of benign breast disease. Based on        breast cancer incidence in the cohort, mammography rates, and estimated              participation rates, we plan to enroll approximately 1,000 cases and 1,000           controls with 500 Japanese, 300, Caucasian, and 200 Native Hawaiian per group.       Potential study subjects will be contacted by mail and asked for permission to       retrieve a suitable mammogram from their mammography clinic. Women will also         complete a short questionnaire related to breast health. The statistical             analysis will include logistic regression to estimate the risk of developing         breast cancer in relation to mammographic density patterns and multiple linear       regression to examine the association between diet and density patterns.                                                                                                  n/a",NESTED CASE CONTROL STUDY OF MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY,6083941,R01CA085265,"['Hawaiian', ' Japanese American', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' cancer risk', ' caucasian American', ' clinical research', ' density', ' dietary lipid', ' female', ' fruit', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition related tag', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' soybeans', ' vegetables', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R01,2000,242820,45734163,0.1302847622989013
"OPTICAL PROCESSOR BASED CAD FOR MAMMOGRAPHY Much progress has been made in the fight against breast cancer through early detection with screening mammography. Unfortunately, breast cancer can be missed on mammograms due to the difficulty of interpretation and inter-reader variability. For this reason, MedDetect has worked to build a hybrid optical and digital processor for the identification of potentially cancerous lesions on mammograms. The processor is comprised of an optical correlator (OC) combined with a neural network (NN). It is designed to mimic the radiologist - the OC being the eyes rapidly scanning for areas of interest, and the NN being the brain making a recommendation that the case is normal or has suspicious areas. MedDetect's proposed hybrid processor takes advantage of the best of both worlds--the best elements of optical processing and digital computing to create a complete Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system. Supporting MedDetect in this effort are radiologists Drs. Brenner, Sadowsky, and Levy, University of South Florida algorithm experts and optics experts at Lockheed. If the proposed hypotheses are proven, this innovative technology will be ready for rapid transition into the clinical setting where it can assist radiologists in the early detection of breast cancer. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The proposed technology is responsive to a significant market. 25 million mammograms are performed each year and the number is growing. A similar volume of studies exists internationally. The ability to find breast cancer more consistently and perhaps earlier is of great interest to patients, radiologists, and payors. Thus, success with this research should lead to significant business opportunities.  n/a",OPTICAL PROCESSOR BASED CAD FOR MAMMOGRAPHY,6141339,R44CA079410,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer data analysis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' optics']",NCI,"MEDDETECT, INC.",R44,2000,519180,0,0.03674104514106883

"ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the US. For most patients, the disease is first diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the 5-year survival rate is low (< 30%). Despite incremental improvement in chemotherapy, the cure rate has not improved significantly in the past decades, The dramatic difference in long-term survival between patients with local disease (80-90%) and those with distant metastases (5-20%) suggests the need for a non-invasive, yet effective test applicable to at-risk population groups to detect ovarian cancer in early stages. Building upon prior research in differentiating malignant from benign ovarian masses, this project seeks to apply artificial neural network (ANN) technology to the problem of screening for early-stage ovarian cancer based on a variety of serum markers and other clinical inputs. The recently completed Phase I pilot project validated the feasibility by (1) assembling existing data from collaborating Organizations, (2) analyzing the predictive value of relevant biomarkers, (3) developing a preliminary ANN, and (4) validating the ANN using independent test data. The successful completion of Phase I now facilitates the commencement of Phase II activities to develop a production version of the screening system and to initiate broad-scale validation through multiple clinical studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ANN software capable of detecting early-stage ovarian cancer with sufficient improvement in specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value over alternative techniques would have clear commercial value in screening high-risk populations. Horns presently offers as a commercial product an Internet-based clinical information processing service, called ProstAsure, developed using ANN technology, for the detection of prostate cancer.  n/a",ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER,6211886,R44CA080459,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' ovary neoplasms']",NCI,"HORUS GLOBAL HEALTHNET, INC.",R44,2000,585610,0,-0.02222609082863093
"A SYSTEM FOR COMPUTER-AIDED MAMMOGRAM INTERPRETATION DESCRIPTION:  Screening mammography for early detection of breast cancer improves the chances of cure and allows for less traumatic and less expensive treatment.  Studies have shown that screening suffers from large variability in detection rates, and that radiologists do not identify all breast cancers that are visible on retrospective review.  The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to test and commercialize intelligent software for mammogram image analysis to assist radiologists in detecting early stage breast cancer.  The software prompts the radiologist to more carefully study computer-detected suspicious regions in the mammogram.  This has been shown to improve detection rates of breast cancer.  The specific aim in Phase II is to test the safety and effectiveness of the system in a clinical setting in order to allow for obtaining the regulatory, approval necessary before commercialization.
