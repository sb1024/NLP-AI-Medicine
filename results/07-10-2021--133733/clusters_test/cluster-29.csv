"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure.

"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333,338121506
"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level. Here, we propose to employ our new approach to identify novel environmental inducers of NDD.",Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders,10219009,R21ES032583,"['3-Dimensional', 'ASD patient', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Antidotes', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fetal Development', 'Flowcharts', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Differentiation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Protective Agents', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Services', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Vertebrates', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'bisphenol A', 'cell growth', 'cost effective', 'cytotoxicity', 'dashboard', 'environmental chemical', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'histone modification', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'male', 'man', 'microscopic imaging', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phthalates', 'prenatal exposure', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'self-renewal', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell model', 'stem cells', 'synaptogenesis', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R21,2021,195000,50305751
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421,148186688

"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779,136810522
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes. This study will provide new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. These findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals in the population, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.",Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes,10117729,R01ES031591,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Cytochrome P450', 'Data', 'Eicosanoids', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Intervention', 'Isoprostanes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipoxygenase', 'Live Birth', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Tyrosine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'economic cost', 'environmental agent', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'oxidation', 'phthalates', 'prevent', 'remediation', 'reproductive', 'software development', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical and machine learning', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,632023,641965656
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'dieting', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872,415711940
