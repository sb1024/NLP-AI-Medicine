"Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Vitamin D and Breast Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Applicant. This pre-doctoral fellowship (F31) application is designed to promote the training of Joyce Rhoden, a pre-doctoral student in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina. Her goal is to become an independent researcher who conducts innovative, translational health research. During the F31 training the applicant will be mentored by her sponsors Drs. Marilie Gammon and Cathrine Hoyo. Significance. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) result from incomplete combustion and are ubiquitous. Many, but not all, studies show positive associations between PAHs and breast cancer risk. Vitamin D significantly protects against oxidative stress in breast epithelial cells and is associated with lower breast cancer risk. Vitamin D prevents pre-neoplastic lesions in mammary gland explants after exposure to the PAH carcinogen 7,12- dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA). However, no epidemiologic study has examined if associations between PAHs and breast cancer incidence vary with plasma vitamin D or vitamin D polymorphisms. The study hypothesis is that elevated risks for breast cancer incidence associated with PAHs will be evident only in women with low vitamin D levels, or with genotypes that may lower vitamin D levels. Aim 1. Determine if PAH measures (PAH-DNA adducts and PAH sources (active and passive smoking, grilled/smoked foods, indoor fireplace use, vehicular traffic)) interact with plasma 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25-OHD) concentrations to influence breast cancer risk. Aim 2. Determine if PAH measures interact with any of 25 vitamin D-related genetic single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to influence breast cancer incidence. Aim 3. Determine if genetically predicted vitamin D levels influences breast cancer risk and assess whether the genetically predicted vitamin D levels modify the PAH-breast cancer associations. Approach. The dissertation will use existing information from 1508 women with breast cancer and 1556 women without breast cancer. Measures of PAH and vitamin D were assessed shortly after diagnosis. For Aims 1-3, logistic regression will be conducted to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to examine interaction on the multiplicative and additive scales. For Aim 3, an adjusted two-stage least squares regression method will be used to estimate a weighted genetic predictive score, which can then be used in logistic models. Innovation. This dissertation: (1) will be the first epidemiologic study to examine interaction between PAHs and vitamin D in association with breast cancer risk; (2) includes multi-level PAH and vitamin D measures; (3) explores biologically plausible SNPs; (4) will estimate genetically predicted vitamin D levels; and (5) uses a well-characterized population-based sample. Impact. The proposed dissertation may identify a potential low-cost risk reduction strategy for breast cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many, but not all population studies, have linked PAH sources to the development of breast cancer and inconsistently to survival following breast cancer diagnosis; reasons for the conflicting results are unclear. Vitamin D has been associated with decreased risk of developing breast cancer and may modulate the relationship between PAH exposure and breast cancer. Results from this dissertation may identify a low-cost intervention and improve understanding of the role of environmental exposures in breast cancer development.","Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Vitamin D and Breast Cancer",10065428,F31CA247251,"['Adverse effects', 'Aftercare', 'Apoptosis', 'Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'Carcinogens', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Damage', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Fellowship', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Tumorigenesis', 'Mammary gland', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'North Carolina', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Passive Smoking', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population Study', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoke', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Sun Exposure', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'ambient air pollution', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cigarette smoke', 'cost', 'delta opioid receptor', 'design', 'dimethylbenzanthracene', 'disorder risk', 'doctoral student', 'epidemiology study', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic predictors', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention cost', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'population based', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'protective effect']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,38062,511185245
"Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon Project Summary/Abstract: As cancer becomes an increasingly important cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, nations must improve their capacity to diagnose and treat the malignancies that most affect their populations. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality for women in Cameroon, where two thirds of patients present with stage III or IV disease, and five-year survival rates are less than 30%. A longstanding collaboration between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles (the MBLA partnership) plans to conduct key stakeholder interviews in order to assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a breast cancer screening program that is initially offered to high-risk women. Risk-based screening aims to equitably target early screening efforts while ensuring that diagnostic and treatment capacity are sufficient to manage lesions identified through screening. Such a program requires a breast cancer risk prediction model that is applicable and acceptable to Cameroonian women and feasible to evaluate through a community-based screening program. Studies in the United States, Asia, and Nigeria demonstrate that breast cancer risk prediction models perform best when they are ethnic group-specific, but no breast cancer risk prediction model has been developed for Cameroonian women. The African Breast Cancer case-control Study (ABCS) contains breast cancer risk factor information for women from Nigeria, Uganda, and a small subset of women from Cameroon. Traditional approaches to risk prediction will likely suffer from small sample size in models trained on Cameroon data only or from bias in models trained and validated on the full, ethnically diverse dataset. In Aim 1, a subgroup-specific cross-validation method will be incorporated into the Super Learner ensemble prediction algorithm to develop a breast cancer risk prediction model that incorporates all ABCS data but is optimized for Cameroonian women. Aim 2 addresses MBLA members’ concerns that certain risk factors from ABCS will be difficult to evaluate by community survey. Targeted learning methods will be used to define metrics for comparing risk prediction models including and excluding these variables so that Cameroonian stakeholders can evaluate whether to include these risk factors in their breast cancer risk prediction model. In Aim 3, an R shiny app will be developed, tested, and optimized in order to facilitate use of a Cameroon-specific breast cancer risk model in a future screening program. The methods developed and tested in this project could help to optimize cancer risk prediction models for other ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of the MBLA collaboration, UC Berkeley’s leaders in the field of targeted learning, and the UCSF Global Cancer Program. By providing protected time for training, research, and career development, this grant will facilitate the applicant’s progress towards becoming a breast surgical oncologist researching methods of improving access to cancer care in Africa. Project Narrative: In response to rising rates of breast cancer in Cameroon, a partnership between the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health, the University of Buea, and the University of California, Los Angeles plans to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a risk-based breast cancer screening program in Cameroon. This project aims to develop a method for defining a breast cancer risk prediction model optimized for Cameroonian women that makes use of information from a large, ethnically diverse case-control dataset and to provide Cameroonian stakeholders with information needed to select which risk factors to include in a Cameroon- specific breast cancer risk model. These methods could be used to define optimal cancer risk prediction models for ethnic groups with limited data in sub-Saharan Africa and globally.",Population-Targeted Risk Prediction to Guide Breast Cancer Screening in Cameroon,10141952,F32CA257350,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Asians', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cameroon', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Improve Access', 'Incidence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nigeria', 'Nigerian', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Study models', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Oncologist', 'Survival Rate', 'Target Populations', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Uganda', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'breast cancer registry', 'cancer care', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'design', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'mortality', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2021,74958,148186688
"Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors. This is due to shared risk factors between CVD and cancer, but also that breast cancer therapies are often cardiotoxic, which may later cause heart failure (HF). Cardiotoxicity from breast cancer chemotherapy affects between 10-20% of patients with enhanced risk in the presence of traditional CVD risk factors. However, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of cardiotoxicity among the rapidly growing population of young and emerging adult (YEA) breast cancer survivors, which comprise 5-12% of all breast cancer diagnoses. As survival from breast cancer increases, exposure to cardiotoxic chemotherapies at a younger age may enhance HF risk among YEA breast cancer survivors. Moreover, YEA breast cancer patients are more likely to have gene mutations that may also impair cardiac tissue function combined with a unique pattern of health behaviors and CVD risk factors. However, we are currently unable to predict which patients are at highest risk of cardiotoxicity. Studies suggest that gene expression may refine identification of women at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. To date, no studies examined whether combining gene expression and genetic mutations with CVD risk factors can identify YEA patients at increased risk of cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy. To address this issue, I will complete the following specific aims: 1) Develop a predictive model combining psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors to identify YEA breast cancer patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity as defined by a decline in global longitudinal strain (GLS) or left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); 2) Investigate if the risk factor profile at diagnosis is associated with trajectory of GLS and LVEF during and after breast cancer treatment; and 3) investigate the impact of molecular biomarkers to risk prediction models. We will recruit a longitudinal cohort of n=300 YEA breast cancer patients treated at Northwestern Medicine. Among these participants, in a nested case-control design, we will select cases diagnosed with decline in GLS during chemotherapy (n=50) with age-matched controls without cardiotoxicity (n=50). For all participants, we will combine electronic health record (EHR) data with psychosocial and traditional CVD risk factors at three timepoints. For the nested case-control study, we will additionally measure gene expression at two timepoints. This directly informs my short-term career development goals to 1) Gain experience in HF and CVD etiology, epidemiology, and risk factors; 2) Develop skills in machine learning and bioinformatics approaches for prediction; and 3) Refine health informatics methods to integrate EHR with epidemiologic and molecular data. The skills and pilot data generated through this K01 will enable me to address the NHLBI compelling question (5.CQ.10) to reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in cancer survivors. I will thus achieve my long-term career goal to identify and intervene on the CVD threats to the health and longevity of YEA cancer survivors. Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women globally, while cardiovascular disease has become a leading cause of death among breast cancer survivors. Commonly used breast cancer treatments are known to cause cardiotoxicity, but the majority of studies have not examined the growing population of young and emerging adult breast cancer patients. The objective of this study is to develop a personalized model of psychosocial factors, traditional CVD risk factors, and molecular markers that predicts risk of cardiotoxicity among YEA breast cancer patients.",Predicting risk of cardiotoxicity among young and emerging adult breast cancer patients from treatment to survivorship,10159953,K01HL152009,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cardiogenesis', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'chemotherapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical care', 'design', 'dieting', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular marker', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'social', 'survivorship', 'young adult', 'young cancer survivor']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2021,156336,367414121
"Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk SUMMARY Risk of developing contralateral breast cancer is a major concern among breast cancer survivors, especially for those who received radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer. The risk of developing radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) is further increased among those who were exposed to radiation at an early age. Several genotyping studies have shown that variation in the individual risk of developing RCBC is associated with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic variants. However, these studies have mainly analyzed a limited set of target/candidate SNPs that had been associated with general primary breast cancer in prior studies. This approach, building predictive models based on a small set of SNPs, has made marginal progress in distinguishing individual risk of RCBC. To the contrary, complex phenotypes or traits are likely the result of interactions of many biological sub-systems, most of which individually provide small effect size to predictive models, incrementally improving risk prediction. We have recently developed novel machine learning methods that use genome-wide SNPs to build patient-specific risk models of radiation-induced toxicity. These models use hundreds of SNPs in a nonlinear fashion and can be used to identify key biological correlates. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinical decision support tool that can be used to guide radiotherapy treatment decisions based on individual risk of RCBC. To improve patient-specific risk prediction of RCBC, we propose to apply these innovative methods to a rich dataset of the Women’s Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study. Under SA1: Genome-wide genotyping of the WECARE Study II, as part of this grant, we will complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotyping of 1626 samples from the WECARE Study II. Under SA2.1: Predictive modeling and biological analysis, we will apply our novel machine learning methods to the combined WECARE Study I and II to design a predictive model of RCBC risk in a young subpopulation treated with radiotherapy, using GWAS genotyping, clinical, and radiation data. We will also use bioinformatics methods to identify key biological correlates associated with RCBC risk. Under SA2.2: Comparison of biological correlates between subgroups, we will further investigate biological processes associated with radiation-unrelated contralateral breast cancer for the combined cohort in the WECARE Study I and II who did not receive radiotherapy. The resulting biological correlates will be compared with those found in SA2.1 for radiotherapy-treated women to better understand RCBC-specific biological mechanisms. Our model validation using an independent series of childhood cancer survivors who have developed radiation-associated breast cancer will enable us to examine the reliability and reproducibility of the model as a decision-making tool. If the RCBC risk model is validated, it will provide a clinical guide to identify high-risk patients who may need altered radiotherapy techniques (e.g., proton therapy), which offer reduced scatter dose. NARRATIVE Young women who receive radiotherapy are at increased risk for radiation-associated breast cancer. We have developed innovative modeling methods to build a predictive model of radiation-associated breast cancer risk based on patient genetic profiles using the unique, multi- center WECARE Study dataset for this study. If successful with rigorous validation on an independent dataset, this project will result in a clinical tool that could be used to inform breast cancer treatment decisions for young women at increased risk of radiation-associated breast cancer.",Radiotherapy-associated breast cancer: machine learning on genotypes to predict individualized risk,10104459,R21CA234752,"['Age', 'Age-Years', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer survivor', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chest', 'Childhood Cancer Survivor Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Contralateral Breast', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Late Effects', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Induced Cancer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Factor', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological systems', 'cancer genetics', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental radiation', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'proton therapy', 'radiation risk', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'whole genome', 'young woman']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R21,2021,167926,185946435
"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The risk for gastric cancer in the general population of the United States is low; however, certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups are at much higher risk.

"Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women For the >200,000 older women who develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer yearly, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) for at least five years increases overall survival. Yet almost half of patients prescribed AET fail to take all their pills. Education- and reminder-based studies in this and a number of other settings have had disappointingly small effects on adherence, and more complex interventions have proven difficult to sustain. In this proposal we seek a better understanding of the symptoms that women describe as major barriers to AET adherence. We draw on prior research suggesting that preexisting symptoms may play an important role in patients’ experience with AET. Our proposal fills crucial gaps in our understanding by examining older and less selected subjects treated in a usual care practice, and by using a measure that is already routinely collected across the United States. Specifically, we will use the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s Distress Thermometer (DT) and its accompanying problem list, which have previously been shown to reveal a high burden of symptoms among older women with breast cancer but have not been examined in association with AET or while accounting for the wide spectrum of comorbid conditions of older women. Most cancer centers administer the DT and problem list at diagnosis or earlier in care, increasing their value for informing early intervention to help women continue their AET. We will investigate whether the DT and problem list are predictive of AET discontinuation among older women, with specific aims as follows: Aim 1 To examine the association of patient-reported distress at diagnosis with early discontinuation of AET. We will utilize electronic health record data from a cohort of incident postmenopausal hormone receptor positive breast cancer patients to examine the association of the DT (scored 0 to 10) measured at diagnosis with AET discontinuation in time-to-event analyses, accounting for age, osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities, and other breast cancer treatments. Aim 2. To explore the association of patient-reported symptoms at diagnosis with discontinuation of AET. In the same cohort and using the same general approach, we will explore AET discontinuation and a) patient-reported overall symptom count based on DT problem list) and b) symptom clusters (e.g., fatigue, sleep, concentration). We will use both standard regression and an innovative application of machine learning using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With this approach, we will produce immediately actionable findings to improve adherence outcomes, by providing a means of identifying high-risk patients who are the primary targets for the development of new interventions. It could also be an important model for other conditions that are treated with aggressive treatment regimens in older patients, informing care for a large number of older patients. Over 200,000 older women develop hormone receptor positive breast cancer each year. We will examine whether the symptoms patients have even prior to treatments are related to completing five years of necessary estrogen-blocking breast cancer medications. This study will provide new information about whether preexisting symptoms and/or other factors are important barriers to patients, information that is essential to developing new ways to support patients in taking their medications.",Baseline Symptoms and Adherence to Oral Breast Cancer Therapy among Older Women,10261485,R21AG064875,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Age', 'Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Arthralgia', 'Attention', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast Cancer therapy', 'Cancer Center', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Estrogens', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Observational Study', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postmenopause', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Tamoxifen', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Thermometers', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Vasomotor', 'Woman', 'adjuvant endocrine therapy', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'older patient', 'older women', 'pill', 'poor sleep', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor']",NIA,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,195000,122662885
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization.

"3D Super-Resolution Ultrasound Imaging for Cancer Detection and Treatment Monitoring PROJECT SUMMARY Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for treatment of locally advanced breast cancer, which is a major clinical issue. Access to inexpensive and noninvasive methods to determine early treatment response are essential to determine if a chosen anticancer therapeutic regimen is efficacious. Tumor angiogenesis is a key biomarker of breast cancer growth and metastasis. This tumor microvascularity is known to exhibit distinct perfusion characteristics and morphologic features during the early stages of breast tumor development which fundamentally change during a positive response to neoadjuvant treatment. The overarching goal of this research project is to develop an innovative three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution (SR-US) imaging system and new image processing solutions to considerably improve our ability to perform in vivo quantitative analysis of tumor angiogenic networks. The first aim of this project involves optimization of 3D SR-US imaging functionality on a programmable US scanner equipped with a custom 1024-element (32 x 32) matrix array transducer. The second aim involves the development of new open-source SR-US image processing software for performing motion correction and quantitative analysis of tumor perfusion and microvascular morphology features in 3D space. In the third aim, we will evaluate the use of angiogenic biomarkers extracted from 3D SR- US images as a quantitative basis for distinguishing healthy from diseased tissue volumes in a transgenic animal model of breast cancer. We will also assess the use of in vivo 3D SR-US imaging for detection of early tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment using the same animal model.

"Deep interpretation of mammographic images in breast cancer screening Project Summary/Abstract Screening mammography has been shown effective in early detection of breast cancer and in reducing mortality. However, controversies and challenges still remain, with primary concerns on personal breast cancer risk prediction from mammographic parenchymal markers, high recall and benign biopsy rates, and improving radiologists’ clinical reading practices. Computerized methods have been developed in these regards, with the goal of providing computer assistance to radiologists in making clinical decisions. While successful, the accuracy of these methods is subject to appropriate data representation (i.e., image features) that requires strong feature engineering. A newly emerged artificial intelligence technique, called deep learning, represents a breakthrough in machine learning paradigms, and has revolutionized computer image analysis and many other applications in the past few years. Breast cancer screening yields a huge amount of mammogram data that requires in-depth interpretation to improve current clinical workup. The goal of this study is to develop and optimize a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computational approach to improve mammographic imaging trait identification, analysis, and interpretation and to use this approach to address accurate breast cancer risk prediction and reduce false recall rates. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the revolutionary deep learning technique on performing in-depth interpretation of big screening mammogram data, aimed at improving clinical practice. The new risk biomarkers will contribute to providing more accurate risk prediction than currently available. The recall-decision model will help reduce false recalls (associated with potential benign biopsy results), and better understand radiologists’ reading behaviors. Overall, the CNN-based approach will optimize the clinical utility of screening mammography and has a high likelihood to translate to the clinic for breast cancer screening. Public Health Relevance Statement (Project Narrative): We propose to apply a revolutionary deep learning approach to mine a big data of digital mammograms for improving mammogram data analysis and interpretation. This study will provide a computer-aided deep learning toolkit for improving breast cancer risk prediction and for aiding individual radiologists in their clinical decision-making on recalls. By introducing this newly emerged powerful machine learning technique to the clinical side of breast cancer screening, it will contribute to improving personal breast cancer risk prediction and reducing unnecessary recalls.

"Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms Project Summary The current breast cancer screening recommendations are essentially a one-size fits all approach and, therefore, not optimal in terms of effectiveness and resource utilization. This is because the typical approach focuses on finding subgroups of women who are at “higher than average risk” for developing breast cancer and aggressively promoting additional imaging techniques. However, most women (approximately 70%) who get breast cancer do not have any known risk factors. In addition, the majority of women (approximately 88%) never get breast cancer and these women benefit the least from breast cancer screening. To maximize the benefit to all women and minimize possible harms, investigators have advocated personalized screening using a woman's individual breast cancer risk. To do so, it is essential to have a marker that can provide an accurate near term mammography-detectable breast cancer (mBCa) risk to identify women with very high or very low near term mBCa risk. The goal of this application is to provide person-centered markers of mBCa risk, thus, offering a personalized screening strategy. We hypothesize that we can use temporal changes and lateral differences in images extracted by a novel imaging transformation from sequential mammograms to develop image-based risk markers that can provide women with an accurate near-term mBCa risk from their last negative mammography exam. We will build a database (N= 1,200, 400 cases and 800 controls) of sequential (≥ 5 years) full field digital mammograms collected from the medical records of women over 40 years of age for development and additional independent validation dataset (N = 600, 200 cases, 400 controls) for validation. We will develop year-specific risk markers using a novel Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (RCDT), convolutional neural network (CNN), and traditional non-imaging markers (such as age). RCDT effectively compares any two lateral and temporal mammograms and highlights differences between the two without having to explicitly align the two images. We will use CNN as a robust imaging marker to analyze the resulting RCDT images from mammograms. Using a statistical approach for handling longitudinal data based on risk sets, we will combine imaging-based risk markers and conventional non-imaging risk factors to develop two near-term risk markers, one for accurately predicting very high risk of having mBCa within a few years and another for predicting very low risk of having mBCa within a few years. High-risk and low-risk markers will be optimized separately to maximize the sizes of accurately predicted high and low risk groups. Project Narrative There is much controversy surrounding breast cancer screening guidelines, resulting in women making individual choices regarding their screening, in consultation with their physician. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information available to women as to the benefit of screening mammography for them as an individual. Our research goal is to develop a near-term mammography-detectable breast cancer risk marker using a new image transformation, deep learning, and statistical approach for longitudinal data on serial mammograms that will help women choose their own personalized protocol in consultation with their doctor.",Developing a personalized breast cancer screening tool using sequential mammograms,10174885,R37CA248207,"['Advocate', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radon', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Screening procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast density', 'cancer risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,357994,570146095
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906,377931988
"Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries One of the biggest cancer challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the lack of access to accurate and affordable cellular and molecular diagnostics, which are essential for making informed therapeutic decisions, in particular for breast cancer. With the increased use of low cost ultrasound, it has become possible to readily sample suspicious breast lesions with ﬁne needles (ﬁne needle aspirates, FNA). However, the workup of such specimens is often impossible in many LMIC settings. To address these barriers to diagnosis, Aikili—derived from A.I. and Akili (intelligence in Kiswahili)—seeks to enable the same-day diagnosis of breast cancer at the point-of-care using a low-cost, automated system. The Aikili system is a highly advanced stand-alone diagnostic platform capable of automated cancer diagnosis and receptor sub- typing in near real-time (< 1 hour), at a low cost (<$800 for integrated hardware and $5-10 per test). Building upon our initial development and successful clinical validation of human samples, the goal of this Phase I application is to advance the Aikili technology to signiﬁcantly improve its usability in resource-limited settings. Speciﬁcally, we propose to i) upgrade Aikili technology by incorporating a custom-designed disposable cartridge for onsite sample processing and deep learning algorithms for automatic analysis (Aim 1), and ii) evaluate the performance of the upgraded system in LMIC workﬂows through a validation study in Kenya (n = 30) (Aim 2). We will consider the Phase I project successful when we can show that the ﬁeld-optimized Aikili system accurately and reliably detects breast cancer and receptor status in human FNAs compared to accepted gold standards. Successful completion of Phase I would lead to a Phase II application for scale-up of manufacturing and a larger, multi-site clinical validation study. This platform may alter therapeutic paradigms for breast cancer patients in globally and enable appropriate use of chemotherapies and anti-estrogens in limited supply. We will develop a standalone, AI-powered diagnostic system to enable early cancer detection in low resource settings. Our system has the potential to transform cancer diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries where cytopathology is a major bottleneck; it will augment workflows by enabling non-expert healthcare workers to rapidly establish cancer diagnoses and identify molecular subtypes within 1 hour. This will inform the most appropriate therapeutic choices in collaboration with specialist physicians, as well as reduce patient loss to follow-up (LTF) by providing diagnosis in near real-time.",Rapid Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Low and Middle Income Countries,10154237,R43CA257694,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Cytopathology', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Estrogen Antagonists', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistics', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Needles', 'Palpable', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underserved Population', 'University Hospitals', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'molecular diagnostics', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'operation', 'point of care', 'prospective', 'receptor', 'usability', 'validation studies', 'years of life lost']",NCI,AIKILI BIOSYSTEMS INC.,R43,2021,400000,0
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,438819,367414121
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020,327644200
"Extraction of Symptom Burden from Clinical Narratives of Cancer Patients using Natural Language Processing Project Summary / Abstract Cancer patients frequently experience high levels of pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing, often related to the disease itself, its treatments, or both. This high symptom burden leads to significant impairment of cancer patients’ quality of life and may be associated with impaired survival. Optimal symptom management is required to minimize symptom burden and maximize quality of life for cancer patients throughout the course of their disease. Supportive care in cancer (SCC) teams are multidisciplinary teams that are focused on the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatments across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. These teams typically lack the resources to see all cancer patients and need to prioritize patients with the highest need, often relying on oncology physicians for referral. However, oncology physicians are often too focused on curing cancer than treating its symptoms. As a result, SCC services are often accessed by chance even when available, often later in the cancer trajectory. To improve recognition of SCC needs and to identify the symptom burden of cancer patients for better management and care, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches that can automatically extract symptom information from unstructured narratives. The proposed systems will utilize neural nets and build on the state of the art information extraction methods. To accomplish our goals, we will create a dataset of clinical notes for a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020. We focus on these two types of cancer as examples of two very different and prevalent cancer types. We propose to represent symptom burden documented in clinical narratives with a generalizable frame representation that captures fine-grained details including presence/absence, change-of- state, severity, characteristics, duration, frequency, and anatomy information related to patient symptoms. We will use active learning to create a diverse and representative gold standard annotated with symptom frames to train and test the proposed neural-based NLP approaches. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source resources. After successful completion of the project, the developed NLP methods will be integrated into the information access methods of SCCA and HCI clinical repositories. Project Narrative Cancer patients commonly experience pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing as well as impaired quality of life due to complications of the cancer itself, and/or cancer treatments. In this project, we will develop natural language processing (NLP) approaches to automatically extract detailed symptom information documented in clinical narratives of a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020.

"Convergent AI for Precise Breast Cancer Risk Assessment ABSTRACT  Breast cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the United States, despite the advances made in the identification of prognostic and predictive markers for breast cancer treatment. Mammographic reporting is the first step in the screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. Abnormal mammographic findings such as a mass, abnormal calcifications, architectural distortion, and asymmetric density can lead to a cancer diagnosis. The American College of Radiology developed the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to standardize mammographic reporting to facilitate biopsy decision-making. However, application of the BI-RADS lexicon has resulted in substantial inter-observer variability, including inappropriate term usage and missing data. This observer variability has lead in part to a considerable variation in the rate of biopsy across the US, with a majority of breast biopsies ultimately found to be benign lesions. Hence, there is the need for a system that can better stratify the risk of cancer and define a more optimum threshold for biopsy. To address this need, we propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques.  This study aims to develop a well-defined, novel risk assessment system incorporating multi-modality datasets with a novel predictive model that outputs a probability measure of cancer that is more clinically relevant and informative than the six discrete BI-RADS scores. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI- RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a predictive model that is more precise and clinically relevant may be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group. Our proposed technique entails a novel strategy using Natural Language Processing to extract pertinent clinical risk factors related to breast cancer from vast amounts of patient charts automatically and integrate them with corresponding image-omics data and radiologist- generated reports. We will extract and quantitate image features from both large amounts of mammography and breast ultrasound images and combine them with the radiology reports and pertinent clinical risk profile and other patient characteristics to generate a risk assessment score to aid radiologists and oncologists in breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decisions. Such a web-based application tool will be the first breast cancer risk assessment system based on integrative radiomics data augmented by AI methods. The iBRISK tool will enhance engagement between the patient and clinician for making an informed decision on whether or not to biopsy.  Our hypothesis is that BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics contain significant features for the breast cancer risk assessment and biopsy decision-making. By using BI-RADS reports and the imaging metrics, we will be able to develop new metrics to better breast cancer risk assessment. The novelty of the breast cancer risk assessment system is that it will incorporate a new predictive model that deploys deep learning and AI technology to provide a more reliable stratification of the BI-RADS subtypes for breast cancer risk assessment and reduce unnecessary breast biopsies and patients’ anxiety. Project Narrative  We propose to develop an intelligent-augmented risk assessment system for breast cancer management based on multimodality image and clinical information with deep learning and data mining techniques. Using mammographic or breast ultrasound BI-RADS reporting signatures and radiomics features, a more precise and clinically relevant predictive model will be developed to target well-characterized and defined specific biopsy patient subgroups rather than a broad heterogeneous biopsy group.

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10239049,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'unethical', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,517978,338121506
"Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations 1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available  2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a  3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause  4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small  5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called  6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before  7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the  8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which 9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and 10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown 11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in 12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are 13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer 14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed 15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin. 16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of 17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the 18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily 19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to 20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely 21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual 22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage 23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used 24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies 25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin 26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the 27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment 28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions. 29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers 30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology. UV-induced clonogenic mutations (CMs) can be used to evaluate an individual's overall sun exposure and the status of sun-induced genotoxicity in the skin which can profoundly impact how we diagnosis and treat early stage skin cancer. CMS can be used to evaluate therapeutic response to field treatments for skin cancer. CMS can be used to rapidly evaluate strategies for the prevention of skin cancer, such as the genoprotective efficacy of sunscreens or an individual's adherence to sunscreen application.",Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations,10097574,R01CA255242,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermis', 'Erythema', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Redness', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Squamous Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sun protection factor', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'UV carcinogenesis', 'UV induced', 'UV protection', 'UV sensitive', 'UVB induced', 'Ultraviolet B Radiation', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care outcomes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'genetic variant', 'genotoxicity', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mouse model', 'photoprotection', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive panel', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'skin cancer prevention', 'skin damage', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'standard of care', 'sun damage', 'sun protection', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,596193,38765145
"Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone ABSTRACT Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide, with 1.6 million new cases and 500,000 BC deaths annually. Patients diagnosed in low- resource settings (LRS) account for half of new cases, and the majority of deaths from BC worldwide. The first critical step to starting life-saving treatment for BC is the accurate and timely pathologic confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, a task which remains challenging in many LRS. Traditional pathology assessment involves processing surgically excised specimens with cell-block methods for: (1) cellular histopathology, which identifies abnormal cellular morphologies indicative of malignancy, and (2) molecular pathology, which identifies tumor biomarkers, specifically estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and the proliferation maker Ki67. Breast cancer subtyping using these markers is essential for determining prognosis, as well as for selecting subtype-specific therapies. Unfortunately, histology-based pathology services require a strong pathology infrastructure and trained pathologists, limiting access to these services in many LRS. For example, there are only 15 trained pathologists in Tanzania, a country of over 55 million people. There is hence an urgent need for new methods to accurately diagnose cancer, as well as to analyze expression levels of molecular biomarkers for tumor subtyping. A technology driven solution that could automate cellular pathology with minimal user-intervention and virtually no infrastructure requirements could thus enormously impact the management of breast cancer in LRS. Motivated by this need, the objective of this proposal is to finalize the development of the EpiView-D4 point-of-care test (POCT) to analyze both the cellular and molecular features of breast cancer from needle aspiration specimens. The EpiView component of the device enables easily accessible, low-cost, smart-phone based brightfield cellular imaging of fine needle aspirate breast biopsies without the need for pathologist assessment. In parallel, the D4 POCT component of the device images a point-of-care antibody microarray for the quantification of ER/PR/Her2/Ki67 levels from breast FNA lysate with picomolar sensitivity within 30 minutes at point-of-care, eliminating the need for additional visits before a treatment plan can be initiated. The EpiView-D4 will enable automated readout of both cytopathology and the molecular profiles of breast cancer, using machine learning algorithms integrated into a smartphone application. In this proposal, we will conduct final device development and training of ML algorithms, followed by pre-clinical validation and clinical investigation of the Epiview-D4 POCT, first at Duke University Medical Center, and then in the intended LRS of Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center. The impact of this technology lies in its potential to dramatically improve breast cancer management worldwide by enabling rapid and accurate diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancers, thereby driving timely and appropriate treatment for breast cancer patients and hence improving the outcomes for hundreds of thousands of women with BC annually in LRS. PROJECT NARRATIVE In less developed parts of the world, there is an urgent need for accurate and more informative diagnosis of breast cancer as trained pathologists are scarce‚ and pathology infrastructure is often very limited. The proposed research will complete the currently ongoing development of a cell-phone based device that: (1) images cells from breast tumors and analyzes them by software to identify whether a person has breast cancer, and (2) measures levels of clinically-relevant protein biomarkers to help guide treatment. If successful, this technology can be widely by health care workers to provide the same level of care in low-resource settings as is currently available in the US and will thereby save many lives.",Point-of-care cellular and molecular pathology of breast tumors on a cell phone,10115009,R01CA248491,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Breast biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Country', 'Cytology', 'Cytopathology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunodiagnostics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Needles', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Progesterone Receptors', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast cancer survival', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cellular imaging', 'cellular pathology', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'data repository', 'disorder subtype', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'protein biomarkers', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'subtype-specific therapies', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,607659,607172798
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083,524978793
"Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening SUMMARY Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer diagnosis to date. Women with a strong family history or related genetic mutations have an elevated risk of breast cancer and are recommended to participate in yearly MRI screenings. However, the rate of detection in this high-risk cohort is small, prompting a desire to reduce unnecessary MRI exams. The basic hypothesis of this project is that within the screening cohort the individual risk of a future cancer can be estimated based on the appearance of breast MRI and mammograms today. In preliminary work we have already identified low-risk women that could have omitted a screening session without missing a new cancer. The discovery of this lower-risk subgroup was made possible by modern deep-learning tools developed in preliminary work. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) has accrued a database of approximately 70,000 breast MRI exams over 18 years along with the patients’ clinical outcomes. This unprecedented resource enables the training of modern machine learning “from the ground-up” to extract and classify volumetric MRI features. The specific aims of this project are as follows. Aim 1 (Data curation): Systematic analysis of the large dataset accrued at MSK requires careful curation including image content, image quality, pathology results, clinical follow-up, as well as demographic and genomic information. The outcome of this Aim is a curated dataset that can broadly benefit future technical efforts in breast diagnosis. Aim 2 (Deep learning): To make risk stratification quantitative we propose to analyze the MRI scans using modern deep networks that have been trained to identify the location and extent of a cancer. We will then transfer the MRI features of these trained networks as well as networks trained on mammograms to the task of diagnosis and risk assessment. The intended outcome of this Aim are predictive models with human-level performance at diagnosis and segmentation. Aim 3 (Risk adjusted screening): To reduce the burden of screening while maintaining sensitivity we will estimate the risk of finding a malignant tumor in the future, based on the present MRI exam and most recent mammogram as well as patient information. The machine-estimated risk will be used in a retrospective analysis to determine the primary outcome, namely, the number of exams that could have been omitted by scheduling a longer screening interval without compromising sensitivity. This will be repeated on newly accrued data at MSK, Duke and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as secondary sites. Once validated, the risk-prediction model will be publicly released to encourage data sharing and clinical adoption. The preliminary work performed over the last two years has brought together a unique interdisciplinary team including clinical investigators on breast MRI at MSK, and machine-learning and medical imaging experts at CCNY, Duke and JHU. The platform technology that will be developed here is applicable beyond breast cancer, and the transfer learning approach applicable in particular to cancers with more limited datasets. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to detect breast cancer as early as possible while limiting the burden of screening in high-risk women. To this end, risk will be estimated from magnetic resonance images of the breast as well as mammograms using deep learning techniques. A retrospective analysis of a very large dataset will determine if some women could have avoided unnecessary scans without missing newly developing cancers.",Machine learning for risk-adjusted breast MRI screening,10121555,R01CA247910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancerous', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High Risk Woman', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reader', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast imaging', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data exchange', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'individualized prevention', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'quality assurance', 'radiologist', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2021,703284,10623740
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities. Relevance GenePattern is a popular bioinformatics software ecosystem that puts sophisticated computational methods within the reach of all biomedical researchers to address a variety of problems at the forefront of cancer research, including patient diagnosis and prognosis, identification of new drug targets, and understanding disease mechanisms. We will continue to support and enhance the system by providing interoperable access to additional software tools and data resources from GenePattern Notebook, a beginning-to-end computational electronic lab notebook environment for combining analysis and text. Moreover, we will expand our collection of notebooks that provide cancer investigators with scientist-oriented cancer analysis scenarios and tasks for use in their own studies.",GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research,10164740,U24CA248457,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinic', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'flexibility', 'genomic platform', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'online resource', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outreach', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'social media', 'symposium', 'tool', 'webinar']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,923435,524978793
