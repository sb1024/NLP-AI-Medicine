"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571,560644462
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,52157977
"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000,551214295
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865,230060143
"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10336135,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,100000,558628098
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10382633,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,148243,550947887
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333,338121506
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail. Successful completion of this project has the potential to identify new markers of disease and novel targets for treatment.",Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection,10152649,K08DK120953,"['Advisory Committees', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Arteritis', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Complex', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FYN gene', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'IGFBP3 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'TNFRSF17 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'base', 'belimumab', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'kidney biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'random forest', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,164258,533594881
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900,593605914
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500,14237512
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",10063870,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,178370,76545728
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955,816607
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875,685608202
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259,550947887
"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410,325573502
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796,673201228
"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000,9132113
"Investigating virus-host interactions with prime editing and genetic code expansion PROJECT SUMMARY Host proteins play essential roles in the replication of all viruses. This represents a vulnerability that could potentially be exploited to develop interventions against viruses currently circulating in humans as well as new and emerging viral threats. However, realizing this potential requires mechanistic understanding of how specific host factors function during viral infection. This proposal will develop a versatile screening methodology to investigate the mechanisms through which host proteins enhance virus replication. This will be achieved using recent developments in genome engineering and chemical biology that enable site-specific modification of host factors with unnatural amino acids. By genetically re-coding >100 host proteins implicated in the replication of influenza A virus (IAV), we will investigate (1) the effects of depleting specific host factors on virus replication and the subcellular localization of viral proteins; (2) the effects of viral infection on the expression and subcellular localization of host proteins; and (3) the effects of host factor depletion on the assembly and morphogenesis of new virus particles. If successful, this project will provide insight into the host dependency of IAV and establish a resource for investigating host protein function in the replication of additional, evolutionarily-divergent respiratory viruses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Therapeutic interventions that can prevent or control emerging viral infections are urgently needed.

"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580,1815440
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,R21AI151491,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691,558628098
"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Bladder', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Invaded', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannosides', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Uropathogenic E. coli', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'de novo mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleobase', 'pathogen', 'recurrent infection', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'time use', 'tool']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500,327644200
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213,533302350
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671,327644200
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000,0
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138,377931988
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844,641965656
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837,511185245
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587,533594881
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10236819,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,354795,28663340
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064,533302350
"Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with high- risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, HSCT is affected by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft- versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, both are mediated by donor T lymphocytes and significantly impact treatment success and thus overall outcome. AML patients commonly harbor FLT3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that is associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 targeted therapies have proven clinical benefit particularly when used in combinational approaches. Midostaurin (a kinase inhibitor) was recently approved for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition to their direct leukemia suppressive effects, FLT3 inhibitors activate leukemia antigen-specific T-cell responses. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that recognize antigens presented by MHC molecules. We recently characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or haplo-cord HSCT. We demonstrated that GvHD and relapse (exclusive of each other) are associated with lower TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our data suggest that individual variations in the immune repertoire significantly impact the clinical outcome in AML patients and underscore the need for comprehensive quantitative, functional, and mechanistic analyses of the TCR repertoire in a large cohort of AML patients. Here, we hypothesize: 1) TCR repertoire (diversity, clonal expansion, and V-segment utilization) affects clinical outcome (GvHD or relapse) and can therefore be used to identify GvL- and GvHD- associated clones; 2) Somatic mutations in leukemic cells (e.g., FLT3-ITD) affect the TCR repertoire and subsequent expansion of specific T-cell clones; and 3) FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin) modulate the TCR repertoire and function and enhance GvL effects in patients undergoing HSCT. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study characterizing the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape of leukemia cells in ~250 patients (~ 60–80 with FLT3-ITD). GvHD or relapse will be predicted using a proportional hazards model for competing risks based on TCR repertoire characteristics. TCR sequences and somatic mutations will be analyzed using a structure based prediction algorithms we developed to predict candidate leukemia neoantigens and associated TCR clones. Neoantigens will be validated using in vitro and murine models. Finally, functional analyses will examine the effect of midostaurin on TCR repertoire and function. Our findings will establish the TCR repertoire as a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes of HSCT and identify responsible TCR clones. The identification of TCR clones associated with the GvL effect against FLT3-ITD+ cells will facilitate the development of engineered T cells expressing GvL-associated TCR clones. Modifying the TCR repertoire composition via therapies targeting specific somatic mutations will facilitate development of optimized combinational therapeutic approaches, such as the addition of targeted therapy to post-transplant regimens. Narrative: Sparing normal cells while killing leukemic cells (harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia effect) by manipulating alloreactive T cells remains challenging in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative approach for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this proposed research, we leverage genomic and immunogenomic data obtained from patients undergoing HSCT to identify leukemia- specific neoantigens for preclinical investigation as potential therapeutic targets.

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613,641965656
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421,148186688
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464,533302350
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,449250,415711940
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10089406,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,483863,558628098
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions.

"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and prediction of disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxias.",A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change,10210639,R01NS117826,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Disorders', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Vision', 'arm', 'arm function', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'illness length', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microphone', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oculomotor', 'open source', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555308,551214295
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,10071093,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2021,623092,65064605
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779,136810522
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales. Our experiments and modeling will help to understand the mechanisms of embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong correlation between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular disease? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering.",Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi,10165811,R01HL148227,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopolymers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytolysis', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Elements', 'Enzymes', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evolution', 'Fiber', 'Fibrin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fracture', 'Frustration', 'Gel', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hydrogels', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rupture', 'Specimen', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thermodynamics', 'Thick', 'Thrombin', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Traction', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'fiber cell', 'fluid flow', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'materials science', 'mechanical properties', 'models and simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular scale', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nanoscale', 'neutrophil', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'synergism', 'theories', 'thrombotic', 'tool', 'venous thromboembolism', 'viscoelasticity']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,639595,593605914
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893,415711940
"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. Understanding what stimulates these behaviors will help research scientists and physicians to make bone marrow transplants more successful at curing cancer.",Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes,10101252,R01HL155741,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Antitumor Response', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Donor Selection', 'Education', 'Failure', 'Gene Combinations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologist', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'NK cell receptor NKB1', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptide Leader Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Receptor Gene', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'dimorphism', 'disorder risk', 'graft vs host disease', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'peptide B', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relapse prediction', 'response']",NHLBI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,650223,185946435
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385,254622553
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,10159730,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,689648,758431960
"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,10092079,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,728879,524978793
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026,292134808
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,10129277,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,798304,111231681
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19,10273964,R61HD105618,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'BLase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 assay', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'California', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'FDA Emergency Use Authorization', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'RADx', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'cell free DNA', 'clinical assay development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'genetic pedigree', 'nasal swab', 'novel strategies', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2021,863810,685608202
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,10087953,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,912947,148463823
"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463,254622553
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775,641965656
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830,593605914
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730,560644462
"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'dieting', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872,415711940
"Web-based Automated Imaging Differentiation of Parkinsonism SUMMARY Across the globe, there has been a considerable growth in the number of people diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Estimates indicate that from 1990 to 2015 the number of Parkinsonism diagnoses doubled, with more than 6 million people currently carrying the diagnosis, and by year 2040, 12 and 14.2 million people will be diagnosed with Parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy Parkinsonian variant (MSAp), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are neurodegenerative forms of Parkinsonism, which can be difficult to diagnose as they share similar motor and non-motor features, and they each have an increased chance of developing dementia. In the first five years of a PD diagnosis, about 58% of PD are misdiagnosed, and of these misdiagnoses about half have either MSA or PSP. Since PD, MSAp, and PSP require unique treatment plans and different medications, and clinical trials testing new medications require the correct diagnosis, there is an urgent need for both clinic ready and clinical-trial ready markers for differential diagnosis of PD, MSAp, and PSP. Over the past decade, we have developed diffusion imaging as an innovative biomarker for differentiating PD, MSAp, and PSP. In this proposal, we will leverage our extensive experience to create a web-based software tool that can process diffusion imaging data from anywhere in the world. We will disseminate and test the tool in the largest prospective cohort of participants with Parkinsonism (PD, MSAp, PSP), working closely with the Parkinson Study Group. The reason to test this in the Parkinson Study Group network, is because they are the community that evaluates Phase II and Phase III clinical trials in Parkinsonism. This web-based software tool will be capable of reading raw diffusion imaging data, performing quality assurance procedures, analyzing the data using a validated pipeline, and providing imaging metrics and diagnostic probability. We will test the performance of the wAID-P by enrolling 315 total subjects (105 PD, 105 MSAp, 105 PSP) across 21 sites in the Parkinson Study Group. Each site will perform imaging, clinical scales, diagnosis, and will upload the data to the web-based software tool. The clinical diagnosis will be blinded to the diagnostic algorithm and the imaging diagnosis will be compared to the movement disorders trained neurologist diagnosis. We will also enroll a portion of the cohort into a brain bank to ascertain pathological confirmation and to test the algorithm against cases with post-mortem diagnoses. The final outcome will be to disseminate a validated diagnostic algorithm to the Parkinson neurological and radiological community and to make it available to all on a website. NARRATIVE In this proposal, we will be developing, disseminating, and evaluating a web-based software tool that can perform MRI analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinsonism. Our goal is to leverage our years of experience and algorithm development, to test a prospective cohort of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple System Atrophy, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10080700,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,2648626,415711940
