"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",10116983,U01CA239055,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Oncology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'cohort', 'combat', 'companion diagnostics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1,197030888
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%. Eysz's proposed seizure detection solution will provide unobtrusive, objective, automated detection of seizure activity in an outpatient setting in near real time, improving medical decision- making, decreasing time to treatment, reducing mortality, and ultimately improving quality of life for those with epilepsy.",Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data,10372655,R43NS119015,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Blinking', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Glass', 'Gold', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Shark', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tonic - clonic seizures', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'commercialization', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'premature', 'prospective', 'software systems', 'statistical and machine learning', 'visual tracking', 'wearable device']",NINDS,"EYSZ, INC.",R43,2021,52000,511154
"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers. The findings will facilitate the optimal usage of existing drugs and the development of novel therapies for pediatric cancer, and will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career as an expert in this area.",Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells,10112859,K99CA248944,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Screening for cancer', 'Seasons', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translations', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'chemical genetics', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'experimental study', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,K99,2021,105802,82645678
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer Project Summary. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)- driven, medical imaging platform that utilizes computed tomography (CT) imaging to identify the presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC is a debilitating disease with significant patient-related morbidity related to the disease itself and its management, which is complex and consists of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. A key factor in determining proper HNSCC management is the presence of ENE, which occurs when tumor infiltrates through the capsule of an involved lymph node into the surrounding tissue. ENE is both an important prognostic factor and an indication for adjuvant treatment escalation with the addition of chemotherapy to radiation following surgery. This “trimodality therapy” is problematic, as it is associated with increased treatment-related morbidity and healthcare costs, but no improvement in disease control compared to upfront chemoradiation alone. The challenge is that ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE identification has proven unreliable for even expert diagnosticians, leading to high rates of trimodality therapy and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In HNSCC management there is a critical need for improved pretreatment ENE identification to 1) select appropriate patients for surgery to avoid the excess morbidity and costs of trimodality therapy, 2) risk-stratify patients optimally, and 3) select appropriate patients for treatment de-escalation or intensification clinical trials. In recent years, Deep learning, a subtype of machine learning, under the umbrella of AI, has generated breakthroughs in computerized medical image analysis, at times outperforming human experts and discovering patterns hidden to the naked eye. While AI is poised to transform the fields of cancer imaging and personalized cancer care, there remain significant barriers to clinical implementation. The hypothesis of this project is that AI can be used to successfully identify HNSCC ENE on pretreatment imaging in retrospective and prospective patient cohorts and to develop a platform for lymph node auto-segmentation that will promote clinical utility of the platform. This hypothesis will be tested by rigorous optimization and evaluation of a deep learning ENE identification platform. Specifically, the platform will be validated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory performance on two heterogeneous retrospective datasets and two prospective cohorts derived from institutional and national Phase II clinical trials for HNSCC patients. The platform will then be directly compared with head and neck radiologists to determine if radiologist performance can be augmented with AI. In parallel, AI will be utilized to develop an auto-segmentation platform for tumor and lymph nodes, which will 1) improve the platform's clinical impact and 2) provide a valuable tool for treatment planning and future imaging-based research for HNSCC patients. 1 Project Narrative Identification of extranodal extension (ENE) for head and neck cancer in the pretreatment setting would be extremely useful in selecting the optimal treatment strategy for patients. Currently, ENE can only be definitively diagnosed pathologically after surgery, and pretreatment radiographic ENE prediction has proven unreliable for expert diagnosticians. This project uses artificial intelligence to identify ENE pretreatment on Computed Tomography, with the goal of developing a clinically usable tool to help patients with newly diagnosed head and neck cancers and their physicians choose the most effective treatment strategy that minimizes the risk of side effects.","Development of an artificial intelligence-driven, imaging-based platform for pretreatment identification of extranodal extension in head and neck cancer",10105483,K08DE030216,"['Adjuvant', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Extranodal', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck Dissection', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'capsule', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'heuristics', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'personalized cancer care', 'phase II trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIDCR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,168240,327644200
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,10086856,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,309176,340417756
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,10114224,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,414490,551214295
"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,9929565,U01CA220401,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer survival', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'interactive tool', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplasm resource', 'non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma patients', 'open source', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,437968,367414121
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,438819,367414121
"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,10145619,R01CA241666,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fingerprint', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune system', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nanostructures', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Silanes', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Width', 'Woman', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'cancer type', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'early screening', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'multiplex detection', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'nanoscale', 'nanosized', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vesicle transport', 'vesicular release']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,533280,254622553
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging. Our proposal is based on a collaborative integrated team of university scientists, clinician-scientists and industry engineers to develop and clinically trial new MRI technology that overcomes limitations related to imaging small liver tumors in patients.",Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases,10063981,R01CA245920,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Benign', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Chelating Agents', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resectable', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'colon cancer patients', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'liver imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,536670,161094826
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260,641965656
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266,168440418
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083,524978793
"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.  The requested funds will be used to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the device in a larger clinical study needed to enable regulatory approval of the device.",Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing,10127607,R44CA250768,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Assessment tool', 'Basal Cell', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Detection', 'Device Approval', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Family Practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hand functions', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malpractice', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasms', 'Nevus', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Optics', 'Painless', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Physicians', 'Pigments', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening for Skin Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Vascular resistance', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical pressure', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'peace', 'pressure', 'response', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'skin lesion', 'tumor', 'vascular abnormality']",NCI,"VERISKIN, INC.",R44,2021,833460,1164975
