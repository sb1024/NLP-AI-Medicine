"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,10117077,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,83750,550947887
"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Drowning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactivity', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'longitudinal positron emission tomography', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'recruit', 'research study', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'simulation', 'study population', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,100863,560644462
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10224190,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2021,119250,276703803
"Super-Resolution Tau PET Imaging for Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (the presymptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease) is characterized by pathophysiological changes without measurable cognitive decline and begins decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Preclinical Alzheimer’s disease research is in pressing need of new biomarker endpoints to enable disease monitoring before traditional cognitive endpoints are measurable. The overarching research objectives of this R03 Small Project Grant are to develop a super-resolution (SR) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging framework for tau (a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease) and to assess the clinical utility of localized outcome measures obtained from SR PET images. Studies show that tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe is an important marker of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. Cohorts focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s now incorporate serialized 18F-flortaucipir PET scans for longitudinal tracking of tau accumulation in key anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). The quantitative accuracy of tau PET, however, is degraded by the limited spatial resolution capabilities of PET, which lead to inter-ROI spillover and partial volume effects. The problem is further compounded in studies spanning several decades, many of which were commenced on legacy scanners with even lower resolution capabilities than the current state of the art. Additionally, many longitudinal studies began on older scanners and later transitioned to newer models posing a multi-scanner data harmonization challenge. The proposed SR framework will perform a mapping from a low- resolution scanner’s image domain to a high-resolution scanner’s image domain and enable PET resolution recovery and data harmonization. Underlying the proposed framework is a neural network model that can be adversarially trained in self-supervised mode without requiring paired input/output image samples for training. This critical feature ensures practical clinical utility of the method as the need for paired low-resolution and high- resolution datasets from the same subject with similar tracer dose and scan settings is a major barrier for the clinical translatability of simpler supervised alternatives for SR. The proposed network, although trained using unpaired clinical data, receives guidance from an ancillary neural network separately pretrained using paired simulation datasets. For this purpose, we will synthesize paired low- and high-resolution images from a series of digital tau phantoms that will be created for this project. Training and validation of the self-supervised SR framework will be performed via secondary use of de-identified 18F-flortaucipir PET scans from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a longitudinal cohort focused on preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. We will evaluate SR performance using a variety of image quality metrics. To assess the clinical utility of localized super-resolution measures, we will perform cross-sectional statistical power analyses that estimate sample sizes per arm needed to power clinical trials. Accurate localized measures of tau generated by this project could enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and facilitate ongoing clinical trials by reducing sample sizes required for a given effect size. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this R03 Small Project Grant is to develop methods for generating high-resolution images of abnormal tau protein tangles, which are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. This will be achieved by building a self-supervised super-resolution framework based on a deep neural network for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tau.

"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions.

"Artificial Intelligence for Assessment of Stargardt Macular Atrophy Project Abstract Stargardt disease is the most frequent form of inherited juvenile macular degeneration. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a widely available imaging technique which may aid in the diagnosis of Stargardt disease and is commonly used to monitor its progression. FAF imaging provides an in vivo assay of the retinal layers, but is only an indirect measure. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), in contrast, provides three-dimensional visualization of the retinal microstructure, thereby allowing it to be assessed directly and individually in eyes with Stargardt disease. At a retinal disease endpoints meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November of 2016, a reliable measure of the anatomic status of the integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) in the retina, was proposed to be a potential suitable regulatory endpoint for therapeutic intervention clinical trials. Manual segmentation/identification of the EZ band, particularly in 3-D OCT images, has proven to be extremely tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. Automated objective segmentation techniques, such as an approach using a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct, would be of significant value. Moreover, Stargardt disease may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials. Thus, this proposal develops an AI-based approach for automated Stargardt atrophy segmentation and the prediction of atrophy progression in FAF and OCT images. More specifically, we first register the longitudinal FAF and OCT enface images respectively, and register the cross-sectional FAF to OCT image. We then develop a 2-D approach for Stargardt atrophy segmentation from FAF images using an AI approach and a 3-D approach for EZ band segmentation from OCT images using a 3-D graph-based approach. Finally, an AI-based approach is developed to predict subsequent development of new Stargardt atrophy or progression of existing atrophy from the OCT EZ band thickness and intensity features of the current patient visit. Project Narrative Stargardt disease is an inherited juvenile-onset macular dystrophy that may cause severe visual loss in children and young adults, thereby causing enormous morbidity with economic, psychological, emotional, and social implications. Early prediction of Stargardt disease progression may facilitate new therapeutic trials.

"Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports ABSTRACT Automated biomedical image classification has seen enormous improvements in performance over recent years, particularly in radiology. However, the machine learning (ML) methods that have achieved this remarkable performance often require enormous amounts of labeled data for training. An increasingly accepted means of acquiring this data is through the use of natural language processing (NLP) on the free-text reports associated with an image For example, take the following brain MRI report snippet:  There is evidence of left parietal encephalomalacia consistent with known history of prior stroke. Small  focal area of hemosiderin deposition along the lateral margins of the left lateral ventricle. Here, the associated MRI could be labeled for both Encephalomalacia and Hemosiderin. NLP methods to automatically label images in this way have been used to create several large image classification datasets However, as this example demonstrates, radiology reports often contain far more granular information than prior NLP methods attempted to extract. Both findings in the above example mention their anatomical location, which linguistically is referred to as a spatial grounding, as the location anchors the finding in a spatial reference. Further, the encephalomalacia finding is connected to the related diagnosis of stroke, while the hemosiderin finding provides a morphological description (small focal area). This granular information is important for image classification, as advanced deep learning methods are capable of utilizing highly granular structured data. This is logical, as for instance a lung tumor has a slightly different presentation than a liver tumor. If an ML algorithm can leverage both the coarse information (the general presentation of a tumor) while also recognizing the subtle granular differences, it can find an optimal balance between specificity and generalizability. From an imaging perspective, this can also be seen as a middle ground between image-level labels (which are cheap but require significant data for training—a typical dataset has thousands of images or more) and segmentation (which is expensive to obtain, but provides better training data—a typical dataset has 40 to 200 images), as the fine-grained spatial labels correspond to natural anatomical segments. Our fundamental hypothesis in this project is that if granular information can be extracted from radiology reports with NLP, this will improve downstream radiological image classification when training on a sufficiently large dataset. For radiology, the primary form of granularity is spatial (location, shape, orientation, etc.), so this will be the focus of our efforts. We further hypothesize that these NLP techniques will be generalizable to most types of radiology reports. For the purpose of this R21-scale project, however, we will focus on three distinct types of reports with different challenges: chest X-rays (one of the most-studied and largest-scale image classification types), extremity X-rays (which offer different findings than chest X-rays), and brain MRIs (which present a different image modality and the additional complexity of three dimensions). NARRATIVE This project is interested in developing natural language processing (NLP) methods for better understanding the spatial relationships described in the free text data within radiology reports found in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We will (i) develop an ontology, (ii) manually create a dataset for training NLP methods, (iii) develop automatic NLP methods compatible the ontology and corpus, and (iv) evaluate automatic image classification methods that use the output of the NLP system as image labels.",Fine-grained spatial information extraction for radiology reports,10116379,R21EB029575,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Encephalomalacia', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hemosiderin', 'Human', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Limb structure', 'Linguistics', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Training', 'Trust', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lateral ventricle', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'spatial relationship', 'structured data', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,195000,135644722
"Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD have identified many disease-susceptibility genes. Through great efforts from international GWAS consortium and large-scale collaborative projects, massive datasets including high-quality GWAS data and well-characterized clinical phenotypes are now available in public repositories such as dbGaP and UK Biobank. Clinically, color fundus images have been extensively used by ophthalmologists to diagnose AMD and its severity level. The combination of wealthy GWAS data and fundus image data provides an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to test new hypotheses that are beyond the objectives of original projects. Among them, predictive models for AMD development and its progression based on both GWAS and fundus image data have not been explored. Most existing prediction models only focus on classic statistical approaches, often regression models with a limited number of predictors (e.g., SNPs). Moreover, most predictions only give static risks rather than dynamic risk trajectories over time, of which the latter is more informative for a progressive disease like AMD. Recent advances of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, have been proven to significantly improve prediction accuracy by incorporating multiple layers of hidden non-linear effects when large-scale training datasets with well-defined phenotypes are available. Despite its success in many areas, deep learning has not been fully explored in AMD and other eye diseases. Motivated by multiple large-scale studies of AMD development or progression, where GWAS and/or longitudinal fundus image data have been collected, we propose novel deep learning methods for predicting AMD status and its progression, and to identify subgroups with significant different risk profiles. Specially, in Aim 1, we will construct a novel local convolutional neural network to predict disease occurrence (AMD or not) and severity (e.g., mild AMD, intermediate AMD, late AMD) based on (1a): a large cohort of 35,000+ individuals with GWAS data and (1b): a smaller cohort of 4,000+ individuals with both GWAS and fundus image data. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel deep neural network survival model for predicting individual disease progression trajectory (e.g., time to late-AMD). In both aims, we will use the local linear approximation technique to identify important predictors that contribute to individual risk profile prediction and to identify subgroups with different risk profiles. In Aim 3, we will validate and calibrate our methods using independent cohorts and implement proposed methods into user-friendly software and easy-to-access web interface. With the very recent FDA approval for Beovu, a novel injection treatment for wet AMD (one type of late AMD) by inhibiting VEGF and thus suppressing the growth of abnormal blood vessels, it makes our study more significant, as it will provide most cutting-edge and comprehensive prediction models for AMD which have great potential to facilitate early diagnosis and tailored treatment and clinical management of the disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new analytic methods and software tools to facilitate novel prediction of AMD development and its progression. The successful completion of the project will generate the first comprehensive set of deep-learning-based prediction models and web-based interfaces, which jointly analyzes large-scale GWAS and fundus image data and has the great potential to enhance the early diagnosis and current clinical management of AMD. The analytic approach can be applied to other eye diseases where large-scale genetics and/or image data are collected.",Deep-learning-based prediction of AMD and its progression with GWAS and fundus image data,10226322,R21EY030488,"['Achievement', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Exposure to', 'Eye diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'data repository', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'fundus imaging', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'public repository', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'synergism', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web based interface', 'web interface']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,220287,570146095
"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There has been significant work in creating tools that leverage computer vision algorithms to automate medical image analysis. Most of these algorithms have been developed for natural images, which are usually single static images that can be treated individually. However, medical images are usually part of a study that may include various views and orientations that are considered together with other clinical data when making a diagnosis. Three dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN) can address this issue in part when images are evenly spaced, but many medical imaging modalities such as ultrasound (US), fluoroscopy, and biopsy imaging have variable orientations and irregular spacing. Graph convolutional networks (GCN) have the potential to address this issue as they generalize the assumptions of CNNs to work on arbitrarily structured graphs. Automatic thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound (US) is one application that such a graph-based approach could have a large impact. The thyroid cancer incidence rate has tripled in the past thirty years, with an estimated cost of $18-21 billon in 2019. US is the imaging modality of choice, which consists of multiple 2D images of different locations and orientations. US readings are often vague and subjective in nature, which has resulted in a steady increase in the number of biopsies performed over the past 20 years. It is estimated that about one-third of all thyroid biopsy procedures performed in the United States are medically unnecessary, leading to the unmet need for noninvasive diagnostic tests that can reliably identify which nodules require a biopsy. The research objective of this R21 is to develop a new graph-based approach to leverage spatial information contained within imaging studies that will be combined with biomarkers and other known risk factors. Our graph model will enable more complete detection of thyroid cancer, as well as the prediction of future cancer aggression, both with spatially localized explanations. GCN features will be used to predict voxel-level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical image analysis plays an important role in computer aided detection and diagnosis, but usually focuses on individual images in isolation. Graph convolutional networks have the ability to utilize the relationships be- tween images in a study to aggregate information and make a more accurate evaluation. The focus of this project is to implement a graph-based approach for distinguishing indolent from aggressive thyroid cancer, thus pre- venting patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative functional outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Thyroid Cancer using Ultrasound Imaging,10110934,R21EB030691,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nodule', 'Nomograms', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computer aided detection', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'functional outcomes', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment', 'ward']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,224566,673201228
"A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney Project Summary  Despite the widespread prevalence of ultrasound imaging in hospitals today, the clinical utility of ultrasound guidance is severely hampered by clutter and reverberation artifacts that obscure structures of interest and com- plicate anatomical measurements. Clutter is particularly problematic in overweight and obese individuals, who account for 78.6 million adults and 12.8 million children in North America. Similarly, interventional procedures of- ten require insertion of one or more metal tools, which generate reverberation artifacts that obfuscate instrument location, orientation, and geometry, while obscuring nearby tissues, thus additionally hampering ultrasound im- age quality. Although artifacts are problematic, ultrasound continues to persist primarily because of its greatest strengths (i.e., mobility, cost, non-ionizing radiation, real-time visualization, and multiplanar views) in comparison to existing image-guidance options, but it would be signiﬁcantly more useful without problematic artifacts.  Our long-term project goal is to use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to provide interventional radiologists with artifact-free ultrasound-based images. We will initially develop a new framework alternative to the ultrasound beamforming process that removes needle tip reverberations and acoustic clutter caused by multipath scattering in near-ﬁeld tissues when guiding needles to the kidney to enable removal of painful kidney stones. Our ﬁrst aim will test convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that input raw channel data and output human readable images with no artifacts caused by multipath scattering and reverberations. A secondary goal of the CNNs is to learn the minimum number of parameters required to create these new CNN-based images. Our second aim will validate the trained algorithms with ultrasound data from experimental phantom and ex vivo tissue. Our third aim will extend our evaluation to ultrasound images of in vivo porcine kidneys. This work is the ﬁrst to propose bypassing the entire beamforming process and replacing it with machine learning and computer vision techniques to remove traditionally problematic noise artifacts and create a fundamentally new type of artifact-free, high-contrast, high-resolution, ultrasound-based image for guiding interventional procedures.  This work combines the expertise of an imaging scientist, a computer scientist, and an interventional ra- diologist to explore an untapped, understudied area that is only recently made feasible through improvements in computing power, advances in computer vision capabilities, and new knowledge about dominant sources of image degradation. Translation to in vivo cases is enabled by our clinical collaboration with the Department of Radiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. With support from the NIH Trailblazer Award, our team will be the ﬁrst to develop these tools and capabilities to eliminate noise artifacts in interventional ultrasound, opening the door to a new paradigm in ultrasound image formation, which will directly beneﬁt millions of patients with clearer, easier-to-interpret ultrasound images. Subsequent R01 funding will customize our innovation to addi- tional application-speciﬁc ultrasound procedures (e.g., breast biopsies, cancer detection, autonomous surgery). Project Narrative Artifacts in ultrasound images, speciﬁcally artifacts caused by multipath scattering and acoustic reverberations (which occur when imaging through the abdominal tissue of overweight and obese patients or visualizing metallic surgical tools), remain as a major clinical challenge. There are no existing solutions to eliminate these artifacts based on today's signal processing techniques. The goal of this project is to step away from conventional signal processing models and instead learn from raw data examples with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques that differentiate artifacts from true signals, and thereby deliver clearer, easier-to-interpret images.",A Machine Learning Alternative to Beamforming to Improve Ultrasound Image Quality for Interventional Access to the Kidney,10170765,R21EB025621,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Award', 'Breast biopsy', 'Bypass', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Family suidae', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Interventional Ultrasonography', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Metals', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Needles', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'North America', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readability', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'imaging scientist', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metallicity', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'radiologist', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,235027,807432003
"TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS PROJECT SUMMARY Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. The WHO has set a goal of controlling trachoma to a low enough level that blindness from the disease is no longer a public health concern. Control is defined as a district-level prevalence of follicular trachomatous inflammation (TF) in the upper tarsal conjunctiva of less than 5% in children, currently determined by clinical examination. While not required for the current definition, intense trachomatous inflammation (TI) correlates better with presence of the causative agent, Chlamydia trachomatis. Grading of both TF and TI vary widely between individuals, and even in the same individual over time. As cases become rarer, training new graders becomes more difficult. As areas become controlled, trachoma budgets are being cut, and the institutional knowledge of grading lost, making detection of remaining cases and potential resurgence difficult. One of the greatest obstacles to reaching our trachoma goals is an inadequate diagnostic test. The WHO relies on field grading of TF; human inconsistency, grader bias, and training costs are becoming major obstacles, but they do not need to be. We propose to test the central hypothesis that a fully automatic, deep learning grader can perform as well as trained physicians in detecting and grading trachoma. The hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific aims: 1) Automatic identification of follicles and grading of TF and 2) Automatic tarsal blood vessels detection and grading of TI. Our approach includes the development, training and testing of novel image processing pipelines based on semantic segmentation and disease classification using deep learning neural networks and state-of-the-art object detection. All of the data to be used in this study is secondary data from NEI-funded and other trachoma clinical trials conducted by our study team. We aim to facilitate widespread adoption of these novel tools across the trachoma research and grading community, by open source availability of generated code and interoperability of generated machine learning models across programming languages through use of the open neural networks exchange format. Our proposed research addresses the problem of subjectivity, cost and reliability of human trachoma grading. Successful completion of the proposed specific aims will also be a key step forward towards future study and development of providing health organizations and research teams with a novel, efficient and extensible tool to ensure objective, automated, scalable trachoma grading in the field to enhance, or in some cases replace, traditional field grading during the critical endgame of trachoma control, as well surveillance for potential resurgence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Trachoma elimination and control are major WHO goals, but success is limited by the ability to accurately identify and grade trachoma cases in the field manually by human graders, a process expensive, subjective and slow to scale up. This project seeks to perform secondary analysis by leveraging existing trachoma photograph datasets from numerous NEI-funded and other-sponsored prior randomized controlled trachoma studies in order to further develop a novel deep learning computational tool able to automatically detect and grade the active forms of trachoma in digital photographs. By employing deep learning neural networks and advanced image analysis, we propose to create a computer program with the ability to classify and grade trachoma in a way that is automatic, objective, scalable and with subsequent potential for remote grading which is auditable by regulatory agencies.",TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS,10196816,R21EY032567,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyelid structure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical examination', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'conjunctiva', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'health organization', 'image processing', 'interoperability', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'scale up', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250,685608202
"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286,524978793
"SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections Automated monitoring and screening of various physiological signals is an indispensable tool in modern medicine. However, despite the  preponderance of long-term monitoring and screening modalities for certain vital signals, there are a significant number of applications for  which no automated monitoring or screening is available. For example, patients in need of urinary catheterization are at significant risk of  urinary tract infections, but long-term monitoring for a developing infection while a urinary catheter is in place typically requires a caregiver to  frequently collect urine samples which then must be transported to a laboratory facility to be tested for a developing infection. Disruptive  technologies at the intersection of lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning offer a tremendous  opportunity to develop new devices that can be connected to a urinary catheter to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. However, novel  image reconstruction, object detection and classification, and deep learning algorithms are needed to deal with challenges such as low image  resolution, limited labeled data, and heterogeneity of the abnormalities to be detected in urine samples. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of computer scientists, engineers and clinicians to design, develop and test a system that integrates lens-free imaging, fluidics, image processing, computer vision and machine learning to automatically monitor urinary tract infections. The system will take a urine sample as an input, image the sample with a lens-free microscope as it flows through a fluidic channel, reconstruct the images using advanced holographic reconstruction algorithms, and detect and classify abnormalities, e.g., white blood cells, using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project will: (1) design fluidic and optical hardware to appropriately sample urine from patient lines, flow the sample through the lens-free imager, and capture holograms of the sample; (2) develop holographic image reconstruction algorithms based on deep network architectures constrained by the physics of light diffraction to produce high quality images of the specimen from the lens-free holograms; (3) develop deep learning algorithms requiring a minimal level of manual supervision to detect various abnormalities in the fluid sample that might be indicative of a developing infection (e.g., the presence of white bloods cells or bacteria); and (4) integrate the above hardware and software developments into a system to be validated on urine samples obtained from patient discards against standard urine monitoring and screening methods. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project could lead to the development of a low-cost device for automated screening and monitoring of urinary tract infections (the most  common hospital and nursing home acquired infection), and such a device could eliminate the need for patients or caregivers to manually collect  urine samples and transport them to a laboratory facility for testing and enable automated long-term monitoring and screening for UTIs. Early  detection of developing UTIs could allow caregivers to preemptively remove the catheter before the UTI progressed to the point of requiring  antibiotic treatment, thus reducing overall antibiotic usage. The technology to be developed in this project could also be used for screening  abnormalities in other fluids, such as central spinal fluid, and the methods to detect and classify large numbers of cells in an image could lead to  advances in large scale multi-object detection and tracking for other computer vision applications. n/a",SCH: A Computer Vision and Lens-Free Imaging System for Automatic Monitoring of Infections,10162472,R01AG067396,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteriuria', 'Caregivers', 'Catheters', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Hospital Nursing', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary Catheterization', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffraction of light', 'heterogenous data', 'hologram', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'laboratory facility', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'particle', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,283097,807432003
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms.",Can machines be trusted?

"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300,304670088
"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease,10121764,R01DK125561,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Coin', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Endoscopy', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Fever', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhagic colitis', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiration', 'Safety', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell motility', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diffusion weighted', 'economic impact', 'healing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'water diffusion']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,391320,209484975
"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction. Narrative Technological advances in histopathology imaging and computing have enabled the in-depth characterization of pathology tissues.

"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421,551214295
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi- organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10331615,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Water', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,507076,324592664
"Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  2 Nonlinear algorithms such as model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have  3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-  4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information  5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-  6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-  7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,  8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-  9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag- 10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these 11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can 12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify 13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control 14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight. 15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can 16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and 17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the 18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and, 19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance 20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung 21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom- 22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion 23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener- 24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network 25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging 26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR 27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza- 28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear 29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This 30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality 31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms. 32 PROJECT NARRATIVE Major research efforts have been devoted to the development of nonlinear reconstruction algorithms – from model-based reconstruction to deep learning, these algorithms have demonstrated many advantages such as improved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and additional diagnostic information that are not achievable with traditional linear reconstructions. However, only a disproportionately small number has reach the clinic due to the lack of a predictive image quality analysis framework to quantify diagnostic performance, control algorithm behavior, and ensure consistent performance for robust clinical deployment. The propose effort use a combination of analytic and machine learning approaches to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality to diagnostic performance and establish optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.",Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT,10121056,R01CA249538,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Beauty', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Digital Libraries', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'screening', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted imaging']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,512567,807432003
"Quantitative histopathology for cancer prognosis using quantitative phase imaging on stained tissues Summary Fast, accurate, and scalable testing has been recognized unanimously as crucial for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics. We propose a technology that allows rapid (~2 minutes) testing for SARS CoV-2. Our technology combines novel label-free imaging and dedicated deep-learning algorithms to detect and classify viral populations in exhaled air. If successful, this project will result in a device based on quantitative phase imaging and integrated AI tools, which will detect the unlabeled virus acquired by the patient’s breath condensed on a microscope slide. Toward this goal, we will advance Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), an ultrasensitive label-free imaging technique, proven to measure structures down to the sub-nanometer scale. SLIM was developed in the PI’s Lab at UIUC, its original publication received 490 citations to date, and has been commercialized by Phi Optics (Research Park, UIUC), with sales across the world in both academia and industry. Applying the computed fluorescence maps back to the QPI data, we propose to measure nanoscale features of viral particles, with high specificity, minimal preparation time, and independent of clinical infrastructure. As a result, the new technology will eventually be ideal for point-of-care settings, surveillance screening and as a home monitoring device. We anticipate that our approach will be scalable to other viruses, with new imaging and training data. Narrative We propose a breath test using label-free imaging and AI: an individual exhales on a microscope slide, which is fed into a SLIM microscope equipped with a computer that runs deep-learning pre-trained algorithms for SARS CoV-2 identification.

"Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients ABSTRACT The prevalence of obesity in the United States has risen to record levels over the past 40 years, putting strain on the healthcare system and creating difficult challenges for medical imaging. We propose to overcome the challenges that obesity poses to ultrasound imaging by (1) developing novel image-quality improvement techniques, and (2) implementing them on pulse-echo ultrasound imaging systems to yield high-quality images of the liver. Ultrasound imaging is uniquely affected by the presence of additional connective tissue and thick subcutaneous fat layers in overweight and obese patients; these additional subcutaneous layers greatly exacerbate reverberation and phase-aberration of the acoustic wave, leading to high levels of clutter, degraded resolution, and overall poor-quality ultrasound images. Our proposed methods will determine the local speed-of-sound in abdominal tissue layers and use this information to accomplish distributed phase-aberration correction. We also apply machine learning techniques to model and suppress the effects of reverberation clutter and speckle noise. The combination of these techniques is expected to achieve significant improvements in liver image quality. These image-quality improvement methods will be implemented on a real-time ultrasound scanner and will be evaluated in clinical imaging tasks of overweight and obese patients undergoing ultrasound surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Successful development of the proposed technology will not only enable high-quality ultrasound imaging of the liver in otherwise difficult-to-image overweight and obese patients, but also facilitate improved image quality across nearly all ultrasound imaging applications, for all populations. NARRATIVE This proposal aims to develop and test several new techniques to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound to make high-quality images in overweight and obese individuals. These novel ultrasound techniques will be initially applied to improve liver imaging in overweight and obese patients in a pilot study, though the benefits of this new high-quality imaging technology will extend to all other areas of clinical ultrasound imaging.",Improving Liver Ultrasound Image Quality in Difficult-to-Image Patients,10236260,R01EB027100,"['Abdomen', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Cardiac', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Overweight', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Weight', 'clinical imaging', 'elastography', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'high body mass index', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'liver imaging', 'neural network', 'novel', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'simulation', 'sound', 'subcutaneous']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,585234,560644462
"Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo 1 Dermatologists rely on visual (clinical widefield) and dermoscopic examination of skin lesions to guide the need  2 for biopsy. With this approach, sensitivity is high, but specificity tends to be quite variable and lower, resulting  3 in millions of biopsies of benign lesions every year. To improve specificity, several optical technologies are  4 being developed to noninvasively detect skin cancer. Of these, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is the  5 furthest advanced in clinical utility, proven for diagnosing skin cancers with high sensitivity and specificity.  6 RCM imaging, guided by dermoscopy, detects skin cancers with 2 times superior specificity, and reduces the  7 benign-to-malignant biopsy rate by 2 times, compared to that with dermoscopy alone. In 2016, the Centers for  8 Medicare and Medicaid Services granted current procedural terminology (CPT) reimbursement codes for RCM  9 imaging of skin. RCM imaging combined with dermoscopy is now advancing into clinical practice, sparing pa- 10 tients from unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. However, toward widespread acceptance and adoption, a 11 key challenge is that clinical widefield examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as 12 three separate procedures with separate devices. Clinicians do not precisely know the location of RCM imag- 13 es relative to the surrounding contextual lesion morphology that is seen with clinical widefield examination and 14 dermoscopy, resulting in lower and more variable diagnostic accuracy (particularly, sensitivity, positive and 15 negative predictive values). We propose a novel solution: (i) a new objective lens with an integrated micro- 16 camera, to deliver a concurrent widefield image of the skin surface surrounding the location of RCM imaging; 17 (ii) a new software algorithm for widefield image-based tracking of the location of RCM images within a dermoscopic 18 field of view; (iii) a new diagnostic approach that will proactively use widefield imaging to locate RCM images in 19 dermoscopic images. We intend to deliver this integrated widefield clinical, dermoscopic and RCM imaging ap- 20 proach into the clinic, toward a new standard for more accurate, consistent and faster RCM imaging to guide 21 patient care. Preliminary studies with a “mock” objective lens and micro-camera on a bench-top set-up 22 demonstrated excellent optical sectioning (~2 µm) and resolution (~1 µm) for RCM imaging, and accurate and 23 repeatable location of RCM fields-of-view within the widefield image. RCM images showed excellent cellular 24 and morphologic detail in vivo. Our specific aims are (1) to develop a handheld reflectance confocal micro- 25 scope with integrated widefield camera; (2) to develop image processing algorithms for real-time widefield im- 26 aging-guided tracking of RCM image locations within dermoscopic fields; (3) to test and validate performance 27 on 100 patients. Although our proposition is for skin lesions, the research will surely have wider impact for 28 imaging in other settings, particularly, with miniaturized confocal microscopes and endoscopes, which have 29 very small fields-of-view. We are a highly synergistic team from Montana State University, Memorial Sloan 30 Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and Caliber Imaging and Diagnostics (formerly, Lucid Inc.). RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Clinical examination and dermoscopy combined with reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging is a newly emerging optical imaging procedure that can noninvasively guide diagnosis of skin cancers, and reduce the need for biopsy. However, clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM imaging are currently performed as three separate procedures with separate devices, limiting effectiveness and impact. We propose a device to combine the three into a single procedure, which will help dermatologists and patients by making the skin examinations quicker, more accurate and more consistent, expanding the impact of this proven approach.",Simultaneous coaxial widefield imaging and reflectance confocal microscopy for improved diagnosis of skin cancers in vivo,10127641,R01EB028752,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Current Procedural Terminology', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermatology', 'Dermis', 'Dermoscopy', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Effectiveness', 'Endoscopes', 'Engineering', 'Epidermis', 'Grant', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lesion', 'Lesion by Morphology', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicaid services', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Montana', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'lens', 'medical specialties', 'microscopic imaging', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'optical imaging', 'prospective test', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skin lesion', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R01,2021,589357,20627506
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found a decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Prefrontal white matter is among the areas usually involved. Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities, suggesting that abnormalities causing diminished FA are subtle, and that postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a FIC/NIMH collaboration with the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the spatial orientation of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high- resolution images of Bielschowsky stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This technique yields clear images of individual axons that can be traced and measured in 3 dimensions. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin- related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models in three multi-omics data fusion approaches to combine different types of high-dimensional data, including those produced by Aims 1 and 2, with known structural properties of axons and myelin in white matter, in order to build a model or detect novel dependencies of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. NARRATIVE Our ongoing research in North Macedonia and at Columbia University / New York State Psychiatric Institute has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale to study schizophrenia.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research,10099068,R01MH125030,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interviewer', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'New York', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Optic Nerve', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Shotguns', 'Silver Staining', 'Space Perception', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'precursor cell', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'symposium', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,641403,68331629
"Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance PROGRAM SUMMARY Radiological imaging is often the first step of the diagnostic pathway for many devastating diseases; thus, an erroneous assessment of “normal” can lead to death. Whereas a grayscale object in an image can be described by its first-order image statistics—such as contrast, spatial frequency, position, entropy, and orientation—none of these dimensions, by itself, indicates abnormal vs normal radiological findings. We are a highly diverse team proposing an empirical approach to determine the mixtures of the first-order statistics—the “visual textures”— that radiology experts explicitly and implicitly use to identify the locations of potential abnormalities in medical images. Our innovative approach does not rely on assumptions about which textures may or may not be im- portant to abnormality detection. Instead, we will track the oculomotor behavior of expert radiologists to deter- mine their conscious and unconscious targeting choices, and thus ascertain which textures are empirically in- formative. The ability of expert radiologists to rapidly find abnormalities suggests that they may be able to first identify them in their retinal periphery. Peripheral visual analysis skills are therefore potentially critical to radio- logic performance, despite being understudied. We will measure these skills and leverage the results to develop perceptual learning heuristics to improve peripheral abnormality texture detection. By comparing novices to ex- perts we will determine whether the first are inexpert due to a lack of sensitivity to diagnostically relevant textures (texture informativeness), or to a lack of knowledge about which textures are abnormal, or to a combined lack of both sensitivity and knowledge. Radiology also requires the acquisition of oculomotor skills through practice and optimization. Radiologic expertise thus changes the oculomotor system in predictable and detectable ways, in much the same way that an athlete’s body and brain change as a function of expertise acquisition in their sport. We will therefore analyze both the consistency between experts’ fixation choices in medical images, and the eye movement performance characteristics of experts vs novice radiologists, to create an objective oculomotor bi- omarker of radiological expertise. The differences between novices and experts will train a deep learning (DL) system, which will have human visual and oculomotor performance characteristics. Training the DL with the abnormalities identified by a panel of expert radiologists will allow it to pinpoint the possible solutions in the manner of a simulated human radiologist performing at peak accuracy, precision, and speed. The resulting rank- ordered list of possible optimal and suboptimal image-reading strategies will serve as a benchmarking tool to quantify the performance of actual clinicians and residents who read the same images, rested vs fatigued. Meas- uring the effects of both training and fatigue on radiology expertise will be a major interdisciplinary cross-cutting advance in performance assessment. Our proposal to quantify fatigue in terms of erosion of expertise represents a transformational advance towards objective fitness-for-duty and expertise measures in medicine and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are 25-32 million perceptual errors in radiological case studies worldwide each year, contributing to med- ical error, the third most common cause of death in the US. We seek to reduce detection errors in radiology with four innovations: (1) we will empirically and objectively determine the visual textures used by expert radiologists to identify abnormalities within medical images; (2) we will determine the ways in which expert radiologists use their eyes, and especially their peripheral vision, to scan images and target informative regions; (3) we will de- velop a perceptual learning paradigm to optimally train residents in both texture perception and oculomotor per- formance domains; and (4) we will construct a deep learning model bestowed with simulated human visual and oculomotor capabilities, to create a normative model of human radiological expertise. The combined results from these studies will quantify peak expert performance and be employed to track and enhance individual expertise acquisition during radiology training; thus, the proposed research will help reduce medical error and moreover provide objective fitness-for-duty measurement tools—based on quantified biomarkers—to evaluate and ame- liorate the effects of fatigue on radiologic performance.",Novel Perceptual and Oculomotor Heuristics for Enhancing Radiologic Performance,10220201,R01CA258021,"['Assessment tool', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'Cancer Detection', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Collection', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Sports', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'heuristics', 'human error', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'lung imaging', 'meetings', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'oculomotor behavior', 'pandemic disease', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'shift work', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development']",NCI,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,646124,27165390
"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046,294146927
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,790095,550947887
"Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence Summary / Abstract Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout), DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound, calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims — To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for both clinical use and precision medicine research. Project Narrative Medical imaging is critical to almost every type of diagnostic and management decision, but human interpretation of medical images can lack accuracy and reproducibility. By developing machine learning methods for analyzing medical images, the work in our proposal can improve diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging, for both clinical and research uses.",Improving cardiovascular image-based phenotyping using emerging methods in artificial intelligence,10136081,R01HL150394,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Apical', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Heart', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computerized data processing', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection test', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'heart imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repaired', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,821265,685608202
"Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) ABSTRACT: The intersection of healthcare and biomedical research is at an inflection point with the convergence of the digital revolution, advances in imaging, nanotechnology, big data science, and precision or personalized medicine. There is a wealth of meaningful, but complex information that could be extracted from imaging data but is not optimally utilized for patient care. Cancer care exemplifies the current challenges which include early detection, accurate distinction of pre- neoplastic and neoplastic lesions, prediction of tumor aggressiveness, determining infiltrative tumor margins during surgical treatment, tracking tumor evolution/ metastasis pattern, recurrence, and potential acquired resistance to treatments over time. Major strides have been made in the personalization of cancer therapies such as immunotherapy, but the availability of specific, relevant, and timely medical data and information is of critical importance to realizing the full potential of precision medicine. Nowhere is this more acutely evident than during interventions in the operating and procedure rooms. Novel methods of image guidance, data integration, information extraction, and knowledge transfer are needed to enable clinicians to fully leverage the information available, especially before, during and after invasive procedures. We are excited to re-submit a proposal for a new P41 biomedical resource center (BTRC) called Advanced Technologies for NCIGT(AT-NCIGT) with 3 TRDs, 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects, all of which aim to investigate develop and disseminate new technologies for image guided therapy (IGT). The 3 components are Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity for IGT, Deep Learning for IGT and Intraoperative devices for IGT. These new technologies alone and in combinations will allow for greater understanding of disease state, treatment guidance, integration/navigation and in-vivo monitoring of tissue responses and improve the precision of invasive procedures. Thus the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate, develop and disseminate novel technologies for extracting new tissue characteristics (technology research and development core TRD 1: Imaging cancer heterogeneity; analyze them and make them available through state-of-the-art algorithmic and data curation approaches (Deep Learning TRD 2); and enable precise tissue sampling surgical navigation and in-vivo tissue response through the results of novel Intraoperative devices (Intraoperative devices for IGT: TRD 3). In order to effectively disseminate all this new knowledge we have 10 new collaborative and 10 new service projects and will share these novel tools through our established mechanisms, from current BTRC- National Center for Image Guided Therapy (NCIGT), which continues to be dedicated to the innovating for IGT into interventional radiology, surgery, radiation oncology, and procedure-based medicine. Project Narrative The Advanced Technologies-National Center for Image guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT) is a research and technology center with the mission of advancing patient care, by developing novel innovative tools for image guided Therapy (IGT). The three technologies encompass Imaging Cancer Heterogeneity, Deep learning and Intraoperative devices for image guided therapy which will be investigated both individually and in cross TR &D combinations. We will disseminate all technologies through a national network of collaborators, making these discoveries available to the larger medical community.",Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT),10090279,P41EB028741,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Augmented Reality', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Conventional Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Navigation System', 'Needles', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biomedical resource', 'brain surgery', 'cancer care', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'ion mobility', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolic imaging', 'microdevice', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overtreatment', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prostate biopsy', 'protocol development', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'technology research and development', 'tissue oxygenation', 'tool', 'trait', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,P41,2021,1527478,327644200
