"A portable photoacoustic imager for diagnosing vascular diseases Project Summary/Abstract Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of- care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage. A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.  A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation, plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting humans of all ages, including infants.  In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable vascular imaging metrics.  In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.  The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings of the world. Project Narrative Vascular diseases are becoming epidemic with increase in aging population, obesity and type II diabetes. They affect humans of all age groups, including neonates.

"Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics Abstract Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Synthetic Biology: At the Crossroads of Genetic Engineering and Human Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Jose M. Lora and Timothy K. Lu. The conference will be held in Breckenridge, Colorado from March 29- April 1, 2019. Synthetic Biology tools and principles have matured tremendously over the last decade and have reached extraordinary levels of sophistication, both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Synthetic biology as a therapeutic modality is starting to enter multiple clinical studies and has the potential to have a significant impact on medicine across a wide range of diseases (e.g., metabolic, immune-mediated, cancer, and neurologic diseases). This Keystone Symposia conference will delve into the field of synthetic biology with a special emphasis on its applications to medicine. While there are conferences that capture synthetic biology in only a few talks mixed in among other various topics, there is a paucity of conferences focused on synthetic biology as drugs to treat disease. However, due to the rapid pace of fundamental scientific advances along with an expanding number of biotechnology companies and emerging clinical studies with synthetic biology at their core, this conference will be highly relevant for a wide audience of scientists both from academia and industry. In addition, other meetings in this field have a highly technology-driven focus on synthetic biology techniques with relatively little attention given to biological and medical context. Ultimately, this Keystone Symposia conference should inspire researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss synthetic biology via many new angles. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past two decades, tremendous advances have been made in the use of biological parts to engineer systems that can effectively direct living cells for a vast variety of purposes (a.k.a. synthetic biology). Synthetic biology is being used to construct more effective therapies in diseases such as cancer, but there are remaining obstacles to the clinical translation of these therapies.

"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression. Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression.,9861881,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,21455,69391728,-0.004088319248200243
"Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics Project Summary  Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most lethal hematologic malignancy in childhood, with a probability of 5-year survival at only 60%. Most children diagnosed with AML initially respond well to standard chemotherapy; however, nearly 40% eventually develop relapsed disease, which responds poorly to treatment and is fatal in the majority of patients. Although age at diagnosis, response to induction chemotherapy, and cytogenetic status have been identified as coarse prognostic factors in pediatric AML, it is still unclear what molecular features lead certain patients to relapse over others. Thus, developing an enhanced understanding of the mechanistic drivers underlying relapse in pediatric AML represents a significant area of clinical need.  Many reports indicate that there are rare, hematopoietic stem cell-like subpopulations in AML patients that resist chemotherapy and drive relapse. However, the exact characteristics of these relapse-associated cells—often called “leukemic stem cells” (LSCs)—are a matter of contention, with reported phenotypes spanning much of the known hematopoietic developmental continuum and differing significantly between patients and throughout the course of disease. As such, the identity and importance of these relapse-associated cells as well as their relationship to normal hematopoietic developmental processes remain mysterious.  The proposed project will examine the relationship between single-cell AML phenotypes, clinical outcomes, and normal myeloid development in 60 clinically-annotated primary samples from pediatric AML patients in order to identify relapse-associated cellular subtypes. To achieve this, we will leverage the versatility of mass cytometry, a 40-parameter single-cell proteomics platform, and machine learning in simultaneously studying the complex surface and signaling phenotypes of millions of leukemic cells from patients’ diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples relative to healthy controls. Central hypothesis: We hypothesize that high-dimensional molecular profiling of primary AML cells will reveal consistent, functional phenotypes associated with relapse-driving subpopulations that computationally align with particular stages of healthy hematopoietic development and represent points of future therapeutic intervention. Aim 1: Develop methods to computationally align high-dimensional, single-cell AML phenotypes with their  most analogous developmental state along the healthy myeloid continuum. Aim 2: Utilize predictive modeling to determine the surface, signaling, and functional phenotype of AML  subpopulations predicting relapse and functionally validate these characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Project Narrative: For reasons that remain poorly understood, nearly 40% of the roughly 500 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year in the United States will experience relapse after initially responding to treatment. To better characterize why some AML patients relapse while others do not, the proposed project will use state-of-the-art molecular profiling approaches to characterize millions of primary AML cells and their computational “alignment” with healthy hematopoietic development. These data will be used to construct a method of predicting at diagnosis which patients have a high risk of relapse in order to identify prognostically important cell populations that represent future therapeutic targets in the management of pediatric AML.",Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics,9994724,F31CA239365,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cox Models', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Event', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'molecular subtypes', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stem-like cell', 'therapeutic target']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,39490,560644462,-0.022672216498453437
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN. Our findings will reveal potential clinical biomarkers of HTN and inform the development of microbiome-based therapeutic strategies against the development of HTN.",Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension.,9990103,F31HL152495,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Career Choice', 'Cause of Death', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Dahl Hypertensive Rats', 'Data', 'Desulfovibrio', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family suidae', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Sulfide', 'Hypertension', 'Immunology', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Lactobacillus helveticus', 'Latina', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbiology', 'Milk', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Research', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Shotguns', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Supplementation', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alternative treatment', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical biomarkers', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hypertension treatment', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'modifiable risk', 'mutant', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prolyl-proline', 'prolylisoleucine', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'salt sensitive', 'salt sensitive hypertension', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'sulfate reducing bacteria', 'tool', 'urinary']",NHLBI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,F31,2020,45520,122662885,-0.00030899746380761816
"Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy ABSTRACT In this proposal I am interested in developing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling approach for volumetric assessment of human uteroplacental blood flow in vivo. The placenta is an organ that exchanges nutrients and oxygen between the maternal circulation and the growing fetus. In the United States, about 3.4% of pregnancies per year are affected by hypertensive pregnancy disorders (HPD) such as preeclampsia (PE), which have been found to carry both fetal and maternal risk. Associated placental pathologies are believed to be linked to alterations in maternal arterial remodeling. Currently, Doppler ultrasound (US) is the primary method of assessing flow to the placenta from the uterine artery (UtA). Clinical studies have shown a relationship between high UtA flow resistance and risk of adverse pregnancy outcome late in gestation, but it has not been reliable as an early gestation screening tool. In order to improve predictive technologies for reliable risk assessment assessment of HPD, more research into the relationship between vessel structure and function in the UtA is needed. I hypothesize that CFD modeling can be a useful tool for investigating possible pathophysiological mechanisms of HPD by simulating complex hemodynamics of the maternal vascular system including pressure, wall shear stress, and pulse wave velocity. I plan to set up various 1D CFD simulations to understand the hemodynamic parameters of normal versus abnormal pregnancies. Then, I will validate the simulations with 4D flow MRI acquired from an in vitro flow phantom and a cohort of normal and hypertensive pregnant women. I anticipate that the results of this investigation can advance scientific knowledge regarding the progression of early HPD phenotypes to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This CFD study can also demonstrate the extent to which patient-specific hemodynamic simulations can be reliable for future improvement of clinical management. This training experience will provide opportunities to build my expertise in cardiovascular physiology, fluid mechanics, medical imaging, data analysis, and clinical care. I will be publishing articles on my CFD/4D flow MRI findings and communicating the impact of this work in medicine at various internal and external symposia. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of award-winning experts and the University of Pennsylvania in cardiovascular MRI (Walter Witschey), fluid mechanics and computational modeling (Paris Perdikaris), maternal fetal medicine (Nadav Schwartz) and cardiovascular physiology (Victor Ferrari). PROJECT NARRATIVE The human placenta is an understudied organ believed to play a critical role in pregnancy health and the pathophysiology of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Current technologies like ultrasound are limited in its ability to assess complex hemodynamics, and clinical studies have not yet found reliable biomarkers of adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will develop a computational fluid dynamic model of the maternal vessels delivering blood to the placenta and validate it with magnetic resonance imaging to characterize uteroplacental structure and function, providing future avenues for new predictive biomarkers of pregnancy health.",Modeling and Assessment of Maternal Uteroplacental Circulation During Pregnancy,9991192,F31HD100171,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electric Capacitance', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Navier–Stokes equations', 'Nutrient', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Paris, France', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placentation', 'Play', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Uteroplacental Circulation', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Vascular System', 'Velocimetries', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'arterial remodeling', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'fetal', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal risk', 'neural network', 'non-invasive imaging', 'phantom model', 'predictive marker', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pressure', 'screening', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'symposium', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,593605914,0.004623961906433604
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,560644462,-0.03696310441456903
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9961678,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2020,75097,193405667,0.004623720919143887
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,254622553,-0.010185240203625653
"Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that is difficult to manage clinically, because it is characterized by unpredictable periods of remission and relapse. If the disease could be adequately monitored, it is possible drugs could intervene to prevent damage, reducing rates of relapse and overall progression. Ideally, it would be possible to repeatedly biopsy the CNS for monitoring, but this is too challenging/morbid to have utility. Herein, we propose an approach that harnesses tissue engineering principles to develop an immunological niche (IN) in vivo to enable harvest of physiologically relevant immune populations. The central hypothesis of this work is that INs can be created to reflect aspects of the innate and/or adaptive immune system that correlate with the CNS. Furthermore, we hypothesize that INs will provide a location into which a non-invasive optical sensor of multiple sclerosis can be implanted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the FBR to implanted materials can be harnessed to create an IN reflective of innate immunity in the CNS and will dynamically monitor the formation of this niche. Scaffolds will be excised at appropriate time points during disease induction and analyzed with high-throughput gene expression arrays, scRNAseq, and machine learning to develop multivariate signatures capable of determining whether a mouse is diseased or healthy. Aim 2 (K99) will harness specific antigen-binding peptides to build noninvasive sensors for biomarkers of disease progression. Fluorophore-labeled peptides that specifically bind biomarkers of disease will be incorporated into PEG hydrogels which will be engineered such that the binding of the desired antigen will enable detection via FRET. These sensors will be incorporated into the pores of the IN to enable non-invasive monitoring of MS. Aim 3 (R00) will develop INs reflective of adaptive immune populations in the CNS, by incorporating antigens within the scaffolds. This section will create a non-invasive sensor and multivariate signature reflective of adaptive immune changes within the surrogates and harness both innate and adaptive INs to investigate mechanistic questions about innate-adaptive crosstalk in the development of MS. Taken together these studies will create engineered immunological niches and non-invasive sensors that enable the creation of enhanced diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitors, and longitudinal immunology studies without euthanasia.  This work is at the intersection of immunology and biomaterials and will require biomaterials synthesis, scRNAseq, computational analysis, tissue engineering, immunology, and biosensor design and validation. The applicant has significant experience in biomaterials, tissue engineering, and the host response, but requires further training in immunology, computational analysis, and biosensor design/validation. Both this award and the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise to begin his career as an independent investigator. Furthermore, this work will develop new diagnostics, new techniques useful to the field as a whole, and contribute to an understanding of unanswered questions in innate-adaptive crosstalk in autoimmunity. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune infiltrate into the CNS and subsequent damage to myelin, that is difficult to diagnose and monitor because the site for disease cannot be readily biopsied for analysis. The goal of this proposal is to create engineered immunological niches and corresponding non- invasive sensors that will correlate with the innate or adaptive immune responses during disease onset and progression by implanting engineered scaffolds in the subcutaneous space. The implications of this work are broad including diagnostics, prognostics, treatment monitoring tools, and research tools to enable longitudinal isolation of disease-inducing cells or non-invasive protein measurements from a single host without euthanasia.",Immulogical Niches and Non-invasive Biosensors for Autoimmune Monitoring,10054726,K99EB028840,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biosensor', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Euthanasia', 'Event', 'Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis', 'Extravasation', 'Flare', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Foreign Bodies', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homing', 'Hydrogels', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Implant', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'Natural Immunity', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuraxis', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Phagocytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteolipids', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Harvesting', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'caprolactone', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'fluorophore', 'glucose monitor', 'imaging approach', 'immunoengineering', 'immunological status', 'implant material', 'implanted sensor', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'liquid biopsy', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'optical sensor', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'small molecule', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2020,91800,641965656,-0.03607466519062099
"A Multi-Omic Platform for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Characterization and Management Project Summary/Abstract Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Due to the complex nature of PCOS, diagnosis is often delayed and options for treatment and self-management are limited. With recent developments in high-throughput, next- generation and metabolomics technologies, there is now a unique opportunity to utilize a cost- effective, multi-omic approach to study individuals with PCOS. In this application, we propose to apply these technologies to examine women with PCOS, developing a platform that is cost-effective, scalable, integrative, and highly accurate. Our multi- omic platform (FemBio) will integrate patient’s medical records, genomics, microbiome (shotgun metagenomics), and metabolomics to create a molecular profile of women with and without PCOS. This approach has the potential to provide a more comprehensive characterization of PCOS, to lead to the identification of improved diagnostic markers, and to allow for the discovery of novel targets for treatment. Moreover, we propose a prospective observational cohort study including whole genome sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome, fecal metabolomics, serum and urine hormone levels, and clinical indices in a sample of individuals with PCOS and a healthy control group. This platform (FemBio) will enable broader accessibility to the latest in molecular assays, multi- omic quantification, and computational modeling for the general public, which currently is lacking. In turn, this will improve options for PCOS characterization, long-term management, and open potentially new treatment options for the millions of women suffering from this disorder, as well as serve as a large, annotated multi-omic data set that can help the PCOS field more broadly.

"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs.

"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding.

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9853783,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2020,167900,593605914,-0.004148661055060047
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,673201228,0.007843286900440284
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,550947887,-0.04833961799757414
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9852330,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,178949,76545728,-0.016622598894974437
"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,10019544,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2020,179885,92601146,0.008529331543363385
"Developing a virtual placenta biobank Project Summary / Abstract The placenta is the first organ to develop and functions as the fetal lung, kidney, gut, skin, immune and endocrine systems. It is the cause of, and reflects changes from, most diseases in pregnancy, yet remains understudied. This career development proposal will train me in the tools and practice of digital pathology, while I apply them to the placenta with the hypothesis that there are reproducible, quantitative changes in the placenta that can be modeled and used to identify abnormalities via artificial intelligence (AI). I will create a publicly available atlas of microscopically normal placentas from throughout the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Whole slide imaging will be performed on microscopic slides of placentas from the beginning of the 2nd trimester (13 weeks) through post-term (42 weeks). I will lead a team to annotate tissue type, structures, and cells. Algorithms will be trained to replicate the manual annotations. To study the changes in the placenta over time, automated measurements will be performed to identify changes in shape, size, and cellularity of placental structures that correlate with gestational age. This research can be used to develop a model of placental development and study prematurity. I will demonstrate detection of diseases of pregnancy, using preeclampsia (PreE) as an example. Placentas with microscopic changes classically seen in PreE will be scanned and annotated and algorithms trained and tested to identify them. Like many diseases of pregnancy, placental changes in PreE are variable and sometimes absent. Slides from PreE cases with no microscopic abnormalities will be scanned and examined using the quantitative parameters developed for normal placentas, testing the hypothesis that one or more of them will significantly differ between PreE cases and gestational age- matched controls. I am an Assistant Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University with an emerging focus in informatics and machine learning for diseases of pregnancy. The mentor for this project is Lee D.A. Cooper, PhD, an expert in digital pathology and machine learning. The co-mentor is David M. Aronoff, MD, an expert in maternal-child health. Mentor and co-mentor both have a history of NIH funding and graduating mentees to independence. The advisory committee consists of a digital pathology expert (Gutman), a pediatrician (Mestan) and a pathologist physician scientist (Yang). They have proposed an aggressive schedule of one-on-one meetings, coursework, seminars, and scientific meetings to supplement learning by doing the science. Completion of these studies will build my expertise in the application of machine learning to placental pathology while creating a new, publicly- accessible tool for the rapid assessment and understanding of organ structure and function with great potential to improve maternal-child health. Project Narrative The placenta grows over the course of gestation from a single layer of cells to a complex organ that acts as the fetal skin, lung, gut, kidney, immune system, and endocrine system. This project will develop an online repository of placenta microscopic images over the course of gestation from normal placentas and one disease of pregnancy, preeclampsia. Using artificial intelligence to quantitatively describe the changes over time in normal placentas and those with disease could help understand preterm birth and diseases of pregnancy.",Developing a virtual placenta biobank,10040733,K08EB030120,"['Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellularity', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decidual Cell', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Elements', 'Endocrine system', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Feeds', 'Fetal Lung', 'Fibrinoid necrosis', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemosiderosis', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infarction', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Radar', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Shapes', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Umbilical cord structure', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Villous', 'Villus', 'Yang', 'algorithm training', 'biobank', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chorionic plate', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'fetal', 'health of the mother', 'improved', 'interest', 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'novel', 'online repository', 'pediatrician', 'premature', 'professor', 'supplemental instruction', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'virtual', 'whole slide imaging']",NIBIB,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2020,185630,367414121,-0.005760495305478924

The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9861218,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2020,189950,19926766,-0.0005389180644661254
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9975724,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,191195,807432003,-0.02786856125091101
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9999688,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192564,507546965,0.0041070163449094905
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,10018932,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal maturation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preterm newborn', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,193125,230060143,-0.0011476023635718408
"Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality in children worldwide. Difficulty in obtaining sputum and a low sputum bacillary load are major barriers to diagnosis, and necessitate the development of a non-sputum, biomarker-based assay for childhood intrathoracic TB disease. Host biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires a greater focus on downstream proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are more likely to be specific to a disease phenotype and can be more easily translated into a point-of-care test. With the support of this K23 award, Dr. Devan Jaganath will identify a host proteomic biosignature in urine that can achieve the goal accuracy for a triage and/or diagnostic test for pulmonary TB in children. To complete this objective, he will leverage an ongoing prospective cohort of symptomatic children being evaluated for intrathoracic TB in Kampala, Uganda, with the extensive proteomic facilities available at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In Aim 1, he will perform targeted mass spectrometry on urine samples from children with confirmed vs. unlikely TB, and examine the abundance and ubiquitylation of 10 host proteins that have prior evidence of specific interactions with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins as candidate biomarkers. In Aim 2, he will use shotgun mass spectrometry on the urine samples to identify all host proteins and their PTMs that can differentiate TB status as novel biomarkers, and perform pathway analysis to determine the subset with functional relevance to Mtb pathogenesis. In Aim 3, he will apply machine learning analyses to identify the smallest combination of biomarkers that can achieve the target accuracy thresholds for a triage and/or diagnostic test for intrathoracic TB disease. He will then evaluate the performance of promising biosignatures in an independent, prospectively enrolled test set. Through this approach, Dr. Jaganath seeks to optimize biomarker discovery for childhood TB diagnosis by coupling prospective clinical cohorts with a targeted and untargeted high-throughput approach to comprehensively examine non-sputum samples for host biomarkers for children. Dr. Jaganath's career goal is to be a physician scientist who translates non-sputum biomarkers into clinical tools that can improve the care of children with TB. To support his path to independence, the proposed work will be paired with a dedicated, multidisciplinary mentorship team and training in international pediatric TB biomarker studies, bioinformatics for proteomic analysis, and machine learning. UCSF is an outstanding environment that is committed to junior investigators with extensive resources for research and career development, and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda is a leader in pediatric TB research, and has the established infrastructure for ongoing enrollment and sample collection. The findings will support an NIH R01 application to validate the biomarkers and biosignatures in large, diverse cohorts in comparison to existing non-sputum diagnostics. Thus, the K23 award will provide Dr. Jaganath with the critical mentorship, training, resources and experience to become an independent investigator who can make important contributions to the field of childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than half of the estimated tuberculosis (TB) disease cases in children worldwide have not been reported to the health system, and 96% of pediatric TB deaths are in children not started on treatment. The proposed project seeks to address the key barriers in diagnosing pulmonary TB in children through discovery of a host proteomic biosignature in urine. The findings will be relevant to the public health efforts to reduce the burden of TB in children and will support the development of a non-invasive, non-sputum based assay for childhood TB disease at the point-of-care.",Host Proteomic Biosignatures for a Urine-based Diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Children,10038668,K23HL153581,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Hospital Referrals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'point of care', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'research and development', 'sample collection', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,209400,685608202,-0.018772640973999246
"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Arthritis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuous Infusion', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ions', 'Isoleucine', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Price', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transistors', 'Trypsin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disulfide bond', 'electron energy', 'encryption', 'experience', 'fragment X', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'operation', 'preservation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'signal processing', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,959155,-0.04975292852004299
"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'machine learning method', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,234000,673201228,0.017203016216781695
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,685608202,-0.1263042432141407
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,161094826,-0.02814782736438329
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10107688,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2020,256550,533302350,-0.041049620521359124
"Signature of profiling and staging the progression of TB from infection to disease. Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). More than 10.4 million new cases of active TB disease develop annually, leading to 1.4 million deaths due to the disease each year. Despite widespread efforts to study of the etiology of disease, the development and global introduction of an effective treatment regimen, and sensitive diagnostics for identifying pulmonary TB disease, efforts to control this pandemic are falling short, largely due to a lack of a clear understanding of the pathogenic progression from MTB infection to active clinical disease. In addition, Existing gene expression studies have presented more than three dozen biomarkers to predict TB related outcomes such as identifying active TB disease, predicting risk of treatment failure, or predicting which patients will progress to active TB disease. These have been developed and refined using multiple technologies and using a diverse set of computational and machine learning prediction algorithms, but most are focused on two-class comparison (e.g. TB vs. LTBI). In this proposal, we propose to compile and harmonize dozens of existing RNA-sequencing datasets for TB outcomes. We will use these compiled data to develop a computational platform and interactive visualization tools for profiling TB signatures across all existing datasets. We plan to use this curated data and software platform to develop a more refined molecular map of progression from TB infection to active disease. Consistent with a recently presented models for TB disease development, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify gene expression patterns associated with stages on the TB disease spectrum, including: uninfected or eliminated infection, controlled or truly latent infection, future progressors or incipient disease, subclinical TB disease, and active clinical TB disease. We believe that existing gene expression data and signatures will allow us to identify distinct transcriptional profiles for each stage, and hence develop a multi-class machine learning approach for classifying patients into their corresponding stage. Overall, this proposal contributes to the field by compiling existing gene expression data and developing a wholistic map of TB progression from infection to active disease. In addition, we will provide a curated dataset and metadata in an accessible format for more than three dozen existing TB studies, and allow others to access and explore these data through a user-friendly profiling platform.

"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease PROJECT SUMMARY One-third of all women of reproductive age will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain at some point in their lives and one-third of outpatient visits to gynecologists in the U.S. are for evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. For many women, these symptoms accompany infertility which is reported in ~10% of all US women and even higher percentages worldwide. For almost all of these women, these conditions result in a diagnostic odyssey wherein women struggle through multiple physicians over many years for a definitive diagnosis, frequently culminating in invasive laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C) for definitive diagnosis. To reduce the burden of diagnosis and enable early treatment, MDDx, Inc. is developing the first biomarker- based diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four of the most common causes which together result in chronic pain, uterine bleeding and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. MDDx, Inc. has been leveraging access to >12 years of longitudinally collected and deeply annotated biobanked uterine lavage samples from the Gynecologic Cancer Translational Research Program (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; New York, NY and Nuvance Health; Danbury, CT) to identify diagnostic autoantibodies (AAb) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for these benign gynecological diseases. By performing AAb profiling against the entire human proteome and applying our novel machine-learning based method for classification of molecular profiles we have determined that there is a common set of ~200 biomarkers that could be used to diagnose women with adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, or endometriosis. The goal of Phase I is to finalize and validate the optimized set of ~200 diagnostic AAbs, while Phase II will focus on validation of the commercial diagnostic assay. In Aim 1 we will expand our proprietary database of uterine lavage autoantibody profiles to ensure that we have a sample size (~935) that will enable us to confidently apply our machine learning approaches to identifying the minimal panel of AAbs for the diagnostic. We will use this enhanced database to identify a prototype panel of ~200 AAbs for construction of classification scoring functions to distinguish between adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. In Aim 2 we will perform a blinded validation and performance study using an independent set of 300 uterine lavage samples to provide proof-of- concept for clinically useful sensitivity and specificity prior to large scale prospective validation in Phase II. Successful completion of this Phase I program will identify the optimized panel of AAbs for an affordable, laboratory-based diagnostic test that will significantly reduce the number of women who will need to undergo laparoscopy or hysteroscopy with D&C for definitive diagnosis, enabling early treatment of disease and reducing the significant psychological and financial burden of diagnoses that otherwise can take years. PROJECTIVE NARRATIVE Nearly half of all women of reproductive age will experience some combination of nonmenstrual pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility in their lifetimes, yet there are no non-invasive methods to definitively diagnose the primary causes of these symptoms. MDDx, Inc. is developing the first laboratory diagnostic test to enable minimally invasive simultaneous diagnosis of four common causes of these often debilitating symptoms and infertility: adenomyosis, endometrial polyps, leiomyoma, and endometriosis. This test will enable early detection, early treatment, and reduce the physical, emotional, and financial burden of obtaining a diagnosis for women suffering from these common yet disruptive symptoms.",Development of a biomarker panel for minimally-invasive screening and diagnosis of gynecological disease,10146682,R41HD104402,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Atypical Endometrial Hyperplasias', 'Autoantibodies', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dilatation and Curettage', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Endometrial Carcinoma', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Financial Hardship', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Gynecologist', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Hysteroscopy', 'Image', 'Infertility', 'Irrigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laparoscopy', 'Leiomyoma', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'New York', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preneoplastic Conditions', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Uterine Polyp', 'Uterine hemorrhage', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker panel', 'chronic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic panel', 'disabling symptom', 'disease diagnosis', 'endometriosis', 'experience', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'medical schools', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'translational research program', 'uterus endometriosis']",NICHD,"MDDX, INC.",R41,2020,299998,299998,-0.06265488775144233
"A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease Project Summary There is an obvious need for new approaches and better assays for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. All attempts to develop a practical assay for the direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi in infected patients have failed. Thus far, all proposed alternatives to serology have been unsuccessful, not cost-effective, or are still in early development. Improving serological detection in early disease is the fastest and most effective way to improve patient outcomes in Lyme disease. The antigen targets utilized in current serodiagnostic assays have considerable defects. They often contain conserved epitopes that cross-react with antibodies raised to other antigens, reducing specificity and requiring the use of a two-tier seroassay paradigm that preserves specificity at the cost of poor sensitivity in the detection of early disease. The use of peptides as serodiagnostic targets demonstrate improved efficacy, but the use of one or two peptides containing single epitopes still provides re- duced sensitivity in early disease. Putting the same old antigen targets into new platforms, no matter how in- novative the platform, will not succeed in improving serodiagnostics for Lyme disease. Both the target anti- gens and assays need an innovative approach. By incorporating unique peptides containing linear epitopes highly specific to B. burgdorferi, into a cutting-edge, multiplex, portable paper-based point-of-care diagnostic assay that uses a cost-effective smartphone-based reader, we aim to transform the diagnosis of Lyme disease. An ideal test for Lyme disease could be performed in a single step and yield an answer on the spot to support diagnosis and direct the course of clinical treatment. We have developed an innovative vertical-flow assay which allows for the multiplexed detection of IgM and IgG binding of up to 25 independent antigen targets in a point-of-care setting. The VFA design allows for uniform flow of sample across the target membrane, creating uniform binding conditions and maximizing developed signal. We coupled this design with a cost-effective portable smart-phone based reader allowing for quantitative measure of antibody binding, eliminating subjectiv- ity. By multiplexing peptide antigens each containing 1-2 epitopes unique to B. burgdorferi from multiple differ- ent antigens expressed at different stages during mammalian infection we can generate a single tier, POC as- say that can specifically and sensitively detect patient antibody at all stages of the disease. The assay can be completed in less than 25 min allowing for rapid in office results to support clinical diagnosis, thereby improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Early diagnosis of Lyme disease is critical to prevent disease progression and sequelae; however current laboratory diagnostics that are used to support clinical diagnosis are insensitive during early infection, failing ~50% of the time. We propose the development of a sensitive and specific multi-antigen point-of-care assay that will provide immediate serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, to aid in physician diagnosis. Accurate, rapid diagnosis will improve patient outcomes by reducing the likelihood of developing potentially debilitating late stage disease through early antibiotic intervention.",A peptide-based point-of-care vertical flow assay for the rapid diagnosis of Lyme disease,10080510,R44AI150060,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Bedside Testings', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Borrelia miyamotoi', 'Cells', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Coupled', 'DBL Oncoprotein', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epitopes', 'Family', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'ITGB3 gene', 'ImProv', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Diagnosis', 'Legal patent', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'OspC protein', 'Paper', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cross reactivity', 'decorin binding protein B', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'multiplex detection', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'portability', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'relapsing fever borrelia', 'screening']",NIAID,"BIOPEPTIDES, INC.",R44,2020,300000,599812,-0.009315786913024458
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9888409,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,319844,641965656,-0.04675073298732556
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9927686,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning method', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,340025,558628098,-0.02245897914948071
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,9944803,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,342100,511185245,-0.012276726153879189
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America.

"Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion Summary/Abstract - Quadrant Biosciences is developing a new diagnostic to aid in the clinical detection of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in school-aged children and young adults (13–22 years). Based on salivary microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, Quadrant’s diagnostic will provide an accurate, objective, and non-invasive method for mTBI diagnosis. Such a method is critically needed, as the number of pediatric mTBIs is on the rise, and the developing brains of young patients are more vulnerable to the after-effects of mechanical forces, leading to a wide range of negative effects on physical, cognitive, and psychological function. The diagnosis and assessment of mTBI in adolescents are challenging and rely on subjective measures, leading many mTBIs to go undiagnosed or underreported. This results in suboptimal post-injury treatment and patient management. A biologic assay to accurately diagnose adolescent mTBI would therefore provide an invaluable guide for clinical care, potentially guiding decisions for imaging, return to play, return to school, and therapeutic interventions. While a number of potential biomarkers for objectively detecting mTBI have been proposed, including the blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase (UCH-L1), recent research questions the ability of blood-based biomarkers to differentiate patients with mTBI from those with acute orthopedic trauma, particularly in pediatric populations. Moreover, these assays require venipuncture expertise that is not always available, particularly in the case of sports-related concussions, which account for nearly 1/3 of mTBIs in this patient population. To address these shortcomings, Quadrant Biosciences is creating a novel, objective diagnostic tool based on a panel of saliva miRNA biomarkers that are differentially expressed in patients with mTBI. Pilot studies in over 200 individuals with mTBI have identified a panel of saliva miRNAs capable of diagnosing mTBI and predicting symptom duration. In the proposed Fast Track project, Quadrant will advance development of this test by establishing a rapid, accurate method for quantifying these miRNAs and refining/validating a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate adolescents and young adults with mTBI from peers with symptomology that mimics mTBI (e.g. chronic headaches, anxiety/depression, ADHD, exercise-related fatigue, and orthopedic injury). In Phase I, Quadrant will refine a diagnostic algorithm for mTBI using a rapid quantification technique for saliva miRNAs. Machine learning will be used to develop a diagnostic algorithm that employs miRNA levels from the rapid multiplex assay alongside participant medical and demographic characteristics to predict mTBI status. In Phase II, Quadrant will validate the diagnostic algorithm for differentiating mTBI from medical conditions with overlapping symptomology in a prospective, case-control study of 2500 adolescents and young adults (age 13–22 years) to refine the saliva-based diagnostic aid for mTBI. Ultimately, Quadrant’s proposed salivary miRNA-based test will yield a minimally invasive, objective, biologic test that can aid diagnosis of mTBI, including among patients with confounding psychologic conditions. Narrative - Children and adolescents account for approximately 2/3 of the 3 million concussions that occur in the U.S. each year, placing them at risk for negative impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychological function, including poor academic performance, behavior, social interactions, and reduced subsequent employment. Unfortunately, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is underdiagnosed due to the poor sensitivity of conventional methods (neurological assessment, self-reporting, imaging, etc.) and lack of an objective, non-invasive diagnostic tool. Quadrant Biosciences’ rapid, accurate, objective aid for the diagnosis of mTBIs in adolescents and young adults will enable timely and accurate decision-making in mTBI assessment, resulting in reduced re- injury/morbidity, individualized patient management, and improved long-term patient outcomes.",Refinement of a rapid saliva miRNA diagnostic test for concussion,10081522,R42NS119119,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Headaches', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Emergency department visit', 'Employment', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Headache', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurologic', 'Olfactory Nerve', 'Oral cavity', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Sports', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Venipunctures', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'aging population', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical care', 'concussive symptom', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'differential expression', 'improved', 'mechanical force', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'minimally invasive', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'peer', 'personalized management', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase', 'young adult']",NINDS,"QUADRANT BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R42,2020,380848,933478,-0.008500716398730415
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,9995722,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,395738,533302350,0.0026575840854110274
"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,31777928,-0.007259236965799642
"Designing neutralization antibodies against Sars-Cov-2 Project Summary COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic whose rapid spread and mortality rate threatens millions of lives and the global economic system. Developing effective treatment such as neutralization antibodies is an urgent need. We propose here to develop a new method to design antibodies strongly bind to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that is necessary for viral entrance to human cells. We will develop a novel approach that combines directed evolution, deep sequencing and interpretable neural network models to efficiently identify strong and specific antibodies. This method will allow analyzing large sequencing data sets of antibody variants against the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in order to derive superior binders that do not exist in the original library. Iteration through directed evolution and computational design will efficiently identify neutralization antibody candidates that can be used as potent therapeutics to treat COVID-19.

"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,9882859,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,438331,148186688,-0.05532353546408226
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10088013,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2020,499995,499995,-0.07924527984185586
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9971509,R01DK109008,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Visceral fat', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R01,2020,514103,45734163,0.011986961974121222
"Translation of a biomarker panel for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma This application proposes to translate our identification of a biomarker panel for hepatocellular carcinoma to commercial and clinical use. We have identified a specific post-translation modification that is altered in HCC. This alteration is a shift in the composition of N-linked glycans found on proteins made in and secreted by HCC cells. Many of the proteins containing this glycan alteration have been identified and patented. Our strong preliminary evidence has shown that some of these proteins, when combined with existing biomarkers and clinical factors, have excellent discriminatory ability between those with HCC and those with cirrhosis. Importantly, our biomarker efforts have focused on the detection of early stage lesions using our current biomarker panel, which is a simple logistic regression algorithm composed of fucosylated kininogen, alpha- fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), age and gender. Called the kininogen panel, it had an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.97 for the differentiation of early stage HCC from cirrhosis. In an independent external validation of this panel, in three independent cohorts this panel had an AUROC of 0.92 to 0.97 in the detection of early stage HCC. Thus our enthusiasm for this biomarker panel is high. To fully understand the clinical and commercial benefits of any biomarker, a large scale clinical validation study that is appropriate powered is essential. Hence, the two goals of this application are to validate the kininogen panel for the detection of early stage HCC at the time of HCC diagnosis (Aim 1) and determine when in time an individual becomes biomarker positive prior to developing HCC (Aim 2). At the completion of these two aims, Glycotest will have validated this biomarker panel and have confidence in its performance. Glycotest's strategy is focused on commercialization of its tests as Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) service products. These tests will be marketed to and ordered by specialists who care for the patient populations at risk for liver cancers and fibrosis-cirrhosis. LDTs are tests developed and run in a single ""CLIA lab"" regulated by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The LDT business model has been used successfully by many other US companies that have commercialized tests as service products in multiple disease areas. The Company will establish an internal selling and marketing capability focused initially on major influential medical centers and key opinion leader sites as well as the west coast and east coast geographical areas, and will pursue a strategy for establishing Medicare reimbursement that it has developed in collaboration with external experts. Narrative: The goal of this proposal is to translate a biomarker for the early detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to clinical and commercial use. We have identified a method to dramatically improve the existing marker for the early detection HCC and will further develop and validate it in this study.",Translation of a biomarker panel for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma,10020367,R01CA237659,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Area', 'Aspartate Transaminase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Businesses', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Kininogens', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lesion by Stage', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Kininogen', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Services', 'Site', 'South Carolina', 'Specialist', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'case control', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'design', 'early detection biomarkers', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'liver function', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'testing services', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,518911,136810522,-0.016388958406043125
"AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinson’s Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 7 million people worldwide, and biomarkers to bolster the therapeutic pipeline are urgently needed. Developing biomarkers for clinical use is a difficult process that requires evaluation of multiple, large cohorts, each adding confidence to the marker. The Accelerating Medicine Partnership in Parkinson’s disease (AMP PD) consortium provides an unparalleled opportunity to rapidly achieve this previously elusive goal.  We hypothesize that a powerful, multi-omics classifier powered by standard and advanced machine learning algorithms will accurately identify PD-associated biomarkers at genome scale. Transcripts and genomic classifiers associated with PD will be identified in early-stage, untreated, patients with Dopamine Transporter- neuroimaging-supported diagnosis represented in the PPMI cohort. Transcripts and genomic classifiers will be rigorously replicated in the independent PDBP and BioFIND cohorts. Multi-omics classifiers using both PD- associated transcriptome changes and PD-associated genomic variants will be built with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. variational autoencoder).  This analysis will powerfully delineate --- for the first time --- the full spectrum of known and novel, coding and noncoding RNAs linked to PD and detectable in circulating blood cells in a harmonized, large-scale data set. It will develop and test highly innovative multi-omics classifiers and provide a generally useful computational framework for large-scale, unbiased PD biomarker discovery. Project Narrative These large-scale studies are relevant to public health for two reasons. First, they will reveal the biomarker genes whose dysregulation of expression level is associated with (and possibly causal of) early development of Parkinson’s disease. Secondly, the multi-omics, DNA-RNA predictive model built here based on large dataset and advanced deep learning methods will provide a computational framework for further biomarker development and early disease prediction.",AI2AMP-PD: Accelerating Parkinsons Diagnosis using Multi-omics and Artificial Intelligence,10157680,U01NS120637,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'DNA', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'dopamine transporter', 'feature selection', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'genomic signature', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,537000,327644200,0.012946175025151753
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10096452,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564483,550947887,-0.0010515283495067392
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions. Project Narrative  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and other related targets at an early stage in their development to enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.",Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index,10070930,R01NS113541,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angioplasty', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Distal', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'constriction', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'temporal measurement', 'vector']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,612984,607172798,-0.012049387600798626
"Multi-tissue high-throughput proteomic and genomic study in Parkinson's Disease Project Summary/Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide, with the prevalence projected to double in the next few decades. Despite the improvements in high-throughput genomics and proteomics that have significantly facilitated the advancement of biomarker discovery in other neurodegenerative diseases, there are no reliable biomarkers for PD. Currently, the PD diagnosis relies almost entirely on clinical examination. There are several reasons for the lack of reliable biomarkers in PD including most studies have been focused on single molecules in one tissue, small samples sizes and a lack of independent replication cohorts. To overcome these limitations, we propose leveraging a unique resource that includes quantitative proteomic analysis of ~1,300 proteins from CSF and plasma of clinically diagnosed PD patients coupled with validation in brain samples from autopsy-confirmed PD cases. We will pair the proteomic data with novel and powerful unbiased (hypothesis-free) genomic approaches to select the most plausible candidates for targeted replication studies. This large-scale screening of ~3,110 samples could identify biomarkers of known molecular pathways involving PD or with a clear genetic connection to PD risk. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify proteins differentially expressed in PD patients in plasma, CSF or brain tissue. We plan to carry out a quantitative proteomic analysis using Somalogic SOMAscan® assay of plasma (n=600) and CSF (n=200) from clinically diagnosed PD patients and of brain tissue (n=200) from autopsy-confirmed PD patients. We will also evaluate CSF (n=740), plasma (n=410) and brain tissue (n=114) from an independent cohort of healthy individuals and CSF (n=275), plasma (n=234) and brain tissue (n=345) from AD patients. We expect to obtain precise and accurate levels of a large number of proteins across multiple tissues in the analyzed samples. Specific Aim 2: To prioritize candidate biomarkers based on an integrative analysis of proteomic and genome-wide genotyping data using Mendelian Randomization (MR). We plan to integrate proteomic and GWAS data to identify protein quantitative loci (pQTLs) and apply MR approaches to determine proteins involved in the causal pathway of PD. Using this approach, we will be able to select reliable PD biomarker candidates for validation. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether genetic and proteomic data improves biomarker specificity. We will ascertain whether combining proteomic and genomic data could increase biomarker accuracy. We expect to uncover a genome-proteome network that may provide a basis for novel approaches to diagnostic and pharmacotherapeutic applications in PD. Narrative Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans. Currently, there are no reliable, sensitive and specific biomarkers identified in PD to date.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10132152,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,635916,415711940,0.005296755286050013
"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10034036,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2020,645818,191864802,-0.015081734939549889
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways The COVID-19 global pandemic has led to more than 470,000 deaths. This disease is especially perilous for the elderly - 80% of deaths in the US have been individuals over the age of 65, and the social isolation created by lockdowns have increased risks of serious physical and mental health issues.  COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease exhibiting a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild (e.g. loss of smell, dry cough) to critical (e.g. cytokine storm, renal failure, cardiovascular damage, respiratory failure, lethal blood clotting, neurological disorders). This clinical heterogeneity demands a precision medicine approach that elucidates distinct pathways underlying the disease, develops treatments for each pathway, and defines biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification within the subsets. A key benefit of precision medicine is that drugs may be repurposed or may already exist to treat specific subsets of infected individuals. For example, one critical outcome for COVID-19 infection is the onset of a cytokine storm, in which the body's immune system gets caught in a positive feedback loop, leading to shock and rapid failure of multiple organs. There are existing drugs for treating cytokine storm syndrome, but practitioners have no clear guidelines if such treatments are beneficial or destructive. If the individual is not in a hyperinflammatory state, the administration of these drugs could cripple their immune response, leading to increased viral load. Plasma biomarker patterns of proteins and metabolites hold potential to identify impending cytokine storms and other lethal outcomes.  To advance precision medicine for COVID-19 treatment, this work will generate large-scale omics data and evaluate levels of proteins and metabolites for plasma drawn from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 normal controls. These data will be immediately released to the research community. Our research team will take a concerted multipronged approach for analyzing these data using diverse complementary techniques. Our labs' research focuses on the discovery of combinations of genes and proteins expressing synchronously and the associations of these combinations with traits of interest, as well as endophenotype discovery. In addition to thorough single analyte analyses, this research will employ three computational strategies to reveal combinations of factors defining patterns: 1) network modeling, 2) explainable-AI systems biology, and 3) linear programming. These intensive analyses will require significant computational resources and we will utilize Summit at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, for these tasks.  The comprehensive protein and metabolite profiles, based on a large cohort of COVID-19 cases and normal controls, along with our rigorous interrogation of these data for complex biomarker patterns indicative of patient outcomes, hold unprecedented potential to drive solid advances in precision medicine and to reduce mortality rates due to COVID-19. In addition, this research will provide an agile model for use when tackling other heterogeneous diseases plaguing humankind, as well as novel viruses that may arise in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptionally detrimental for the elderly, as they comprise 80% of deaths in the US and are at elevated risks for serious physical and mental health issues due to social isolation. COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease that exhibits a range of diverse symptoms, demanding a precision medicine approach in which treatments for each distinct outcome are developed, biomarker patterns to diagnose patients for classification into an outcome group are defined, and new candidate drug targets are generated for each outcome. In order to lay the foundation for a precision medicine approach for treating COVID-19, this work will generate a highly-phenotyped large-scale omics dataset including blood proteomics and metabolomics from 350 COVID-19 positive cases and 750 uninfected healthy individuals and will intensely analyze these data using diverse complementary high-performance computing techniques, including network modeling with enhanced accuracy, explainable-AI systems biology incorporating diverse data, and pioneering linear programming producing optimal associations, thereby illuminating complex proteomic and metabolomic biomarker patterns associated with each critical disease outcome and generating novel candidate drug targets.",A Multipronged Interrogation of Large-Scale Omics Data to Reveal COVID-19 Pathways,10202278,RF1AG053303,"['2019-nCoV', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood coagulation', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ebola', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Programming', 'Mental Health', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Mutate', 'Natural Selections', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shock', 'Smell Perception', 'Social isolation', 'Solid', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toes', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'computing resources', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'fighting', 'human old age (65+)', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'physical conditioning', 'precision drugs', 'precision medicine', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor', 'response', 'statistics', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'trait', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,650002,533594881,-0.010107549595463602
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9928464,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,653362,415711940,-0.04918916308802969
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,136810522,0.00626276280333244
"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9849329,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2020,655091,65064605,-0.007764963444910338
"Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi Prashant K. Purohit, John L. Bassani, Valeri Barsegov and John W. Weisel The goal of this proposal is to explore and understand the fracture toughness of blood clots and thrombi, thus providing a mechanistic basis for life-threatening thrombotic embolization. A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales.

"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",10021656,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'postpartum outcome', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,662614,111231681,-0.0015786988167566015
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality. The study is very likely to have a high impact on identifying key environmental factors that can prevent or ameliorate COVID-19 progression.",The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality,10152911,R01ES029963,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Asthma', 'Body mass index', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Fatality Rates', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coronavirus', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Europe', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Hypertension', 'Immune', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'ambient air pollution', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'coarse particles', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data resource', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'fine particles', 'high risk', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel coronavirus', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'traffic-related air pollution']",NIEHS,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,670296,111231681,-0.03352681730425124
"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission.

"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9989043,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,677759,329565273,0.000954737406970648
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9938424,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,710049,758431960,-0.024067561467929325
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9852419,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'progression marker', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,711592,524978793,0.020457106782432222
"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,10006790,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'data streams', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,722295,641965656,0.02165448403592003
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,9998433,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2020,766675,6384662,-0.006203443498883122
"Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Rapid and accurate methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response do not currently exist. Efforts to improve outcomes have focused on early identification of rifampicin susceptibility followed by prompt treatment initiation and adherence monitoring. The rapid molecular susceptibility tests most often used give dichotomous cutoffs. Recent studies though show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) just below these breakpoints also predict poor outcomes. Even if a patient takes most of their therapy, clinical response can still vary substantially. Delays in sputum clearance (culture conversion from growth to no growth) can range from a few days to 5 months and failure or relapse rates can be as high as 20% in drug-susceptible TB. During the weeks to months of human infection and antibiotic treatment, in host Mtb populations experience substantial measurable genetic changes. These changes may be neutral or allow pathogen adaption to immune, antibiotic or metabolic pressure, e.g. low iron or cobalamin levels that may result in heritable drug tolerance and resistance phenotypes. Here we propose to study in host longitudinal pathogen dynamics including changes in population diversity over time and identify genes under selection to shed light on host-pathogen interactions. The study of in host pathogen dynamics can improve our understanding of cure from infection and pave the way for the use of whole genome sequencing for monitoring treatment response, circumventing the delays and biohazards of traditional culture-based approaches. We additionally propose the development of a genome- based predictor of MIC and to assess if MIC predictions are associated with delays in culture conversion and poor clinical response. We will systematically study pathogen samples from a well characterized TB treatment patient cohort (NIAID TRUST TB cohort in Worcester, South Africa -PI Dr. Jacobson) combining long and deep short-read sequencing to resolve full genome assemblies and variants at low allele frequency. We have strong preliminary data that long-read sequencing unmasks more Mtb genetic diversity than detectable by short-read sequencing alone and have previously characterized directional selection in a subset of genes including resistance loci, the B12 biosynthesis pathway, and PPE genes known to interact with host innate defense. The proposed work is enabled by our methodological expertise in population genetics, machine learning and resistance prediction for clonal bacteria like Mtb and will allow, for the first time, the study of directional and diversifying selection on the full repertoire of Mtb genetic variation. It will also allow the training of an MIC prediction model on a large ~17,000 isolate dataset curated across studies and geographies. Both study aims promise to inform our understanding of how pathogen genetic variation affects Mtb survival in host and the response to treatment. Project Narrative Patients with tuberculosis (TB) can benefit greatly if we could identify signs of poor response earlier and adjust therapy intensity accordingly. Innovations in DNA isolation and sequencing technologies now enable the study of TB pathogen populations in an individual patient with very high resolution. Here, we propose to use these technologies and a highly well-characterized cohort of South African TB patients to investigate how pathogen population genetic changes link to pathogen survival and treatment response, laying the foundation for improvements in clinical treatment monitoring using DNA sequencing.",Investigating bacterial contributions to TB treatment response: a focus on in-host pathogen dynamics,10100014,R01AI155765,"['Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Attenuated', 'Bacteria', 'Biohazardous Substance', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cobalamin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Drug resistance', 'ELF3 gene', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Iron', 'Isoniazid resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Minor', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Race', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Rifampin', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic variation', 'high risk', 'immunological status', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,781859,178569161,-0.01577303561162862
"A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) surpassed HIV as the number one cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of TB cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active TB cases in 2017. More than 80% of active TB disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LTBI. Yet, adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LTBI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LTBI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LTBI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LTBI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of TB cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LTBI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LTBI tests and reactivation TB. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LTBI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LTBI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LTBI care continuum. PROJECT NARRATIVE California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the contiguous U.S., of which 80% are due to reactivation. These TB cases can be prevented via screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), yet, current adoption of the latent TB screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. We will leverage expansive electronic health record data from two of the largest healthcare organizations in California to create and validate a new LTBI screening and treatment approach that can vastly improve identification and successful treatment of LTBI.",A New Approach to an Old Problem: Redesigning Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment,9943464,R01AI151072,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effectiveness measure', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'simulation', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment guidelines', 'wasting']",NIAID,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,800637,111231681,-0.022601196159160435
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,9998187,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,824479,292134808,-0.019913014070227844
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,10002324,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'complex data ', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'feature extraction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2020,869698,869698,-0.014053769229641914
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments. The proposed studies will bring together clinical, laboratory and statistical collaborators to address these knowledge gaps.",Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease,9974230,R01CA118953,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Allogenic', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complication', 'Consensus', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Disease Management', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Enrollment', 'Fibroblasts', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematological Disease', 'Homologous Transplantation', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lichen Planus', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory Disease', 'Reporting', 'Sampling', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Steroids', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systemic disease', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'chemokine', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'disorder subtype', 'early detection biomarkers', 'financial toxicity', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'survival prediction', 'therapeutic target', 'translational scientist', 'transplant survivor', 'treatment duration', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,885612,758431960,0.0021042777695243512
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9940863,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'data infrastructure', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'genetic testing', 'genomic locus', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2020,901625,901625,-0.025146779665888814
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,9851921,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,914660,148463823,-0.05773045799926863
"THE SEARCH FOR COVID-19 PREVENTION AND CURE: ADDRESSING THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNATE/ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY BY INTEGRATING NOVEL INFORMATICS, TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH Individual CTSA hubs are leading the national clinical and translational research efforts in developing new approaches to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This crucial role was natural. Long before the current crisis, CTSA hubs were committed to translation, building multidisciplinary teams of investigators and community partners, overcoming regulatory burdens, ensuring quality in clinical and human research, developing transformative informatics, and disruptive technologies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In this proposal, we build on our center’s active participation in meaningful clinical trials (e.g., the NIH Remdesivir RCT), the early creation of a biospecimen repository from COVID-19 patients, institutional commitment and fundraising that led to a $3.5 million pilot fund distribution, a robust and accessible clinical database repository, and the ongoing work of an NCATS-supported CTSA Collaboration Innovation Award (a coalition of the J. Craig Venter Institute, UCSD, UCI, and Stanford) focused on artificial intelligence approaches for the analysis of flow cytometry data. Using the emerging informatics framework of supervised generalized canonical correlation for integrative data analysis, we will link clinical data from COVID-19 patients enrolled in a variety of trials and at various stages of disease with innovative in vitro evaluation of innate and adaptive immunity, an area still poorly understood in SARS-CoV-2 pathology, obtained from patient biospecimens to obtain mechanistic insights of COVID-19 pathogenesis at a systems level. Innate and adaptive immunity are particularly relevant to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis because they play key, but distinct, roles at all phases of the illness (initial tissue-virus interaction; systemic responses; the cell-mediated cytokine storm leading to multi- organ failure and death, likely long after levels of viremia have fallen; and, ultimately, protective immunity). The current CCIA novel flow cytometry informatics research permits elucidation of dynamic cellular immune responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic that were heretofore unobservable. Using Hi-DAFi for mass cytometry analysis, validated informatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomics analysis, and cutting-edge statistical data integration and machine learning strategies tied back to the available clinical data we will be able to discover novel associations between cellular biomarkers and disease state, a particular therapy, and disease mediating factors such as age, health disparities, and the presence of other diseases or conditions like obesity. This information will aid in critical efforts to target new therapies and possibly identify idiosyncratic individual physiologic variables that render certain patients who seem to have no known comorbidities more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 disease. Finally, the robust connection between the UCI hub and both regional and national networks (e.g., BRAID, the coalition of the 5 UC CTSAs, and NCATS Trial Innovation Network) will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rapidly disseminate clinically relevant discoveries and engage the talent and insight of the many clinicians and scientists working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

"Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify Predictors of Cognitive Change in PD PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairment and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) are well-established disorders in Parkinson’s disease (PD) which are debilitating and contribute to increased mortality. The course, severity, and rate of progression of cognitive symptoms in PD is variable and unpredictable. Some patients develop PDD within the first several years of diagnosis, while others remain cognitively intact or have a milder form of impairment for many years after diagnosis. This heterogeneity in impairment profile and risk to PDD likely reflects the diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms associated with PD progression and cognitive dysfunction. The combination of diverse pathological features and clinical phenotypes makes it challenging to inform patients what to expect during the course of disease, and is a substantial barrier to developing new drugs for cognitive impairment in PD. Therefore, developing prognostic markers of risk of cognitive progression in PD is important. Our overall hypothesis is that different combinations of biomarkers will be more informative in predicting cognitive progression compared to a single biomarker alone. Thus, our objective is to investigate multivariable data to identify unique clinical-molecular-imaging biomarker signatures that identify individuals with PD who are most likely to experience substantial cognitive changes that ultimately lead to PDD. To achieve our objective, we will first develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of incident mild cognitive impairment in people with early-stage PD (aim 1). Next, we will develop deep learning models that identify multivariable features that are prognostic of either (a) conversion from mild cognitive impairment to PDD (aim 2); or, (b) reversion from mild cognitive impairment to cognitively intact PD (aim 3). Finally, we will develop deep learning models that identify prognostic markers of rapid cognitive deterioration in PD leading to PDD (aim 4). For the development of the proposed models, this project will take advantage of a large repository of clinical data available at the Center for Health + Technology (CHeT) at the University of Rochester. The modeling will be carried out at the University of Rochester Data Science Consortium (RDSC) by an experienced team of data scientists that will use multimodal temporal convolution network models. A multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, pharmacologists, and data scientists will support model execution and the interpretation of the modeling results. The expected outcomes of the efforts from this research are comprehensive multivariable prognostic markers of cognitive progression in PD across different stages of disease, from mild impairment to PDD that will add novel insight into disease process. NARRATIVE Deep learning will be used to construct models of cognitive progression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) from multiple data modalities. The models will assess and evaluate the potential impact of clinical, biosamples, genetics, and imaging variables on the progression to mild cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as on rates of cognitive progression. These models will identify markers and their combinations that are prognostic to distinct cognitive progression trajectories in PD.",Comprehensive Multivariable Deep Learning Models to Identify Predictors of Cognitive Change in PD,10052031,RF1NS115141,"['Address', 'Age', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'advanced analytics', 'care costs', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive disability', 'cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos', 's', 'convolutional neural network', 'data warehouse', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'motor disorder', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'progression marker', 'sex']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,RF1,2020,1155000,179705973,-0.014850000087303738
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants.

"Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings PROJECT SUMMARY There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins, and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP) accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis, we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well- characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra- sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT- 6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut- offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB. PROJECT NARRATIVE The inability to quickly and accurately diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in children and initiate treatment is a major contributor to the high mortality of childhood TB worldwide. This study will identify novel Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers, and determine the best biomarker panels (i.e., biosignatures) that can meet the World Health Organization-recommended diagnostic accuracy thresholds for a TB triage or diagnostic test. If successful, the results will the first step needed to make progress toward addressing the critical unmet need for non-sputum biomarker-based tests for childhood TB.",Childhood ‘Omics’ and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-derived BiOsignatures (COMBO) for TB diagnosis in high HIV prevalence settings,9986338,R01AI152161,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gambia', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV/TB', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'Immunoassay', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Tryptophan', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'biosignature', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'field study', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'ion mobility', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptomics', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'validation studies']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,1503586,685608202,-0.018898353156348725
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9934148,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,2195573,415711940,0.010461415984761736
"DIGITAL HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR COVID-19: PERSONALIZED ANALYTICS WEARABLE BIOSENSOR PLATFORM FOR EARLY DETECTION OF COVID-19 DECOMPENSATION The goal of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence-based data analytics and cloud computing platform, paired with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared wearable devices, to create a personalized baseline index that could indicate a change in health status for patients who have tested COVID-19 positive.  The project involves the development and validation of a COVID-19 Decompensation Index (CDI) that builds off physIQ’s existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics platform.  Data will be collected from 400 human subjects that are both pre-hospitalization subjects (found to be positive for COVID-19) and subjects that have been hospitalized and treated for COVID and then discharged.  This combined population will consist of COVID-19 decompensation cases (event cases) and cases for which COVID-19 did not result in any kind of decompensation (non-event cases).  The 400-patient dataset will be partitioned into a training subset and a testing subset.

"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9843974,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2020,2648396,415711940,0.005296755286050013
"Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics Project Summary  Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most lethal hematologic malignancy in childhood, with a probability of 5-year survival at only 60%. Most children diagnosed with AML initially respond well to standard chemotherapy; however, nearly 40% eventually develop relapsed disease, which responds poorly to treatment and is fatal in the majority of patients. Although age at diagnosis, response to induction chemotherapy, and cytogenetic status have been identified as coarse prognostic factors in pediatric AML, it is still unclear what molecular features lead certain patients to relapse over others. Thus, developing an enhanced understanding of the mechanistic drivers underlying relapse in pediatric AML represents a significant area of clinical need.  Many reports indicate that there are rare, hematopoietic stem cell-like subpopulations in AML patients that resist chemotherapy and drive relapse. However, the exact characteristics of these relapse-associated cells—often called “leukemic stem cells” (LSCs)—are a matter of contention, with reported phenotypes spanning much of the known hematopoietic developmental continuum and differing significantly between patients and throughout the course of disease. As such, the identity and importance of these relapse-associated cells as well as their relationship to normal hematopoietic developmental processes remain mysterious.  The proposed project will examine the relationship between single-cell AML phenotypes, clinical outcomes, and normal myeloid development in 60 clinically-annotated primary samples from pediatric AML patients in order to identify relapse-associated cellular subtypes. To achieve this, we will leverage the versatility of mass cytometry, a 40-parameter single-cell proteomics platform, and machine learning in simultaneously studying the complex surface and signaling phenotypes of millions of leukemic cells from patients’ diagnostic and relapse bone marrow samples relative to healthy controls. Central hypothesis: We hypothesize that high-dimensional molecular profiling of primary AML cells will reveal consistent, functional phenotypes associated with relapse-driving subpopulations that computationally align with particular stages of healthy hematopoietic development and represent points of future therapeutic intervention. Aim 1: Develop methods to computationally align high-dimensional, single-cell AML phenotypes with their  most analogous developmental state along the healthy myeloid continuum. Aim 2: Utilize predictive modeling to determine the surface, signaling, and functional phenotype of AML  subpopulations predicting relapse and functionally validate these characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Project Narrative: For reasons that remain poorly understood, nearly 40% of the roughly 500 children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) each year in the United States will experience relapse after initially responding to treatment. To better characterize why some AML patients relapse while others do not, the proposed project will use state-of-the-art molecular profiling approaches to characterize millions of primary AML cells and their computational “alignment” with healthy hematopoietic development. These data will be used to construct a method of predicting at diagnosis which patients have a high risk of relapse in order to identify prognostically important cell populations that represent future therapeutic targets in the management of pediatric AML.",Predicting Post-treatment Relapse in Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Single-cell Proteomics,9758774,F31CA239365,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cox Models', 'Cytogenetics', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Event', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'molecular subtypes', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'stem-like cell', 'therapeutic target']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38650,560644462,-0.022672216498453437
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9730653,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2019,75097,193405667,0.004623720919143887
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,161094826,-0.026769900888881478
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will examine the transcriptome of urinary extracellular vesicles obtained non-invasively as a source of placenta-derived nucleic acids reflective of the development of preeclampsia (PE), and will con- duct in vitro experiments to determine the role of placental extracellular vesicles in renal dysfunction in PE.",Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia,9974957,K99HD096125,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Ductal Epithelial Cell', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Excretory function', 'Failure', 'Fetal Mortality Statistics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypoxia', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Nephrons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Organ', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phase', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'maternal serum', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pregnancy disorder', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'stillbirth', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'uptake', 'urinary']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2019,104534,524978793,0.00611217423346292
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9663961,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,127308,415711940,0.006361805284375505
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,9776969,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Expression Profiling', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,149824,499995,-0.07924527984185586
"Understanding Inflammatory Arthritis due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Project Summary/Abstract The major goals of this proposal are to attain skills required to be an independent clinical and translational researcher in rheumatology and to enhance understanding of a new rheumatic disease, inflammatory arthritis (IA) due to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). ICIs are revolutionizing cancer treatment but also cause immune related adverse events. ICI-induced IA is the immune related adverse event most likely to be encountered by rheumatologists. ICI-induced IA causes significant morbidity, is clinically heterogeneous, and can persist after ICI cessation. The proposed project will utilize a group of well characterized patients with ICI- induced IA and ICI-treated control patients who do not develop IA to address several important questions. First, the clinical heterogeneity within ICI-induced IA will be evaluated and factors that predict persistence of IA beyond cessation of ICI therapy will be established. Next, clinical and immunogenetic risk factors for developing ICI-induced IA will be determined. Finally, serum cytokine profiles and autoantibodies before and after ICI treatment will be compared in patients with ICI-induced IA and control patients who are treated with ICIs and do not develop IA. These experiments will address key knowledge gaps for this emerging clinical entity. Specifically, defining relevant clinical subgroups will allow for differential monitoring and treatment of patients. Understanding risk factors for development of IA will allow for risk stratification of patients prior to therapy. Cytokines that are elevated in ICI-induced IA patient sera could serve as future therapeutic targets. Finally, understanding presence of autoantibodies and when they develop in the course of ICI treatment will give insight into pathogenesis and identify potential biomarkers. Concurrently with conducting research during the proposal, the candidate will participate in a variety of career development activities taking advantage of the rich resources of Johns Hopkins in the Division of Rheumatology, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. The candidate will participate in didactic coursework, conferences, and mentoring meetings with a diverse group of mentors from rheumatology, oncology, laboratory science, and data science. At the end of this award, the candidate will be an independent clinical investigator in the area of cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune disease and will establish a multi- center consortium with standardized data and biospecimen collection for rheumatic irAEs and for patients with preexisting autoimmune disease who are treated with ICIs.

"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail. Successful completion of this project has the potential to identify new markers of disease and novel targets for treatment.",Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection,9721353,K08DK120953,"['Advisory Committees', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Arteritis', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Complex', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FYN gene', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hour', 'Human', 'IGFBP3 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin-Secreting Cells', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'TNFRSF17 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'base', 'belimumab', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'kidney biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'random forest', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,165758,533594881,-0.02504904825575909
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9668180,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,166104,570146095,-0.01815027303030487
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,9645854,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2019,169440,593605914,-0.004148661055060047
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9938893,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2019,169483,329565273,-0.022729093092214218
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,673201228,0.007843286900440284
"Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract  There were an estimated 10.4 million tuberculosis (TB) cases, and 170,000 TB pediatric deaths in 2015, with >95% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Rapid diagnosis is essential for improved TB outcomes, but diagnosis is more difficult in children, since children are less likely to exhibit typical TB symptoms and have paucibacillary (few bacteria) TB cases that are more difficult to detect by current methods, while parents are often resistant to stressful TB sample collection procedures. We therefore propose to explore a novel rapid, accurate, low-cost and easy-to-use mobile phone-based blood test for pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. Our novel detection method rapidly quantifies circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from host cells infected with the TB pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our preliminary data indicate that we can rapidly quantitate EVs carrying Mtb biomarkers, such as lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, in pediatric TB patient blood samples using a mobile-phone-based dark-field microscope (MDFM) platform. These findings support our long-term goal to develop a low-cost system to improve pediatric TB diagnosis in LMIC settings. We also anticipate that this system will allow rapid treatment monitoring to improve therapy and reduce exposure of pediatric patients to toxic anti-TB drugs. To achieve these outcomes we propose to pursue three goals.  We collected our preliminary data with a MDFM that imaged transmitted light, but plan to design, develop, and validate the Aim 1 compact MDFM with a reflected light path to decrease the size of the device, simplify imagery, and increase the physical stability of the system. We will also develop a user-friendly application for image capture and data analysis on this platform. These features should markedly increase its feasibility for use in LMIC settings. Aim 2 will optimize assay performance for LMIC settings by redesigning assay materials for long-term storage under ambient conditions, and by determining optimal incubation times for different LMIC ambient temperature ranges. Aim 3 will analyze candidate Mtb-EV markers, including lipoarabinomannan and LpqH, build and a diagnostic model based on a multiple logistic regression algorithm, and validate diagnostic thresholds in separate validation cohort of pediatric TB patients and healthy controls with traceable clinical information. It will also compare the diagnostic performance of this multi-marker Mtb-EV assay to traditional diagnostic methods to evaluate its relative diagnostic performance.  Our approach offers several innovative features valuable for pediatric TB control. It quantifies stable TB biomarkers on EVs in serum (1µL), rather than detecting Mtb in difficult to obtain, variable, non-quantitative and infectious biopsies. It employs a novel, compact MDFM and a nanoparticle-based end-point assay that is stable at ambient conditions. Finally, the ability of this approach to quantitate Mtb-EVs should allow rapid evaluation of disease severity for real-time monitoring of treatment efficacy and cures to minimize toxic drug exposure times. Project Narrative There is an urgent need for novel approaches for rapid diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases to improve patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, which may lack resources and trained personnel. This proposal will develop a mobile phone-based device and a rapid tuberculosis assay that detects circulating extracellular vesicles secreted by infected cells in blood, both of which will be inexpensive and user-friendly to allow easy use by individuals with minimal training in resource-limited areas. This low-risk, high-reward approach is fundamentally different from traditional diagnostic methods, and it offers several advantages for diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis cases, including the use of serum rather than sputum or other biopsies that can be difficult to obtain in young children.",Mobile based Nanoplasmonic Quantification of Mtb-derived Exosomes in Serum for Pediatric TB diagnosis,9773333,R21EB026347,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Car Phone', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Dark-Field Microscope', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'End Point Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Housing', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Slide', 'Sputum', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'high reward', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lens', 'lipoarabinomannan', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microscopic imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pediatric patients', 'portability', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'rapid technique', 'real time monitoring', 'regression algorithm', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transmission process', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis diagnostics', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R21,2019,186679,92601146,0.008529331543363385
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9744005,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2019,189432,19926766,-0.0005389180644661254
"Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide. Despite recent scientific advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for control and eradication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. PLWH with latent TB infection (LTBI) have a ~10% annual risk of progressing to TB disease, however currently available tests for LTBI diagnosis have reduced sensitivity in this population and are not able to predict which latently infected individuals are at highest risk for developing TB for targeted preventive therapy. Emerging data from clinically relevant animal models suggest that LTBI and active TB represent a spectrum of immune responses and host pathology, with increasing metabolic changes and immune dysregulation during the transition to TB disease. We have identified unique serum metabolite and microRNA (miRNA) profiles that are able to discriminate between patients with TB and those with non-TB lung disease. However, these novel TB signatures have not been assessed prospectively to identify PLWH and HIV-negative persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for TB progression. In order to address this significant knowledge gap, in Aim 1 of the current research program, trainees will leverage the Indian and South African RePORT longitudinal biorepositories of household contacts of TB index cases to test the hypothesis that TB is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with profound changes in immune regulation and metabolism prior to the onset of clinical signs and symptoms. Another major barrier to global TB eradication efforts is the lengthy and complicated current anti-tubercular regimen, which is associated with medical nonadherence and the emergence of drug resistance. Recently, attention has focused on host-directed adjunctive therapies aimed at optimizing immune responses to the pathogen and improving lung damage. Lipid-laden macrophages (foam cells) are central to maintaining chronic TB infection by providing a favorable niche in which antimicrobial functions are down-regulated, and by inducing caseation and tissue damage. Recent work has shown that foam-cell-rich and necrotic areas of TB granulomas are particularly enriched in triglycerides. Mtb infection is associated with dysregulation of two cellular pathways involved in triglyceride homeostasis: a pro-lipogenic pathway involving protein kinase B and mTOR complex 1 (Akt/mTORC1), and an anti- lipogenic pathway involving AMP-activated protein kinase and the sirtuins (AMPK/SIRT). In Aim 2, trainees will use longitudinal clinical samples from RePORT study participants and experimental infections ex vivo to characterize: (i) the relationship between activation of these pathways and control of clinical Mtb infection, and the effect of anti-lipogenic treatments on antimycobacterial functions of human macrophages infected ex vivo. The research aims will be integrated with a mentoring strategy for mentees that fosters development of high impact patient-oriented research with a pathway to independence. Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the most deadly infections worldwide, especially among people living with HIV. Current available tests are not able to accurately detect persons at the highest risk of developing TB, and curing the disease requires at least 6 months of therapy because the TB bacteria can avoid being killed by the immune system and currently available drugs. In the current proposal, physician scientists will receive training in a variety of complementary disciplines, and use several cutting-edge experimental and modeling techniques to analyze samples from patients with TB and TB/HIV, with the ultimate goal of identifying new biomarkers that can predict TB disease and host-directed therapies that can shorten TB treatment.",Mentoring in Immunometabolic Dysregulation in TB and TB/HIV,9846869,K24AI143447,"['5&apos', '-AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimycobacterial Agents', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Foam Cells', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV/TB', 'Homeostasis', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Lipid-Laden Macrophage', 'Lipids', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sirtuins', 'South African', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antimicrobial', 'biobank', 'biosignature', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'high risk', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'lifetime risk', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tuberculosis granuloma', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K24,2019,191195,807432003,-0.02786856125091101
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9608712,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intrauterine infection', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,338121506,-0.014838261964467822
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9786824,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,192564,507546965,0.0041070163449094905
"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,209000,673201228,0.017203016216781695
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us.

"Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections Abstract COMBiNATi will work with Stanford University to bring the world’s first integrated ID+AST UTI diagnostic platform to the market by combining COMBiNATi’s “one-click” cost-effective dPCR platform with Stanford’s pathogen identification (ID) HRMA algorithm for broad detection, deep characterization and absolute quantification of UTI pathogens. By the end of the Phase 1 project, we will deliver the prototype instrument for ID and AST, scale-ready consumables for dPCR + HRM and culture + qPCR, machine-learning software algorithm for melt curve analysis, and prove the feasibility by identifying and quantifying the top two urinary tract infection bacteria. We will first develop two consumables: an 100k partition ID chip and a 32-lane, 10k partition per lane AST plate based on the micro-injection molding design rules established by COMBiNATi. An integrated system with thermal control and imaging capability will then be developed for HRM and qPCR processes. The prototype system will then be transferred to Stanford University where mock samples including both isolated bacteria and contrived urine samples will be tested on the platform for integrated pathogen ID and AST determination. Narrative Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is one of the most common community-acquired bacterial infection. However, like other bacterial infections, standard culture-based diagnosis of UTI requires at least 2-3 days from sample acquisition to result reporting. Despite technological advancements, the process remains time- consuming and requires significant technical expertise. Automated instruments remain bulky and still require clonal isolation of the pathogens from the body fluid samples prior to AST. Additionally, the lack of definitive microbiological diagnosis that is rapid enough to achieve evidence-based treatment has driven the over- and misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We believe the proposed integrated ID + AST platform has the potential to enable deep genetic analyses of clinical samples to provide rapid precision UTI triage and MIC determination in a timely and cost-efficient manner to positively impact patient care as well as promote the use of narrow spectrum antibiotics to favorably impact antibiotic resistance profiles.",Integrated Microbial Screening and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infections,9777415,R41AI145604,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Ampicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Fluids', 'Ceftriaxone', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Ciprofloxacin', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Genomic DNA', 'Gentamicins', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Molecular', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole', 'Universities', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urine', 'Uropathogen', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'digital', 'genetic analysis', 'imaging capabilities', 'instrument', 'melting', 'microbial', 'operation', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'success']",NIAID,"COMBINATI, INC.",R41,2019,224658,599695,-0.012481375977062038
"Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disabling condition for 2.5 million Americans associated with  prolonged fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and sleep disturbances. The cause of CFS remains  unknown, and there are currently no available diagnostic tests to confirm disease. However, a  substantial number of immune features have been measured in CFS. Given this problem, the objective  of this project is to identify a panel of distinct antibody epitopes that can be used to identify  cases of CFS using a blood test. In Aim 1, we will apply serum epitope repertoire analysis to  determine the antibody epitope repertoires within a cohort of 200 CFS patients and 175  controls. Antibody epitopes occurring in CFS sera, and not controls will be identified   using bioinformatics methods. A panel of motifs will be downselected using machine  learning to optimize sensitivity and specificity within the discovery set. The performance of  the panel will be measured in an independent set of specimens to determine sensitivity and  specificity, and identify potential CFS subgroups. We will determine whether individual  markers, or sets of markers, correlate with various clinical features of CFS. Infections with a variety of pathogens have been associated with the development of fatigue lasting  one year or longer, and post-infection fatigue patients typically meet clinical criteria for CFS.  Given the potential for heterogeneous infectious etiology, we hypothesize that CFS patients may  exhibit increased rates of seropositivity for a broad set of infectious agents associated with  fatigue. Using serum epitope repertoire analysis, we will determine whether IgG seropositivity for  20 infections (as a group) differs between CFS patients and controls. The proposed project may  identify antibody biomarkers suitable for development of diagnostic immunoassay for CFS, and may  elucidate whether prior or ongoing infections are associated with CFS. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalitis (ME), is a disabling condition  affecting an estimated 2.5 million people in the United States. The cause of CFS  remains unknown, and there are no objective laboratory diagnostic tests to  confirm disease. Consequently, diagnosis of CFS remains exceptionally difficult, requiring the  exclusion of a wide variety fatiguing illnesses. This project aims to apply advanced molecular  discovery tools and computation to identify patterns of circulating antibodies that can be   used to diagnose and monitor CFS patients using a blood test. This project also holds the  potential to associate prior infections with the development of CFS.",Serum antibody biomarkers of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome,9778480,R43AI145696,"['Academy', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Caregivers', 'Cell physiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cholinergic Receptors', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coxiella', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Encephalitis', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Exertion', 'Exhibits', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Fever Chills', 'Gene Expression', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Mononucleosis', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscarinics', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nuclear Antigens', 'Organism', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Seroprevalences', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Sore Throat', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'United States', 'acute infection', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'flu', 'immune activation', 'interest', 'lymph nodes', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'seropositive', 'sleep abnormalities', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAID,"SERIMMUNE, INC.",R43,2019,224975,0,0.007496114279503443
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications. This study will address major knowledge gaps of the intestinal microenvironment in preterm infants, and ultimately lead to improved strategies to manage neonatal gastrointestinal health, improve children’s health and quality of life, all which are within the mission of NIDDK.",Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants,9872417,R21DK123674,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acetyl Coenzyme A', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Butyrates', 'Child Health', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emergency Situation', 'Epithelial', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Milk', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lactulose', 'Lead', 'Leaky Gut', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Urine', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'early screening', 'feeding', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mucosal microbiota', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'screening', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'sugar', 'supervised learning', 'therapy design']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231750,230060143,-0.0011476023635718408
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9646340,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2019,249000,29585825,0.0003814577316817956

"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,0,-0.004383991081288523
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9640679,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,322937,641965656,-0.04675073298732556
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9702876,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,328340,641965656,0.0016257394267105893
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these challenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymorphisms, whole brain neuroimaging, biofluids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mechanisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Specifically, in Aim 1, we develop efficient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation models to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efficiency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-specific substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic systems through ordinary differential equations with random inflections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker profiles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efficient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individualized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest benefit from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9694287,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,340259,558628098,-0.02245897914948071
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9606448,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,342009,533594881,-0.00943684888527907
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9951760,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,366168,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9606513,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2019,422761,7208224,0.02965688374186027
"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9807074,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2019,482291,651293,-0.021850628063989675
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9640388,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2019,496653,499995,-0.005521723747476093
"Translation of a biomarker panel for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma This application proposes to translate our identification of a biomarker panel for hepatocellular carcinoma to commercial and clinical use. We have identified a specific post-translation modification that is altered in HCC. This alteration is a shift in the composition of N-linked glycans found on proteins made in and secreted by HCC cells. Many of the proteins containing this glycan alteration have been identified and patented. Our strong preliminary evidence has shown that some of these proteins, when combined with existing biomarkers and clinical factors, have excellent discriminatory ability between those with HCC and those with cirrhosis. Importantly, our biomarker efforts have focused on the detection of early stage lesions using our current biomarker panel, which is a simple logistic regression algorithm composed of fucosylated kininogen, alpha- fetoprotein (AFP), alkaline phosphatase (ALK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), age and gender. Called the kininogen panel, it had an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.97 for the differentiation of early stage HCC from cirrhosis. In an independent external validation of this panel, in three independent cohorts this panel had an AUROC of 0.92 to 0.97 in the detection of early stage HCC. Thus our enthusiasm for this biomarker panel is high. To fully understand the clinical and commercial benefits of any biomarker, a large scale clinical validation study that is appropriate powered is essential. Hence, the two goals of this application are to validate the kininogen panel for the detection of early stage HCC at the time of HCC diagnosis (Aim 1) and determine when in time an individual becomes biomarker positive prior to developing HCC (Aim 2). At the completion of these two aims, Glycotest will have validated this biomarker panel and have confidence in its performance. Glycotest's strategy is focused on commercialization of its tests as Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) service products. These tests will be marketed to and ordered by specialists who care for the patient populations at risk for liver cancers and fibrosis-cirrhosis. LDTs are tests developed and run in a single ""CLIA lab"" regulated by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The LDT business model has been used successfully by many other US companies that have commercialized tests as service products in multiple disease areas. The Company will establish an internal selling and marketing capability focused initially on major influential medical centers and key opinion leader sites as well as the west coast and east coast geographical areas, and will pursue a strategy for establishing Medicare reimbursement that it has developed in collaboration with external experts. Narrative: The goal of this proposal is to translate a biomarker for the early detection of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to clinical and commercial use.

"Targeting Senescence for Biomarkers and Therapeutics Type 1 Diabetes is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells. While there has been significant progress in understanding immune-mediated beta cell destruction, the role of beta cell dysfunction in the underlying etiology of T1D is less clear. We have discovered that pancreatic beta cells acquire a proinflammatory secretome reminiscent of SASP during T1D in mice and human. SASP beta cells can remodel the islet environment in a paracrine manner by promoting bystander senescence and immune surveillance. We have developed drugs that selectively eliminated SASP beta cells without altering the abundance of the major immune cell types involved in the disease. Significantly, elimination of SASP beta cells halted progression of beta cell destruction and was sufficient to prevent diabetes. In this proposal, we focus on human beta cells and characterize the non-cell autonomous effects of SASP on islet microenvironment and develop drugs that can selectively target human SASP beta cells. We utilize the secretory properties of SASP beta cells to identify biomarkers that can report on the efficacy of drug treatment and progression of the disease. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that beta cells acquire a proinflammatory secretome reminiscent of SASP during T1D and selective clearing of these cells prevented diabetes. In this proposal, we characterize the non-cell autonomous effects of senescent human beta cells on the islet microenvironment and develop senolytic compounds that can selectively target human SASP beta cells. We propose to identify biomarkers for assessing the efficacy of senolytic treatment and progression of the disease to pioneer new therapeutic approaches for T1D.",Targeting Senescence for Biomarkers and Therapeutics,9798318,R01DK121794,"['Address', 'Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'BCL2 gene', 'Basement membrane', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular Stress Response', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family', 'Ferritin', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred NOD Mice', 'Infiltration', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural History', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Structure of beta Cell of islet', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'islet', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'migration', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'paracrine', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'repository', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'senescence', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,550024,685608202,-0.026644820719453996
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by an infectious pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) in susceptible individuals, but we cannot yet classify or predict outcomes in those prone to pulmonary TB disease versus those prone to resistance. In part, this reflects knowledge gaps regarding genotypes that may increase susceptibility, and in validated disease correlates (e.g. serum of lung protein biomarkers) measured individually, or combined signatures. We address these knowledge gaps by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a population with abundant genetic diversity and heterozygosity, like the human population. Also, like humans, a low dose M.tb infection of DO mice produces a spectrum of outcomes, from highly susceptible to highly resistant, and many intermediate outcomes. In this proposal, we use the DO population to: 1) Identify and test the capacity of genotypic (alleles and statistically significant loci) to predict outcomes such as diagnostic category (class); and 2) To identify and test lung and serum biomarker (protein) and granuloma signatures to determine diagnostic category (class); and 3) To identify and test serum biomarker (protein) signatures that can forecast disease onset, within a 3-week window before illness manifests clinically. The best performing signatures will be tested using samples from humans. Collectively, results from these studies will generate new translatable knowledge regarding correlates of pulmonary TB (useful for diagnostics), and genotypic and serum protein signatures (useful for prognostics). PROJECT NARRATIVE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB) in millions of susceptible humans each year. It is well known that humans respond variably to M.tb infection, yet we are unable to predict outcomes with accuracy. Here, we use the Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse population to identify and test genotypic, serum, and lung biomarker signatures to accurately predict outcomes. Findings are also validated in samples from humans.",Predicting tuberculosis outcomes using genotypic and biomarker signatures,9642291,R01HL145411,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bacillus (bacterium)', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Granuloma', 'Harvest', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inbred Strain', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Malaria', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Necrosis', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vehicle crash', 'base', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'survival outcome', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2019,617451,65064605,-0.007764963444910338
"An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis Project Summary  Improved methods for the bedside diagnosis and evaluation of neuromuscular disorders are needed. One technology that is finding increasing use for this purpose is electrical impedance myography (EIM). In EIM, a very weak, high frequency electrical current is passed through a muscle of interest and the resulting surface voltages are measured. Disease associated alterations in the composition and microstructural features of the muscle produce characteristic changes that can be used to help classify specific conditions and grade disease severity. To date, most studies using EIM analysis have utilized a fairly limited data set for disease assessment. While effective, this approach ignores a great deal of information locked within the impedance data, including those values that can assist in predicting specific muscle features (such as myofiber diameter) and the presence of pathological change (e.g., fat or connective tissue deposition). In addition, as it stands, the data set is challenging for the clinician to understand without a detailed knowledge of impedance theory. Myolex, Inc is a small business concern located in Boston, MA has as its main focus the development of EIM technologies for clinical use. Myolex recently completed a Phase 1 SBIR that demonstrated the potential capability of machine learning based classification algorithms to effectively discriminate healthy muscle from diseased and to discriminate one disease from another. In this proposed work, we will greatly advance this concept by embodying classification algorithms into a powerful new software suite for Myolex’s current EIM system, the mView. Our underlying hypothesis is that EIM data analysis can be automated to the point that classification systems can provide data on disease diagnosis as well as disease severity for improved ease-of-use. We propose to study this hypothesis via 2 specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will design a software suite capable of assisting with artifact-free data collection to be incorporated into our current EIM system, the mViewTM. Then using classification paradigms based on a prodigious amount of previous collected data, we will develop an automated data analysis tool to help provide data on disease category as well as microscopic features, muscle based on the impedance data alone using Microsoft’s Azure Cloud platform. In Specific Aim 2, we will test this developed software suite in a total of180 adult and pediatric neuromuscular disease patients and healthy participants evaluated at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (adults) and Boston Children’s Hospital (children). During this data collection period, the Ohio State and Boston Children’s researchers will have real- time access to Myolex staff to provide feedback and have questions/problems answered and addressed. The user interface will continue to be refined and classification algorithms improved. At the conclusion of this work, a new diagnostic tool will be developed for potential 510(k) FDA approval. It will serve as the basis for a continuously self-refining system as additional data sets are collected by end-users employing them in regular clinical use. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a valuable technique to assist with the evaluation of a variety of conditions affecting nerve and muscle. However, to date, only simplistic EIM outcomes have been utilized to assess muscle condition. In this proposed work, we will develop a software platform using machine learning to be incorporated into current EIM technology to allow for automated diseased classification and characterization using the entire large EIM data set collected with each muscle measurement. This will serve as the basis for a new, powerful and convenient tool for neuromuscular diagnosis that will continue to advance over time.",An integrated electrical impedance myography platform for neuromuscular disease classification and diagnosis,9846955,R44NS113756,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Area', 'Back Pain', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Technology', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Myography', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Nerve', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neuromuscular conditions', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Radiculopathy', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercialization', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'electric impedance', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'nerve injury', 'neuromuscular', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric patients', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'sarcopenia', 'software development', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'voltage']",NINDS,"MYOLEX, INC.",R44,2019,621318,869698,-0.014053769229641914
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9743884,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,623653,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,758431960,-0.024067561467929325
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,136810522,0.00626276280333244
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,9765987,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,646285,415711940,-0.04918916308802969
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9701262,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Uterus', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'multidimensional data', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2019,650539,28472699,0.004152072681071871
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.",Shape up!

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,91477866,-0.03348734545290524
"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9654700,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferons', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,715056,524978793,0.020457106782432222
"Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Title: Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy ABSTRACT Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, multifactorial, autoimmune disorder that affects ~1% of the worldwide population (~2 million adults in the US alone). It is characterized by chronic synovitis that, when left untreated, can result in irreversible joint destruction and deformity, leading to increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. The last three decades have witnessed impressive advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic outcomes. In fact, the use of methotrexate first, and the subsequent incorporation of anti-TNF (TNFi) and other “biologics” have led to substantial improvements in RA clinical outcomes, enhancing the quality of life for millions of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Despite this progress, however, a significant question still remains unanswered: why do over 50% of RA patients with moderate to severe arthritis fail to respond appropriately to these agents? Pharmacomicrobiomics – an emerging field of study that investigates the effect of variations within the human gut microbiome on drugs – promises to overcome these barriers and facilitate precision medicine approaches in autoimmune disease.  Methotrexate (MTX), a dihydrofolate (DHF) reductase inhibitor, remains the anchor drug for the treatment of RA and is used widely throughout the world. While quite effective, oral MTX achieves significant results in less than 50% of patients and remission in only a quarter of them. It is well established that the inter-individual bioavailability of MTX is extremely variable, ranging from 10 to 80%. The reasons for this are presumably multifactorial. However, the intestinal microbiome and its enzymatic machinery are likely to play a significant role, based on our Preliminary Results and given that animals treated with antibiotics or kept under germ-free conditions show significant differences in MTX metabolism relative to control animals.  Our multidisciplinary team composed of rheumatologists, bioinformaticians, pharmacologists and microbiome researchers will address our overarching goal to study: a) if baseline intestinal microbiome, its genes, and associated metabolites can be used to predict the immunomodulatory responses to MTX in treatment-naïve, new-onset RA (NORA) patients; and b) if the gut microbiomes of MTX non-responders can be manipulated to modulate MTX metabolism and bioavailability. We believe that the results of our highly translational, innovative studies will directly influence therapeutic approaches for the treatment of RA and offer a more personalized approach in which the clinical efficacy response would be predicted early (and potentially improved by microbiome-targeted adjuvant therapies) in any given patient about to initiate MTX, limiting or preventing disease progression and ultimately avoiding wasteful health expenditures (estimated as ~$50,000/year/patient in direct costs). Importantly, we anticipate that our studies will establish generalizable approaches in rheumatology and autoimmunity that could be more broadly applied to the study and clinical maximization of other similar small molecules (e.g., JAK inhibitors) or even biologic agents (e.g., anti-TNF mAbs). NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread musculoskeletal inflammation affecting 1% of the world’s population (including ~2 million adults in the US alone). While the use of methotrexate (MTX) has significantly improved the lives of many people with RA, over 50% of patients do not respond adequately to this drug. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide key insights into the effects of the gut bacteria on MTX and the implications for prediction of clinical response, ultimately identifying patients that are either likely to improve even before this treatment is prescribed, or those that would benefit from microbiome-targeted interventions to improve MTX absorption and efficacy.",Employing the gut microbiome to accelerate effective initiation of rheumatoid arthritis therapy,9826831,R01AR074500,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitor', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Engraftment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Role', 'Series', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovitis', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'arthritis therapy', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'chronic autoimmune disease', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'disability', 'drug disposition', 'drug metabolism', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'germ free condition', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'joint destruction', 'joint injury', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome components', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'polyglutamates', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'rRNA Genes', 'recruit', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'rheumatologist', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'therapy outcome']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,734366,329565273,0.000954737406970648
"Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection PROJECT SUMMARY  Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2 billion individuals currently infected. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the most common form of TB infection affecting 13 million Americans. While many with LTBI remain asymptomatic, an estimated 10% of immunocompetent patients with LTBI will reactivate to active TB, and will become infectious. LTBI is treatable with a prolonged antibiotic treatment; however, potential side effects motivate the development of new diagnostic approaches that can identify with high specificity patients at the highest risk of reactivation, for who therapy would be most beneficial.  The tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are commonly used for TB and LTBI screening. Both tests provide good measures of TB exposure; however, neither is effective at diagnosing LTBI (positive predictive values <5%). Moreover, neither provide any prognostic stratification based upon reactivation risk. Both the TST and IGRAs probe immunological memory to TB-related antigen challenges and we hypothesize that a more nuanced and personalized approach to monitoring immune responses to both TB- specific and non-specific antigens might reveal new approaches to LTBI diagnosis and patient stratification.  Enabling a new, individualized approach to LTBI diagnostics, we propose to combine high throughput, multiplexed inflammatory biomarker detection strategies and powerful bioinformatics tools that allow for the identification of previously obscured multi-marker diagnostic signatures of LTBI status and reactivation risk. Silicon photonic microring resonators are an enabling technology for biomarker analysis due to their intrinsic scalability and multiplexing capabilities. Applied to the detection of cytokine panels, this technology supports the rapid immune profiling of individual samples under both TB-specific and non-specific antigen stimulation conditions. Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to analyze the resulting dense data streams to facilitate selection of key diagnostic signatures forming the basis for predictive model development and deployment. This powerful analytical combination is supplemented by deep expertise in clinical diagnosis and treatment of TB and LTBI, and an enabling collaboration and connection to subjects from an international location with high TB burden and exposure in a healthcare worker population subjected to regularly-scheduled and repeated LTBI screening.  The resulting diagnostic workflow and machine learning feature selection approaches will reveal multiplexed biomarker signatures that have strong positive predictive correlation with LTBI status (+ or -). This approach will also further stratify LTBI+ subjects on the basis of reactivation potential, thus providing a fundamentally new approach to identifying subjects that are most likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. The end result of this project will be a new precision medicine-based diagnostic strategy that is vastly superior to the current state-of-the-art and offers the potential to transform current clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tuberculosis (TB) affects an estimated one third of the world’s population and an asymptomatic latent state of tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is extremely common. Unfortunately, there are not any good clinical tests that can definitely diagnose LTBI, making it difficult to identify patients that should be treated to prevent reactivation to active TB, which is infectious. We will integrate cutting edge measurement technologies and machine learning bioinformatic approaches to identify and test multiplexed biomarker signatures that will transform clinical TB management by enabling personalized diagnosis of LTBI and the stratification of individuals with the highest potential for reactivation.",Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic biomarkers of latent TB infection,9819449,R01AI141591,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytokine Network Pathway', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regimen', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Silicon', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translations', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Whole Blood', 'antigen challenge', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'cytokine', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'high risk', 'immune function', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'latent infection', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,754111,641965656,0.02165448403592003
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",9900630,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'polypeptide C', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,800511,111231681,-0.0015786988167566015
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9666966,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'side effect', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,862336,327644200,-0.025035583257071937
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9724344,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Streptococcus vaccine', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2019,872121,46216755,-0.027581521251199104
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,9632837,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,914660,148463823,-0.05773045799926863
"A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy The purpose of this research is to provide a flexible prenatal genetic testing product that can be expanded to detect any inheritable trait as early as 5, and up to 20, weeks of gestation, from a safe, noninvasive Pap smear. Published studies, as well as our own experience, show that perinatal Pap collections using a cervical cytobrush pose no risk to mother or fetus, and captures trophoblast cells that migrate from the placenta into the reproductive tract. Trophoblast retrieval and isolation from the cervix (TRIC) efficiently isolates hundreds of trophoblast cells without limitations due to early gestational age, maternal obesity, or uteroplacental insufficiency disorders. In our report published in Science Translational Medicine, we isolated sufficient genomic DNA from intact fetal trophoblast cells obtained by TRIC at 5-19 weeks of gestation (n=20) to definitively distinguish maternal and fetal DNA by targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short terminal repeats (STRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to massively parallel sequencing of cell-free fetal DNA from maternal serum, which has a fetal fraction of only 4-10% at week 10 of gestation, the complete genome obtained by TRIC has a fetal fraction of 85-100%, and provides nucleotide-specific haplotyping. In our Phase I award, we developed this technology for prenatal genotyping of single gene disorders located on the hemoglobin B (HBB) gene, using custom multiplex PCR amplification of SNPs, STRs and loci across HBB for NGS. We successfully haplotyped the locus for the sickle cell disease (SCD) point mutation and genotyped the remainder of the HBB exome, which includes alternate SCD loci, beta thalassemias and anemias. In Phase II, we will expand the test to include HBA1 and HBA1 genes (alpha thalassemias) to provide a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy screen. Phase I studies revealed that genotyping was consistently accurate, unless cervical specimen collection was suboptimal and <40 trophoblast cells were isolated. Commercialization will require operators to obtain adequate specimens. We will accomplish six milestones towards commercialization of this test: 1. Incorporate the HBA1 and HBA2 loci into a comprehensive hemoglobinopathy test. 2. Optimize success rates through operator training and innovations in collection device designs to increase cervical cell recoveries. 3. Innovate a novel alternative method to cytobrush-based cervical collection. 4. Automate the TRIC processing pipeline for high throughput cell isolation, DNA purification and NGS. 5. Establish sample quality assessment tools powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. 6. Perform a clinical validation trial to assess test performance. With an estimated annual market potential over $284 million for prenatal hemoglobinopathies testing, the envisioned technology will fill an existing gap in clinical diagnostics and outcompete existing invasive prenatal testing. Our initial commercial product will to enable management of high-risk pregnancies and provide valuable information to physicians and patients in the process of establishing families. Specifically, this initial product will benefit pregnancies at risk of having a child with SCA or other hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and anemia. This research provides major public health benefits by leveraging a safe, noninvasive method to capture fetal cells that migrate into the reproductive tract from a Pap smear for development of genetic tests to identify women carrying a fetus with an inherited disorder. We will build a DNA sequencing kit that can be commercialized to determine the genotype of fetuses at risk for sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies as early as 5 weeks of pregnancy. Advances emerging from the proposed research will generate new clinical tools for managing pregnancy complications to benefit the well-being of mothers and their babies.","A Platform for Safe, Noninvasive Prenatal Genetic Testing at Five Weeks of Pregnancy",9776011,R44HD092205,"['African American', 'Amniocentesis', 'Anemia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Child', 'Chorion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conceptions', 'Conceptus', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA purification', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genotype', 'Germ Cells', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth', 'Haplotypes', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleotides', 'Other Genetics', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placenta', 'Point Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short Tandem Repeat', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specimen', 'Speculums', 'Technology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vagina', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'alpha-Thalassemia', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'cell free fetal DNA', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'exome', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'fetus at risk', 'fetus cell', 'flexibility', 'hemoglobin B', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maternal obesity', 'maternal serum', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'operation', 'performance tests', 'perinatal health', 'phase 1 study', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'reproductive', 'reproductive tract', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'testing services', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational medicine', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,"CRADLE GENOMICS, INC.",R44,2019,1098375,901625,-0.025146779665888814
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants.

"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community.

"New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, tuberculosis (TB) kills more people each year than any other infectious disease, but around 40% of TB cases go undiagnosed each year. This leads to continued transmission and a slow rate of decline in global TB incidence. Community-based TB screening interventions are one strategy for increasing the early diagnosis and treatment of people with tuberculosis. Knowledge is lacking on when community-based TB screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and on the impact of these interventions on TB transmission. This study addresses the first of these knowledge gaps by identifying epidemiologic signals that predict high yields for community-based TB screening, and by assessing barriers to optimal implementation of community-based screening programs. It addresses the second knowledge gap by measuring transmission within communities that receive TB screening interventions, and by identifying potential sites of transmission both within and outside the community. Aim 1 applies random forest regression to data from a community-based screening program to create a decision tree that uses information about past TB patients to predict whether a commnity is likely to have high levels of undiagnosed TB in the present. Aim 2 is a mixed-methods study focusing on people who were missed by TB screening interventions, which will help understand the barriers to successful implementation. Aim 3 uses whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates to determine the proportion of TB cases attributable to recent transmission within intervention communities, using this metric to evaluate the impact of screening interventions on transmission. Aim 4 uses social network analysis to identify sites of transmission within and outside intervention communities. The long-term goal of this work is to reduce global TB morbidity through improved community-based screening. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to understand (a) when community-based tuberculosis screening interventions are likely to be fruitful and (b) the impact these interventions have on tuberculosis transmission. This knowledge will improve community-based tuberculosis screening interventions and thus contribute to the reduction of global tuberculosis morbidity.",New approaches to optimizing the application and measuring the impact of community-based tuberculosis interventions,9781984,DP2MD015102,"['Address', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Network', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical sequencing', 'community intervention', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening program', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIMHD,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,DP2,2019,2353629,327644200,-0.014755284425668086
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9627935,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2019,2648073,415711940,0.005296755286050013
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9698505,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,50000,0,-0.031688894883928724
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9609312,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,69586,560644462,-0.03696310441456903
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9569720,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2018,77376,193405667,0.004623720919143887
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,161094826,-0.026769900888881478
"Extracellular Vesicles as a Link Between Placental and Renal Dysfunction in Preeclampsia PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia (PE) is a devastating hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It affects 2-10% of women and accounts for 16% of maternal deaths related to childbirth in developed countries. PE is difficult to study because it is a multifactorial disorder with varying molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with early onset, late onset, and severe PE. A personalized medicine approach applied to dissecting the underlying mechanisms of PE may be beneficial to reduce clinical incidence of this devastating syndrome. The placenta plays a key role in the development of PE, leading to widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and systemic multi-organ failure in PE. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing protein, RNA, and lipid cargo are continuously extruded from the placenta, and are capable of interacting with maternal organs including the kidney. PE is primarily associated with placental and renal dysfunction, and PE is the most common cause of acute kidney injury during pregnancy. However, no studies have investigated the potential of placenta-derived RNA cargo as a link between placental and renal dysfunction in PE. Urinary EVs are derived from multiple tissue types and represent a trove of biomarkers that are increasingly being utilized to diagnose renal disorders. Further, urine samples can be obtained throughout pregnancy non-invasively and could potentially be utilized to identify biomarkers related to placental dysfunction in PE. In the proposed research, during the mentored phase, cutting-edge RNA-Seq technology coupled with computational biological and machine learning approaches will be applied to profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs in women with PE compared to normal pregnancy. Preliminary data indicates that it is possible to isolate and profile the transcriptome of urinary EVs from maternal urine throughout normal gestation, and that placenta-derived and placenta-specific mRNA and miRNA can be detected within the urinary EV population. This presents a novel technique that has potential to identify biomarkers as well as provide information on placental dysfunction in PE in a non-invasive manner. During the independent phase, the candidate will utilize an in vitro approach to investigate the effect of uptake of placenta-derived EVs with miRNA cargo associated with PE on the function of proximal tubule epithelial cells and cortical collecting duct cells. These two renal-specific cell types are involved in tubular reabsorption in the nephron, a process that is compromised leading to increased excretion of protein in the urine in some preeclamptic pregnancies. This proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing basic biology, clinical research, and high-performance computing applied to investigating placental dysfunction in PE. These experiments are significant because they will generate novel information on the role of placenta- derived EVs in renal dysfunction in PE, as well as point the way towards preventative and therapeutic targets that may be transformative and clinically relevant.

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,9708373,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,143095,148463823,-0.05773045799926863
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9460547,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'vascular risk factor']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2018,166104,570146095,-0.01815027303030487
"Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama Antibodies are a key component of the adaptive immune system, released in response to disease in order to target foreign molecular surfaces. Due to their capacity for high target affinity and specificity, they’ve become one of the fastest growing classes of therapeutic molecules addressing a range of disease including infectious diseases, auto-immune diseases, and cancer. Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development.

"Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity Project Summary  It is well recognized that current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit two critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no consideration for potency, and virtually no information is provided about molecular targets and mechanisms. These deficiencies in hazard characterization prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where this information is essential. We will address these major problems with current in vitro mammalian cell genetic toxicity assays by developing methods and associated commercial assay kits that dramatically enhance throughput capacity, and delineate genotoxicants' primary molecular targets, while simultaneously providing information about potency. Once biomarkers and a family of multiplexed assays have been developed for these purposes, an interlaboratory trial will be performed with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods. Project Narrative  DNA damage that cannot be faithfully repaired results in gene mutation and/or chromosomal aberrations, and these effects are known to contribute to cancer and other severe diseases. Thus, there is an important need for sensitive assays to evaluate chemicals for genotoxic and other deleterious effects. The work proposed herein will address issues that have plagued genotoxicity assessments for the last several decades: low throughput, lack of potency metrics, and little to no information about molecular targets. We will address these major problems with current genetic toxicity assays by developing new methods and associated commercial assay kits.",Next Generation Testing Strategies for Assessment of Genotoxicity,9465735,R44ES029014,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aneugens', 'Antioxidants', 'Appearance', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Bleomycin', 'Caspase', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Colcemid', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-PKcs', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Epitopes', 'Etoposide', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'GADD45A gene', 'Gamma-H2AX', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intercalating Agents', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Microtubules', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment', 'Schedule', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Stains', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'clastogen', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genotoxicity', 'hazard', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'next generation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'repaired', 'response', 'targeted agent', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'virtual']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2018,178854,651293,-0.021850628063989675
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,673201228,0.007843286900440284
"MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy parkinsonian type (MSA-P), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are costly and devastating neurodegenerative diseases. They have overlapping clinical manifestations and diagnosis remains challenging in many cases. Thus far no effective treatments have been developed to meaningfully slow or stop their progression. This is due in part to a lack of tools to objectively measure degeneration in the neural systems affected by each of these diseases. Availability of such tools would assist clinical diagnosis, facilitate selection of appropriate patient groups for trial recruitment, and enable objective measurement of treatment outcomes. Recent MRI studies suggest that disease-specific brain changes can, indeed, be identified in these parkinsonian diseases. The objective of this research is to identify univariable markers and multivariable MRI signatures that capture distinct patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to accurately distinguish these diseases.  To accomplish this the investigators use 3 Tesla MRI contrasts sensitive to key features of neurodegeneration to 1) identify structures damaged by PD, MSA-P and PSP and 2) to quantify the extent of damage in each neural system in parkinsonian diseases. Specifically, the investigators use neuromelanin- sensitive MRI to measure neuromelanin loss and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and R2* imaging to measure iron accumulation in patients with PD, MSA-P, and PSP. Using these contrasts and an innovative region of interest (ROI) selection approach, they reproducibly measure patterns of neurodegenerative change across neural systems. In Aim 1 the investigators use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI to study neuromelanin loss in PD, MSA-P and PSP in to identify univariable disease features that are differentially affected by parkinsonian diseases and may assist distinguishing these conditions. In Aim 2 they use QSM and R2* MRI to study ROIs differentially impacted by PD, MSA-P and PSP to identify iron accumulation biomarkers to help distinguish these diseases. In Aim 3 the investigators apply machine learning classification algorithms to identify multivariable MRI signatures of neurodegenerative change across neural systems to differentiate PD, MSA-P and PSP. Study outputs will be candidate MRI biomarkers and disease signatures. The long term goal of this research is to further develop these outputs for use as clinical diagnostic tools and as biomarkers for subject selection and outcome measurement in clinical trials.  Through this career award Dr. Huddleston will gain new skills in MRI methods, data science, and neural systems imaging in parkinsonian diseases. These new skills will enable Dr. Huddleston to design and lead interdisciplinary neuroimaging biomarker studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders. His mentor team is comprised of leaders in their fields. This team and the dynamic research environment at Emory University provide the necessary support for Dr. Huddleston to successfully transition to scientific independence. There is an urgent public health need for new treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and objective tools to distinguish these diseases for clinical and research purposes are lacking. The outputs of the proposed research will be candidate MRI biomarkers and multivariable MRI signatures to differentiate these conditions. These candidate biomarkers may be developed for use in clinical trial designs to increase their odds of success, and they may also assist clinical diagnosis.",MRI Signatures of Neuromelanin and Iron Pathology in Parkinsonism,9666652,K23NS105944,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical assessments', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement Disorders', 'Multiple System Atrophy', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Progressive Supranuclear Palsy', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Red nucleus structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Subjects Selections', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromelanin', 'neuron loss', 'nigrostriatal system', 'novel', 'pars compacta', 'patient screening', 'putamen', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,192564,507546965,0.0041070163449094905
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness.

"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,981315,-0.014067680406547555
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,229500,338121506,-0.014838261964467822
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9441722,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2018,249000,29585825,0.0003814577316817956
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,9512848,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B Therapy', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive service', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'care providers', 'case control', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2018,273336,7292939,-0.008600227359638103
"Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags Project Summary Cost-effective, and accurate sequencing of RNA, composed of both canonical and modified bases, of any length, without conversion to cDNA, and without amplification are the objectives of this project, and the ultimate goal is to sequence the transcriptome, and determine in a time-sensitive manner relative distribution of its components. Such accomplishment will directly impact prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease and materialize the promise of personalized medicine. Current methods, such as Illumina's RNA-Seq, and the single molecule approaches of Pacific Biosciences and of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, still lag behind in many of the critical attributes mentioned above. The unresolved issue with nanopore-based sequencing is the observation that ion current vs. time recording does not refer to a single nucleobase, but to a short sequence of 4 or more bases. The problem, partially resolved with the use of sophisticated algorithms and learning machines, appears intractable for RNA that includes numerous post-transcriptional base modifications. As an illustration, if a nanopore reads a sequence of 4 bases and the specific RNA to be sequenced has a total of 8 different nucleobases (4 canonical and 4 modified), then 48 = 65,536 signals need to be discriminated from within an ion current range of 20 to 40 pA with a standard deviation of ±1 pA; this is an impossible computational task. However, if the nanopore could sense one base at a time and yield distinct ion current for each base, there will be only 8 different recordings to distinguish from, a much simpler task. Our own published results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides conjugated with a pyrimidine-specific tag (Osmium tetroxide 2,2'-bipyrimidine or OsBp) yield enzyme-free, slow/readable translocation via α- Hemolysin, and distinct ion current levels for intact, T(OsBp), and C(OsBp) bases, suggesting that a single tag can yield sequencing information on purine, T, and C. The latter leads to the conjecture that the presence of a second, purine-specific, label would allow identification of all four canonical bases. Furthermore each tag has intrinsic selectivity for one base over another, and this will provide a handle for additional discrimination among the modified bases. In this phase I proposal we aim to demonstrate (i) near 100% labeling (true positives) with 0% internucleotide bond cleavage, and 0% false positives for RNA(OsBp), as we have already shown for DNA(OsBp), (ii) comparable labeling attributes for a purine-specific tag, and (iii) readable translocation with single pyrimidine base discrimination for RNA(OsBp). Success in these efforts will lead to single base discrimination and sequencing of RNA, including a number of post-transcriptionally modified bases, and pave the road for sequencing the transcriptome. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in personalized medicine for diagnosis and treatment of disease require sequencing the RNA transcriptome with technologies that are currently unavailable.

"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing The goal of this Phase I SBIR proposal is to demonstrate utility to all major pathogenic bacterial strains of SeLux’s rapid, low-cost, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) system (fast-AST or FAST). Utilizing existing optical detectors and standard dried antibiotic microplates, and avoiding pitfalls of metabolic probes, FAST will potentially transform therapy of infections by significantly accelerating AST, thereby facilitating treatment with the optimal antibiotic. Aim 1 will apply FAST to hundreds of samples of pathogenic bacterial strains, while developing and optimizing a predictive algorithm for clinical utility. Aim 2 will extend the FAST platform to slow-growing strains and species as well. SeLux has demonstrated FAST to exceed FDA 510(k) requirements for minimum inhibitory concentration determinations for 25+ strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with full antibiotic panels. Completion of the proposed aims will expand FAST to all major clinically-relevant, non-fastidious bacterial pathogens. SeLux’s interdisciplinary team has expertise in nanosensing, microbiology, and algorithm design and is buttressed by distinguished experts in Clinical Microbiology, Infectious Disease, and Machine Learning. The new paradigm in clinical medicine is value-based healthcare, which requires rapid and accurate diagnoses leading to optimal patient treatment. Nowhere is this more important than in treating infections, where doctors are currently forced to overprescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics during an agonizing 48+ hour wait for antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) results. The novel, rapid, low-cost AST platform described in this proposal promises to reduce this delay in treatment by as much as 30 hours. This advance would be transformative for the treatment of infections because current over-use of broad-spectrum antibiotics not only harms individual patients but is a primary contributor to the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance.","FAST platform for same-shift, complete antibiotic menu antibiotic susceptibility testing",9464993,R43AI136125,"['Agreement', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amplifiers', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'End Point Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Invaded', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Quality of Care', 'Reagent', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Affairs', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vancomycin', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'combat', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detector', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'nanosensors', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'performance tests', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis']",NIAID,"SELUX DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,298851,1000000,-0.007910255112361224

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,9410515,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,323434,758431960,-0.048827446129353594
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9511925,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'surgery outcome', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,328340,641965656,0.0016257394267105893
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9502388,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,340491,558628098,-0.022654240879752437
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9406857,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,351001,570146095,-0.011685374190732383
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9395904,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,352587,533594881,-0.00943684888527907
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9505946,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,387714,377931988,-0.0020333299551710178
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets. Further emphasis is placed on utilization of other –omics to develop microbiome based prediction models in pregnancy outcomes, improving early detection of women who are at risk of preterm delivery.",Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types,9577818,R01GM129512,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Human Genome Project', 'Joints', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Target', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'population stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'user friendly software', 'vaginal microbiome']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,396000,758431960,-0.019086786595198142
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9472335,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,418408,415711940,0.006361805284375505
"The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease Project Summary/Abstract This is a first R01 application from an early stage, new investigator and current NIEHS K01 awardee. Parkinson disease (PD) is a disabling neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure. Years before the diagnosis of PD and the onset of motor symptoms, PD patients develop non-motor symptoms, including, importantly, constipation and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Constipation affects over 80% of PD patients and is one of the strongest risk factors for PD. Recent research shows that the enteric nervous system in the gut and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve which anatomically links the GI system to the brain, are among the first and most severely affected by alpha-synuclein pathology characteristic of PD5 leading to the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal tract might be the site of initiation of PD. We propose to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the relation between human gut microbiome and PD, focusing on the pre- onset microbiome. We will do this by building on an ongoing Department of Defense funded project that has identified participants with pre-parkinson syndrome (PPS - defined as the co- occurrence of constipation, pRBD (probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) and hyposmia) that in a pilot study has been associated with a ~200 fold increase in PD risk. Studying the microbiome among this group, who are highly likely to develop PD or are already in the premotor state, will give us a unique look at the microbiome in PD patients prior to any potential disease-associated effects of changes in diet and lifestyle that may have confounded prior case-control studies. The proposed study will take advantage of 25 years of prospectively collected data on environmental and dietary exposures and disease outcomes in two prospective cohorts of men and women. Project Narrative Our appreciation of the impact of the gut microbiome on brain health, and especially PD, is in the early stages. This study will be the first to examine the gut microbiome in participants with premotor PD and compare it to healthy controls, controls with constipation and to recently onset PD cases. This project will thus advance our understanding of how the human gut microbiome contributes to the pathophysiology of PD and will contribute to the development of tools needed for a preclinical diagnosis and/or treatment.",The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson Disease,9343057,R01NS097723,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Bacteria', 'Biometry', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Butyrates', 'Caffeine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Constipation', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Department of Defense', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enteric Nervous System', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Feces', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Health Professional', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Pilot Projects', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteobacteria', 'REM Sleep Behavior Disorder', 'Ralstonia', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Woman', 'alpha synuclein', 'brain health', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'dorsal motor nucleus', 'dysbiosis', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hyposmia', 'illness length', 'men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota profiles', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'posture instability', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'stool sample', 'tool development']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,418825,7208224,0.02965688374186027
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases No other group of diseases encompasses a greater pathophysiology than do the rheumatic diseases. Spanning multiple organ systems, clinical decisions often rely on coordinated efforts from primary care providers and rheumatologists to rule in or rule out differential diagnoses when treating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). RA is a symmetric, inflammatory, peripheral polyarthritis leading to deformity of joints via erosion of bone and surrounding cartilage. SLE can affect virtually any organ leading to fatigue, fever, myalgia, weight change and complications associated with renal, central nervous system, and hematologic systems can be life-threatening. RA and SLE are diagnosed through clinical judgment after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the case of both diseases, individual laboratory tests are effective only in a portion of the disease population. Across these analyses, the sensitivity and specificity for these laboratory measurements may have high specificity to rule in SLE but lack sensitivity as these diagnostic markers can be found in other disorders. As a physician colleague pointed out, “it is difficult to diagnose a negative”. Diagnostic approaches for both RA and SLE often rely on multiple, independent laboratory tests combined with clinical observation. Distinguishing between these diseases is important since treatment procedures for these diseases are different. Time is a factor in diagnosis of these diseases and tools are required to facilitate earlier diagnosis as treatment for autoimmune diseases are highly effective and early initiation of therapy leads to the best outcomes. Misdiagnosis of these conditions is not uncommon. Another common disease seen by rheumatologists is fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). FMS is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain that affects tendons, ligaments, and muscle. FMS is difficult to diagnose and treat and a critical clinical point is that FMS is not explained by another rheumatic or systemic disorder. Thus, FMS is a diagnosis of exclusion once other etiologies have been considered and excluded. RA and SLE are two diseases that must be eliminated from the differential diagnosis. Given the complicated diagnostic process these patients are often forced to endure, recent studies have also suggested that healthcare dollars are saved post-diagnosis and patient outcomes improve. To date, there is no laboratory test that can determine presence or absence of these three conditions from a single blood sample.  The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on FMS and the rheumatic diseases as disease categories and have identified and validated FMS and rheumatic disease-associated associated differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include 1) subjects with fibromyalgia syndrome, 2) healthy controls, 3) rheumatoid arthritis, 4) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 5) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S. and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic diseases from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome and other rheumatic diseases can be a difficult, long and costly process and misdiagnosis of these diseases is not uncommon. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate diagnosis is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess greater accuracy to identify fibromyalgia syndrome and rheumatic disease and provide meaningful clinical information to health- care providers faced with these diagnostic dilemmas.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to distinguish fibromyalgia syndrome from rheumatic diseases,9555179,R44AI129147,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deformity', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Europe', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mixed Connective Tissue Disease', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Myalgia', 'Neuraxis', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'bone erosion', 'care providers', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder control', 'human disease', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'phase 1 study', 'rheumatologist', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,498258,499995,-0.005521723747476093
"A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device ABSTRACT This project will create the first objective measurement tool, the VisBox, for the vision subtype of concussion (VSC). This will enable physicians to identify VSC without an eye-care professional, for referral to a vision specialist for personalized vision therapy recommendations. The persistence of concussion symptoms beyond several weeks is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, and children are particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties. A lack of accessible, objective vision diagnostics are critical barriers to identification of VSC and referral for treatment. The VisBox will be a software product that is used with the OcuTracker, Oculogica’s proprietary eye-tracking hardware platform. The VisBox will input eye movement measurements from the OcuTracker, calculate metrics that correspond to aspects of cranial nerve function affected during a concussion, and use those metrics to calculate a score to predict VSC using an algorithm developed with guided machine learning in the course of this study. The VisBox will be used by non- vision specialists to objectively measure three vision disorders related to concussion: convergence insufficiency (CI), accommodative insufficiency (AI), and saccadic dysfunction (SD) in under 4 minutes, during the clinical visit where the concussion is diagnosed. The long-term goal is to develop an objective assessment of vision characteristics, that will enable physicians that are non-specialists in vision to 1) screen for concussion-related vision disorders; 2) identify VSC; 3) make decisions about the necessity of a referral for a comprehensive vision examination; 4) monitor the effectiveness of vision treatment. Phase I Hypothesis. VisBox can produce an output score that correlates with the presence or absence of TBI- related vision disorder, i.e., VSC, by leveraging the OcuTracker visual stimulus and eye tracking system. Specific Aim I. Generate OcuTracker eye tracking data and the diagnosis of TBI-related vision disorder in 250 pediatric concussion patients. Specific Aim II. Develop and validate VisBox algorithm for assessing CI, AI, and SD using OcuTracker data. Plans for Phase II. The VisBox score will be used to predict responsiveness to vision therapy in a prospective randomized clinical study. Phase II will be a multi-armed study comparing vision therapy with placebo therapy in concussion patients and assessing whether the VisBox software can predict which patients are responsive to vision therapy. Commercial Opportunity. VisBox customers are non-eye care specialists including neurologists, pediatricians, emergency room physicians, sports medicine physicians, and concussion specialists. The total addressable market is $400M, assuming 4M annual scans at $100/scan needed for concussions in the US. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT At least 4 million concussions occur in the US each year, and up to 30% of these injuries persist beyond 4 weeks in a condition known as persistent post-concussion symptoms, which is often a life-altering situation for affected individuals, with children particularly vulnerable as they are at risk for co-morbidities such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and learning difficulties – with often serious consequences. The lack of an accessible, objective vision diagnostics presents a critical barrier to identification of the vision disorder concussion sub-type (VSC) and referral for treatment. The proposed technology will be the first objective tool that can be used by non-vision-specialists to identify concussion-related vision symptoms that is accessible to a broad range of facilities and will enable non-specialist physicians the ability to refer patients to concussion specialists to improve outcomes, decrease the time it takes patients to return to work or play, and reduce healthcare costs associated with this debilitating condition.",A software tool for objective identification of concussion-related vision disorders using a novel eye-tracking device,9465330,R41NS103698,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Brain Concussion', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Monitor', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Optometrist', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Post-Concussion Syndrome', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vision', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visit', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'chronic pain', 'commercial application', 'concussive symptom', 'disabling symptom', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'handheld equipment', 'improved outcome', 'lens', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,"OCULOGICA, INC.",R41,2018,503162,0,-0.031688894883928724
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9536156,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,563079,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9503015,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2018,664486,28472699,0.004152072681071871
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,9530040,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,680760,148463823,-0.05773045799926863
"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis Project Summary Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no clinical test to distinguish those that will progress to active TB disease, from those that will not. If we are to realize the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a world free of TB by 2035, the massive reservoir of TB infection must be addressed with a cost-effective, ethical therapy for preventing progression, based on treating only those most likely to progress. A diagnostic test that can accurately predict the risk of progression is critical for treating these high-risk individuals and the eradication of TB. Our goal is to develop such an assay. Our central hypothesis is that five independent host immune biomarkers, combined into a single multimetric signature will predict progression from latent to active TB with at least 90% sensitivity and specificity. We will test this hypothesis and achieve our goal by implementing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Compile a comprehensive dataset of biomarkers in a prospective cohort of individuals who are at risk of progressing to active TB. Working with the Moldova Ministry of Health's National TB Program, we will enroll 3,685 close contacts of active TB cases. All participants will be followed for two years to determine who progresses to active TB. We expect to identify ≥ 140 progressors. We will assess three previously established blood-based predictors of active TB progression, and two novel assays. We will verify the performance of previously published biomarkers in this population to discriminate progressors from non-progressors and identify new candidate biomarkers using RNA-Seq of antigen stimulated PBMC and detection of Mtb-peptides by NanoDisk MS. Aim 2: Use a discovery set of samples to develop predictive models of progression to active TB. Using data from 140 progressors and 140 non-progressors from Aim 1 we will (1) Verify the performance of existing biomarkers, (2) Use a cross-validation to identify new candidate biomarkers, and (3) derive predictive models using logistic regression and machine learning methods to identify optimal biomarker signatures that best predict progression to active TB within 12 months. Aim 3: Verify the ability of the model to predict progression to active TB disease. Using the same approach as Aim 1, we will enroll a new set of 1,340 household contacts of active TB and identify at least 60 progressors and 60 matched non-progressors and verify clinically the sensitivity/specificity of our models and biosignatures (Aim 2) to predict progression to active disease. A combined host biomarker signature that can predict TB progression from a small blood volume will have significant impact on the WHO End TB Program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Almost 2 billion people are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Approximately 10% of these individuals will progress to active TB disease over their lifetimes, but there is currently no test to distinguish those that will progress from those that will not. We propose to develop a multimetric signature of host biomarkers that together will have a sensitivity and specificity of ≥ 90% for predicting progression to active TB in one year, a critical first step to developing cost-effective and ethical treatment plans in order to reach the World Health Organization goal of Ending TB by 2035.",Identifying individuals at risk of progression to active tuberculosis,9501395,R01AI137681,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Individual', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Moldova', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens', 'National Health Programs', 'Organizational Objectives', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'World Health Organization', 'age group', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker performance', 'biosignature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deep neural network', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'monocyte', 'nanodisk', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'programs', 'research clinical testing', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transmission process', 'treatment planning']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,798023,524978793,0.020457106782432222
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9457491,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,863172,327644200,-0.025035583257071937
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9502903,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2018,879004,46216755,-0.027581521251199104
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,329565273,-0.022729093092214218
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,9464147,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'desensitization', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,1524997,415711940,0.010461415984761736
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,9455006,U19AI135972,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'virus pathogenesis']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2018,2799687,415711940,0.005296755286050013
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9345356,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylase', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'desensitization', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,38039,66720547,-0.0085372785530801
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,9315945,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'graph theory', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'network dysfunction', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2017,132354,292134808,0.008446280490354686
"Optimizing electrical impedance myography outcomes through data mining Project summary  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that is based on the application of a weak, high frequency electrical current to a muscle and the measurement of the resulting surface voltages. The further development and application of EIM remains the main business focus of Skulpt, Inc, a small business concern based in Boston and San Francisco (Specific Aims just say San Francisco). Alterations to the condition of the muscle, including myocyte atrophy, fat and connective tissue deposition, and inflammation all alter the EIM data in predictable and consistent ways. To date, through Skulpt, EIM has been applied as a potential biomarker for assessing disease progression and response to therapy in a wide variety of neuromuscular disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and spinal muscular atrophy, as well as other disorders that impact muscle condition, such as disuse atrophy and sarcopenia (age related muscle loss); over 1000 people have been studied with Skulpt’s EIM technology. Whereas the results of these applications are promising, the analytic approaches taken to the data sets have been fairly basic, utilizing only simple single frequency or simplistic multifrequency values. However, with every single muscle measurement, over 240 individual data points are acquired at different frequencies, different depths of muscle penetration, and at different angles to the major muscle fiber direction. Moreover, each of the above studies has been done in isolation, and thus how results differ between diseases is unknown. Given the plethora of data, applying more sophisticated analytic approaches has the potential of yielding improved EIM measures. Moreover, collaborators have already collected an associated wealth of animal EIM data that will help further inform this analysis. Thus, in this proposed Phase 1 SBIR, we plan to apply a variety of data mining techniques to the vast set of data already accumulated at Skulpt, Inc such that improved EIM outcomes can be developed and implemented. In Specific Aim 1, we will study human data across all disease types evaluated to determine which data sets are most effective at discriminating diseased from healthy muscle as well as distinguishing between diseases. In Specific Aim 2, we will focus on finding the metrics that are most sensitive to the degree of muscle pathology in a specific disease. In both of these aims, we will evaluate how these new metrics are mirrored in already obtained animal data. In Specific Aim 3, we will study these metrics in a new set of data (a test set) that was not used to develop the analytical paradigms so as to ensure their robustness. With the conclusion of this work, we will plan to pursue a Phase 2 SBIR that will focus on the development of a software suite to assist in EIM data interpretation based upon these results followed by a prospective observational clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of these newly developed metrics for disease diagnosis and tracking of progression/response to therapy. Project Narrative  Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive technology for the assessment of muscle that remains the main focus of Skulpt, Inc.

"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9279027,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'CCL26 gene', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Standardization', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'illness length', 'immunoreactivity', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,156324,507546965,-0.0028461681906160148
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9238793,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2017,166104,570146095,-0.01815027303030487
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,607172798,-0.020650949696151673
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9308943,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Genetic', 'Glycosides', 'IGA Glomerulonephritis', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Standardization', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'exhaustion', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2017,200347,558628098,-0.0002823715301815373
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,673201228,0.007843286900440284
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9394884,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2017,249000,29585825,0.0003814577316817956
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,9297272,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Therapy', 'Hepatitis C', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive service', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Virus', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'case control', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2017,273336,7292939,-0.008600227359638103
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed work will be applied to evaluate new antimicrobials and support development of hybrid vaccines.",UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides,9320998,R01GM103655,"['Acylation', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affinity', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Glycolipids', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Infection', 'Ions', 'Lipid A', 'Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Pathway', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'O Antigens', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance', 'Serotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tail', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'hydrophilicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'inorganic phosphate', 'instrument', 'method development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'screening', 'sugar', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'ultraviolet']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2017,297043,91740242,-0.0900324947109093
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9325499,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,317128,641965656,-0.010366510657509828
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8996183,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient population', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2017,323753,758431960,-0.048827446129353594
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9275549,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical translation', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,330348,641965656,0.0016257394267105893
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,570146095,-0.011685374190732383
"Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures Project Summary:  Neuropsychiatric disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus underscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have a late onset and slow progression, the diagnostic criteria are based on subjective clinical symptoms, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. In the proposed work, we aim to tackle these chal- lenges by leveraging complementary contributions from multiple biomarkers, including genome-wide polymor- phisms, whole brain neuroimaging, bioﬂuids, and comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments. We develop sophisticated analytic tools with higher resolution and improved accuracy by accounting for biological mecha- nisms of disease, synthesizing dynamic system-wide information, and integrating multiple sources of biomarkers. These methods are applied to clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large international consortia in order to model the earliest pathological changes of neurodegenerative disease, assess treatment responses, and inform the design of early-intervention clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we develop efﬁcient methods for multi-level semiparametric transformation mod- els to estimate and test the risk of genetic variants on various types of complex phenotypes to inform genetic counseling and improve clinical trial efﬁciency. Our methods do not rely on full pedigree genotyping and provide family-speciﬁc substructure, in addition to population substructure, to better control confounding and reduce false discovery rates in genome-wide association studies. In Aim 2, we develop large-scale nonlinear dynamic sys- tems through ordinary differential equations with random inﬂections to understand early pathological changes and identify subjects with preclinical signs. Our method provides multi-domain integration of ensembles of biomarker dynamics. In Aim 3, we develop dynamic hazards models and incorporate dynamic network structures to estimate biomarker proﬁles that evolve smoothly with disease progression for earlier disease diagnosis. We account for irregularly measured biomarkers and biological network dependence among biomarkers. In Aim 4, we develop doubly robust and efﬁcient machine learning methods to identify predictive markers, estimate optimal individu- alized therapies, and identify subgroups who may receive the greatest beneﬁt from therapy, with minimal risk. In each aim, we will validate the proposed methods through extensive simulation studies and demonstrate their practical value via application to real-world clinical studies. We establish theoretical properties of the proposed methods using modern empirical process theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art ana- lytic methods proposed here will substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research com- munity. Project Narrative:  The ultimate goal of neuropsychiatric research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay disease on- set, slow disease progression, and provide effective treatment at each stage of disease. This proposal aims to develop new statistical approaches to integrate complementary sources of information from genomic measures, brain imaging biomarkers, and early clinical signs to characterize disease mechanism, progression, and treatment responses, and thereby inform the design of clinical trials and the discovery of optimal personalized therapies.",Statistical methods for early disease prediction and treatment strategy estimation using biomarker signatures,9308279,R01NS073671,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Equation', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hazard Models', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Late-Onset Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'dynamic system', 'effective therapy', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minimal risk', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'randomized trial', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'validation studies']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,366940,558628098,-0.022654240879752437
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,9443649,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Infant Mortality', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,376620,377931988,-0.0020333299551710178
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,9216965,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,388615,533594881,-0.00943684888527907
"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9250167,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'age group', 'age related', 'aging population', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,400107,415711940,0.006361805284375505
"Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD Abstract Up to 80% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) will suffer from cognitive symptoms, including impaired attention, planning, reasoning and working memory as well as hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, and delusions. These impairments lead to mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD) in PD. Cognitive symptoms of PD are associated with enormous cost to our society. There are no clear biomarkers and few effective treatments for PD-MCI/PDD. Because risk for PD increases dramatically with age, this problem will surge as our population grows older. The mechanisms contributing to PD-MCI/PDD are unknown. Our group has found that low-frequency (1-8 Hz; or delta/theta bands) brain rhythms might be helpful in diagnosing cognitive dysfunction in PD. This delta/theta activity originates from areas of medial frontal cortex such as the anterior cingulate, and is detectable by mid-frontal scalp EEG electrodes. We have found that mid-frontal delta/theta brain rhythms are engaged when healthy individuals detect novelty, errors, and conflict, or make decisions. These rhythms are attenuated in PD patients. Our working model is that PD patients manifest diverse neuronal and network deficits that impair mid-frontal delta/theta activity, leading to failures in engaging cognitive control. These abnormalities contribute to PD-MCI and PDD. In this proposal we combine `big-data' machine learning tools, intraoperative neurophysiology in humans, and new brain-stimulation paradigms to investigate the role of mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms in PD. We will test the overall hypothesis that mid-frontal delta/theta impairments are a mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in PD. In Aim 1 we will determine if mid-frontal delta/theta activity predicts PD-MCI/PDD. In Aim 2 we will use unique intraoperative recordings to determine how delta/theta activity within medial frontal cortex influences neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, a key site of functional convergence that is targeted by current deep-brain stimulation for PD. Notably, the subthalamic nucleus is a compact structure that receives highly overlapping input from cognitive and motor cortical regions, making it likely that our recordings will capture cognitive processing within this nucleus. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine if subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation at delta/theta frequencies improves cognitive control in PD patients. Because these experiments involve recordings across several PD patient populations (Aim 1), from single subthalamic neurons (Aim 2), and brain stimulation (Aim 3), each of these aims will provide independent mechanistic insight into cognitive dysfunction in PD. PD is a complex disease, but if cortical EEG abnormalities are a consistent theme it might inspire new diagnostic tools or new brain-stimulation therapies for cognitive dysfunction in PD. Results from this proposal could also be important for other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease.     Public Health Relevance Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are an enormous public health problem. Here, we will ana- lyze brain rhythms that are involved in cognitive processing and also dysfunctional in Parkinson's dis- ease. We will use these brain rhythms to guide novel brain stimulation that has the potential to treat dementia and cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease.  ",Mid-frontal delta/theta rhythms and cognitive control in PD,9445918,R01NS100849,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alpha Rhythm', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Delusions', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reaction Time', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'alpha synuclein', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'implantation', 'improved', 'insight', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'motor symptom', 'neuronal patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2017,403257,193405667,0.004623720919143887
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease.

"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9313961,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Women&apos', 's Health Nursing', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,563079,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9269122,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost effective', 'design', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'guided inquiry', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mechanical properties', 'microvesicles', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'perinatal medicine', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2017,725442,28472699,0.004152072681071871
"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9264015,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Memory impairment', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,877276,327644200,-0.025035583257071937
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,9052846,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment response', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,1,641965656,-0.012812195721415828
"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,9128403,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,23668,148186688,-0.008758593584903445
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,47354375,-0.09264735428528015
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9195237,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,37571,66720547,-0.0085372785530801
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9125796,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning network', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2016,109620,524978793,0.0003814577316817956
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment.

Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,98796731,-0.021513494199227615
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,9084432,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,156324,507546965,-0.0028461681906160148
"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,9024612,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'peptidomimetics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2016,166104,570146095,-0.01815027303030487
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit.

"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,86807134,0.0035343893891735586
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,673201228,0.007843286900440284
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,9112964,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive service', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'abstracting', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'case control', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2016,209012,7292939,-0.008600227359638103
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,9088345,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,327644200,-0.040761655036283546
"Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The glycosylation patterns on IgA1 antibodies are highly complex and heterogeneous. When there are dysregulations in activities of glycosylation enzymes, the hinge domain of IgA1's, i.e., the peptide domain connecting constant and variable regions, can undergo shifts in glycosylation patterns and become galactose- deficient (Gd). The galactose deficiency, together with other triggers, can lead to an auto-immune response in which patients' own antibodies form complexes with Gd-IgA1's; these complexes precipitate and cause damage in glomeruli, eventually leading to IgA1 nephropathy (IgAN).  It is of a great interest to monitor regularly Gd-IgA1's of patients who are predisposed to develop nephropathy. Further, increased understanding of correlations between dynamic variations in glycosylation patterns and the natural development of the disease in individual patients is expected to lead to improved interventions, including individually optimized therapies that could block the formation of offending complexes. None of the current approaches to assess microheterogeneity in glycosylation patterns is completely satisfactory; while elegant, these are also arduous and indirect, limited to highly specialized laboratories and difficult to reproduce in actual patients' samples, in large part due to lack of precise, well-characterized, molecular-level analytical tools  We propose to address this issue by systematic isolation of oligonucleotide-based molecular receptors or aptamers that will interact with clusters of different O-glycosides displayed in the hinge subregions. Aptameric receptors will be isolated from large oligonucleotide pools through the process of an in vitro selection and amplification coupled to the affinity separation via interactions with IgA1 hinge regions isolated from both Gd- IgAN patients and healthy controls. Individual aptamers will interact with substructures within the hinge domain, that is, with shorter peptides displaying one or more oligosaccharides. A large number of identified aptamers will be screened for their ability to interact with fractions of polyclonal IgA1's, and a variety of those aptamers that show a quantitatively different response to IgA1s from patients and matched controls will be selected for a more detailed characterization and incorporation in ""classification sensor arrays"" (CSAs).  As the result of our work, we will have immediately a set of aptamers that would together form a classification sensor array, an artificial ""nose"" capable of distinguishing samples belonging to patients with Gd- IgAN from healthy controls, as well as quantifying the extent of shifts in glycosylation patterns. Further molecular-level characterizatio of epitopes (subdomains) that these aptamers recognize is expected to enable studies towards identification of structures that are responsible for auto-immune responses in individual patients, and correlation with secondary triggers of diseases, which are the key step in the rational design of targeted inhibitors of the complex formation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Complex saccharide structures ('glycans') play crucial roles in a wide range of biological functions and diseases such as autoimmunity, cancer, and nephropathy. We will help elucidate the role of complex glycans in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, one of the most common causes of kidney failure worldwide, by systematically and exhaustively generating oligonucleotide-based receptors (aptamers) for glycan clusters on IgA1 antibodies. This will allow new diagnostic protocols based on pattern recognition with classification arrays and, in the long-term, personalized therapies to prevent antigen-autoantibody interaction and nephropathy.            ",Aptamer-Based Arrays for Detection of Pathogenic IgA1 O-Glycoforms in IgA Nephropathy,9128230,R21DK109690,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Alkaloids', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Galactose', 'Glycosides', 'IgA1', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Region', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lectin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nose', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Sphingosine', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'aptamer', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder control', 'glycosylation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inorganic phosphate', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIDDK,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2016,251130,558628098,-0.0002823715301815373
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,9132205,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Herbal supplement', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,268344,641965656,-0.010366510657509828
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9134899,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,334212,641965656,0.0016257394267105893
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression.

"Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The uveitides are a collection of ~30 distinct diseases characterized by intraocular infection. Each disease has its own features, course, treatment, and prognosis. Traditionally, the uveitides have been grouped by the primary anatomic site of inflammation as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis. However, there are substantial limitations to this ""lumping"" of diseases. For example, among the posterior uveitides, some (e.g. toxoplasmic retinitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis) are infectious and require treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents, some are chronic, presumed immune-mediated diseases that require immunosuppression (e.g. birdshot chorioretinitis, multifocal choroiditis, serpiginous choroiditis), and a few are self-limited, spontaneously-remitting diseases with a good prognosis (e.g. acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome). As such precise diagnosis is critical for research, including epidemiology, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease specific clinical trials. Classification criteria are a type of ""diagnostic"" criteria used for reserch purposes. Although classification criteria seek to optimize sensitivity and specificity, when a trade-off is required, they emphasize specificity in order to ensure that a homogeneous group of patients is being studied. A precise phenotype is required particularly for genomic risk factor studies of complex disorders and translational pathogenesis research, as inclusion of other diseases with different risk factors and disease mechanisms would confound the results. Currently there are no widely-accepted and validated classification criteria for any of the uveitides. Preliminary data indicate ""fair to moderate"" agreement at best on the independent diagnosis of any one case by uveitis experts (κ's 0.27-0.40), but the ability of committees to reach agreement on the diagnosis of >98% of cases. The goal of the ""Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides"" project is for the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group to develop classification criteria for the 25 leading uveitides using a formal, rigorous approach. There are 4 phases to the project: 1) informatics, to develop a standardized terminology; 2) case collection, to develop a preliminary database of ~250 cases of each disease; 3) case selection, to select at least 150-200 cases of each disease that are generally accepted to be the disease (using formal consensus techniques) from the preliminary database into a final database; and 4) data analysis, using machine learning approaches, of the final database to develop a parsimonious set of criteria for each disease that minimizes misclassification. The informatics and case collection phases of the Project are complete. The case selection phase is well underway and uses online voting and consensus conference calls to achieve supermajority acceptance on all cases included in the final database. The goals of this application are to complete case selection and data analysis and develop classification criteria for the 25 of the major uveitides. These results are crucial to future clinical research i the field of uveitis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Collectively, the uveitides are the 5th leading cause of blindness in the U.S., and the cost of treating them is estimated to be similar to that of treating diabetic retinopathy. Because uveitis occurs in all age groups, including children and working-age adults, there is a greater potential for years of vision lost than with age- related diseases. Clinical research in the field of uveitis has been hampered by diagnostic imprecision and a lack of widely-accepted and validated classification criteria, the development of which is the goal of this application; these criteria are needed urgently to advance epidemiology, genomic research, translational pathogenesis research, outcomes research, and disease-specific clinical trials.            ",Developing Classification Criteria for the Uveitides,9081760,R01EY026593,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior uveitis', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Choroiditis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intermediate Uveitis', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nomenclature', 'Outcomes Research', 'Panuveitis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pigments', 'Population', 'Posterior Uveitis', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Retinitis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Uveitis', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'Voting', 'Work', 'age group', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'birdshot chorioretinitis', 'cost', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web page', 'working group']",NEI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428590,415711940,0.006361805284375505
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9067927,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,461274,47354375,-0.09264735428528015
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,9116282,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,553894,558628098,-0.007083661755977802
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,9134892,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'motor symptom', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2016,563079,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):1 Of all markers of human health, the most intuitive is body shape but based on quantitative evidence.  2 Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio  3 (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area (VAT) are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality  4 risk than body mass index (BMI). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can quantify regional adiposity in  5 more detail than the above measures but is underutilized for many reasons including potential harm from  6 ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments  7 in the ""quantified self movement"" to better describe phenotypes of body shape and its relation to metabolic  8 risks. The candidate developed in this proposal is 3D optical whole body scanning. If successful, sophisticated  9 obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with 10 disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment 11 technology. Whole body 3D imaging technology is already so accessible that it can be done with video games 12 such as the Microsoft Xbox Kinect, and consumer cameras. 13 The long term goal of the Optical Body Shape and Health Assessment Study is 1) to provide phenotype 14 descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in 15 research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive 16 models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, 17 muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat), and then show how our 3DO body composition estimates are 18 associated to important metabolic risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that 3DO measures of body 19 composition with shape classification better predict metabolic risk factors than anthropometry or DXA body 20 composition alone. Our specific aims are: 1. Identify the unique associations of body shape to body 21 composition indices in a population that represents the variance of sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity found 22 in the US population; 2. Describe the precision and accuracy of 3DO scans to monitor change in body 23 composition and metabolic health interventions; and 3. Estimate the level of association of 3DO to 24 common health indicators including metabolic risk factors by gender, race, age, and BMI. In an 25 exploratory aim, we investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct 26 predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class 27 Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self- 28 assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US 29 population, and how these models relate to important metabolic status and body composition. The positive 30 impact will be the immediate applicability to clinicians and individuals for personalized risk assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of who is at high risk of metabolic diseases because of a poor metabolic profile. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults. This is relevant to the part of NIH's mission which focuses on the prevention of disease by supporting research in the diagnosis of human diseases.            ",Optical Body Composition and Health Assessment,9082891,R01DK109008,"['Adipose tissue', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anthropometry', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Body measure procedure', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gender', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hereditary Disease', 'High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insulin Resistance', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Self Assessment', 'Shapes', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Video Games', 'Visceral', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'disorder prevention', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'insulin sensitivity', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'optical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'sex', 'subcutaneous', 'tool', 'waist circumference', 'whole body imaging']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,706716,685608202,0.011986961974121222
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy.

"Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disrupted circadian timing has emerged as a serious health and safety issue, yet there are no objective means of easily assessing circadian timing or alignment without performing a highly controlled, multiple-day in- patient study. Altered circadian timing can cause both sleep loss and sleepiness, cause performance errors such as motor vehicle accidents, and impair memory/learning. Thus, despite the obvious need to recognize an individual's circadian phase/alignment, we cannot assess circadian timing clinically or in retrospective studies. Not surprisingly, the first goal of the 2011 NIH Sleep Disorders Research Plan is to identify: ""...metabolic... biomarkers of sleep deficiency and biological timing...and circadian disorders that will facilitate personalized treatments, and clarify the risk associated with untreated sleep and circadian disorders and disturbances."" We are aware that major challenges face biomarker development, including multi-factorial causes of metabolite shifts normally controlled across multiple time-points. Because circadian time is associated with profound metabolic, immune and cardiovascular changes, however, we hypothesize that a biomarker signature for circadian phase derived from -omic markers can be obtained from a single blood sample. We therefore propose to utilize the analytical and bioinformatics platforms and experience in population-level metabolomics studies in the PIs lab to study banked plasma samples from the well-characterized individuals in six tightly controlled circadian rhythm studies run by the four co-investigators.The Aims are:  Aim 1: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and t cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics-  based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples drawn from three constant routine protocols Aim 2: To identify, to optimize, to validate, and to cross-validate a set of nested plasma lipidomics based biomarker profiles that report circadian phase and alignment using well-characterized samples  drawn from four forced desynchrony protocols  Aim 3: To systematically evaluate the validated profiles from Aims 1 and 2 and their mathematical  similarities and differences so as to improve accuracy and precision of the biomarkers  Aim 4: To test the markers identified above under poorly controlled real world applications Identification of biomarker panels will impact multiple aspects of science and health: (i) contribute to clinical recognition and treatment on circadian disorders; (ii) advance personalized medicine through individualized treatment timing to enhance efficacy/reduce side effects of medications (e.g., chemotherapy); (iii) creating epidemiologic tools to relate circadian with disease risk; and aiding development of other disease biomarkers, and; (iv) contribute to research on circadian biology and its implications for human health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to identify blood-based markers that can inform a clinician or researcher about an individual's internal biological clock. At the broad levels of society and public health research, the work has the potential direct benefit of identifying individuals with ""off-set"" clocks (enabling diagnosis and potential therapy), increasing accuracy and precision of studies of blood lipids, facilitating understanding of certain sleep disorders, increasing understanding of the role of biological clocks in chronic disease processes (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), and potentially improving the administration of certain pharmaceuticals, eg, chemotherapy agents.        ","Circadian Lipidomics in Constant Routine, Forced Desynchrony, and Non-lab Setting",9083622,R01HL132556,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Clocks', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Strigiformes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'blood lipid', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'human population study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'meetings', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'older women', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'real world application', 'tool', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2016,848973,327644200,-0.025035583257071937
"Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to investigate the potential role of fetal-maternal histocompatibility and other HLA relationships in maternal autoimmune disease. Female predominance, onset during childbearing years, and similarities to graft-versus-host disease have led to the hypothesis that natural processes during pregnancy such as the bi-directional cellular exchange between mother and fetus could be involved in the etiology of some autoimmune conditions. The presence of cells or tissues originating from a different individual is referred to as microchimerism (MC). Studies in scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have found higher number of fetal cells, or MC, in the maternal circulation years after birth compared to healthy controls. Fetal cells could potentially elicit a graft-versus-host or a host-versus-graft effect triggering autoimmune conditions. However, the overall reduction of risk of RA and SLE associated with parity and the amelioration of RA symptoms during pregnancy, suggest that exposure to fetal DNA could also be beneficial. Overall, the exact role of MC in disease etiology remains unknown. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules play a key role in immunologic function and are important in immune recognition of self and non-self. Histocompatibility relationships are hypothesized to play a role in effect and persistence of fetal cells. The overall hypothesis of this project is tha the nature of the fetal-maternal histocompatibility relationship determines the effect of exposure to fetal cells on risk of disease. This project will use 4-digit HLA genotypes, detailed pregnancy histories, and clinical characteristics abstracted from medical records from ~900 RA cases, SLE cases and healthy controls (300 in each group), 1,500 of their children and 400 fathers to address three related hypotheses. First, cases are more likely to share a larger number of alleles at eight classical HLA loci compared to controls. Case-control differences will be tested using logistic regression, adjusting for known confounders and genetic ancestry. Second, women who do not have increased histocompatibility with any of their offspring have a later age of onset of RA and SLE compared to women who have compatible offspring. Hazard ratios will be estimated using a Cox-proportional hazards model with age of diagnosis as the event of interest. Third, cases are more likely to be HLA similar to their partners than controls since feta loss is associated with increased histocompatibility between mother and child, in addition to increased risk of RA and SLE. We will first estimate the association between reported number of pregnancies resulting in fetal loss and risk of disease. Second, we will measure the degree of genetic similarity between mating partners by estimating a relatedness coefficient R. Fetal-maternal influences mediated through classical HLA genotypes could provide new insight into the etiology of these debilitating conditions and others where pregnancy related factors are suspected.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are chronic, debilitating autoimmune diseases predominately affecting women of reproductive age. Microchimerism has emerged as a potentially relevant mechanism in disease etiology where fetal-maternal HLA relationships are likely to be involved. Better characterization of the effects of fetal-maternal histocompatibility will provide new information that will aid in our understandin of disease pathogenesis, provide important predictors for disease risk and help develop better therapeutic strategies.            ",Fetal-Maternal Histocompatibility and Autoimmune Disease,8987418,F31AI116064,"['Aborted Fetus', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alleles', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Hormonal', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Live Birth', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Microchimerism', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Scleroderma', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Woman', 'abstracting', 'base', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'cell mediated immune response', 'child bearing', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'fetus cell', 'graft vs host disease', 'hazard', 'human leukocyte antigen gene', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'offspring', 'parity', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'risk variant', 'success']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,37873,148186688,-0.008758593584903445
"Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Among the most intractable pregnancy pathologies are those related to aberrant trophoblast invasion and the subsequent remodeling of maternal vasculature at the utero-placental interface (UPI). These include preeclampsia (PE), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and abnormally invasive placenta (AIP, aka placenta accreta). Despite this, tools to measure placental structure and function in the crucial late first to early second trimester period have yet to be developed that can be translated from the research environment to routine clinical use. We are now constructing 3D power Doppler ultrasound technologies that provide real-time, quantitative assessment of placental structural and vascular development. We have developed novel semi- automated methods for calculation of placental volume (PlaV) and new methods to measure gross placental morphology (GPM; dimensions, surface area etc.) and to assess the vasculature at the UPI (Fractional Moving Blood Volume, FMBV). We propose four Aims intended to move the field towards routine imaging of placental structure and function in real time and to generate clinically useful tests for monitoring significant placental pathologies. In Aim 1, using machine learning techniques and an extant database of ~2800 1st trimester placental scans, we will fully automate the novel tools developed for measurement of PlaV into a real-time analytical package. Aim 2 will focus on 3D ultrasound techniques to interrogate the vasculature at the UPI through refinement of our new method for determining FMBV, a quantitative measure of vascularity. This will lead to a tool that can assess the entire UPI, a major site of pathology in PE, IUGR and AIP. We also aim to develop 3D power Doppler ultrasound tools for the examination of the size and distribution of the spiral artery jets feeding the intervillous space, enabling us to explore normal and pathological development of the intervillous supply in real-time. Aims 3 and 4 are prospective validation studies designed to test the utility of the tools described above. Aim 3 extends our recently published study of over-invasion of the maternal vasculature to the 1 /2 trimester. The presence and severity of AIP is assessed using Acon, the largest area of standard 3D power Doppler signal at the UPI. Under-invasion will be addressed via analysis of prospectively collected 11-13 week 3D-PD scans in women who develop PE. We will compare PlaV, GPM, FMBV and spiral artery jets in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. The prospective study in Aim 4 will address the environmental impact of smoking by comparing structural and vascular parameters between smokers and non-smokers at weekly intervals from 8-18 wks. These powerful longitudinal studies will map the development of morphologic and vascular features in smokers and non-smokers and provide new insights into the factors responsible for smoking-induced growth restriction. The strong investigative team, composed of bioengineers, maternal-fetal medicine specialists and placental biologists, is delivering these new tools in the research setting and is poised to generate new methods for clinical measurement of placental structure and vascular function in real-time.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If the placenta does not develop normally, complications like poor fetal growth and preeclampsia in the mother occur. We are developing new ultrasound techniques to measure the placenta early in pregnancy. This could permit early detection of problems that occur months later in the pregnancy. This would allow doctors to monitor the pregnancy and to prevent or treat problems quickly, before they have serious effects on the fetus.        ","Development of real-time, automated 3D ultrasound tools for the study of placental invasion and morphology",9076751,U01HD087209,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decidua', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Doppler Ultrasound', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Impact', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Accreta', 'Placentation', 'Plant Roots', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Spiral Artery of the Endometrium', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Vascularization', 'Woman', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal medicine', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'insight', 'model development', 'myometrium', 'non-smoker', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'trophoblast', 'validation studies']",NICHD,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2015,45454,20704924,-0.00695994835700173
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months.

"Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will facilitate the development of the principal investigator into an independent translational researcher investigating systemic vascular injury in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This will be accomplished in the rich academic environment at the University of Pittsburgh, under the guidance of a highly accomplished team of mentors, and in the conduct of multidisciplinary research project that will develop autoimmunity as a novel mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. The increased risk of atherosclerosis in COPD is not explained by smoking, age, hypertension, and other established vascular disease risk factors. Chronic inflammation has recently been implicated as an atherogenic mechanism in COPD. We and others have reported that chronic inflammation in COPD may be propagated by humoral autoimmunity. Specifically, smokers with COPD have greatly increased levels of circulating autoantibodies that demonstrate in vitro pathogenic effects. Our subsequent studies also show that these autoantibodies target at least 50 different autoantigens and consistently target glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), particularly in patients with parenchymal lung destruction, i.e. emphysema. GRP78 is present in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the unfolded protein response, and is also a multifunction cell surface receptor. Studies in cancer patients suggest that ligation of the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 by anti-GRP78 IgG transduces pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative signals by activation of the AKT pathway, followed by NFκB activation. Additional in vivo studies have identified anti-GRP78 IgG with affinity for the C-terminus of cell surface GRP78 that produce counteracting anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing AKT activation. Our preliminary work shows that circulating anti-GRP78 IgG in COPD patients binds to macrophages and leads to increased NFκB activation and production of atherogenic inflammatory mediators by them. The macrophage is critical in the development of both atherosclerosis and COPD. Also, cross-sectional studies in our cohort find that levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG are strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema, independent of established vascular risk factors. Therefore, we hypothesize that autoimmune responses against GRP78 are a mechanism for atherosclerosis in COPD. During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that elevated levels of circulating anti-GRP78 IgG predict progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with emphysema independent of established risk factors over 4 year follow up; (2) Test the hypothesis that anti-GRP78 IgG binds to the N-terminus of cell surface GRP78 and activates the AKT pathway followed by NFκB activation and production of inflammatory mediators using a variety of cell function assays, and provide proof of concept for two potential therapeutic strategies; (3) Test the hypothesis that there are other antigen-specific immune responses associated with atherosclerosis in COPD by using machine learning to analyze high-throughput data on a large number of circulating autoantibody levels.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by smoking that kills more and more Americans each year, and is now the third leading cause of death in the US. Although it is largely viewed as a disease of the lungs, the most common cause of death in patients with COPD are blockages in blood vessels. This research project will investigate why patients with COPD are so prone to develop these blood vessel blockages.            ",Autoimmunity as a Mechanism for Atherosclerosis in COPD,8860899,K23HL126912,"['Affinity', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Responses', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carotid Artery Plaques', 'Carotid Atherosclerotic Disease', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Figs - dietary', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Immune response', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'glucose-regulated proteins', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'killings', 'macrophage', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2015,132192,570146095,-0.01815027303030487
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8849802,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,156324,507546965,-0.0028461681906160148
"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth, a leading cause of infant mortality.

"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease,8853346,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2015,186354,292134808,0.008446280490354686
"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.        ",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,8970310,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,227680,86807134,0.0035343893891735586
"Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality? ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most important clinical complications of cirrhosis. Screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients has been adopted by many providers using ultrasonography and/or serum alpha fetoprotein testing every 6 months. However, high quality data to support this practice are lacking and it is extremely unlikely that randomized trials of screening for HCC could ever be feasible in the West. We propose a case-control study to evaluate whether screening for HCC with USS or serum AFP is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. Our Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with abdominal USS is associated with reduced HCC- related mortality among cirrhotic patients.  2. Determine the extent to which screening for HCC with serum AFP testing is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality among cirrhotic patients. We will identify all Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with cirrhosis who received care in calendar year 2013 (n=60,553) in any VA facility in the country using the national VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), excluding patients for whom HCC screening is not recommended. Among these patients, we will identify those who died of HCC in 2013 and randomly select 450 cases. Each case will be matched to one control who was not diagnosed with HCC as of the date of his case's HCC diagnosis, did not later die from HCC, and who was in VA care at the time his matched case died. Matching will be performed by race, age, gender, etiology of cirrhosis and year of diagnosis of cirrhosis. Cases (N=450) and controls (N=450) will be compared with respect to presence of abdominal ultrasound or serum AFP testing performed for screening purposes within 2, 3, or 4 years prior to the diagnosis of HCC (in the cases) or the equivalent index date in their matched controls. Conditional multivariate logistic regression will be performed to adjust for additional potential confounders that may be associated with both mortality from HCC and screening for HCC including antiviral treatment for HBV or HCV, serum albumin, bilirubin, platelet count, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse or dependence, Charlson- Deyo comorbidity index, treatment by subspecialists and complexity level of medical facility. Electronic data obtained from the CDW will be supplemented by review of abstracted medical records performed by the investigators blinded as to case/control status to confirm whether USS or serum AFP testing during the period of interest was performed for screening or not and to confirm that deaths were caused by HCC in the cases. The study is powered to detect a reduction in HCC-related mortality associated with screening greater than 30% (odds ratio <0.70) if one truly exists.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HCC is the fastest growing cause of cancer related death in the USA. The proposed study represents the best methodology short of a randomized controlled trial to determine whether screening for HCC in cirrhotic patients is associated with reduced HCC-related mortality in the United States. If ""positive"" our results may lead to improved screening uptake, which is now low, and reduced HCC-related mortality, while if ""negative"", our results may reduce the costs and potential harms of screening that is of limited utility.                ",Does Screening for HCC in Cirrhotic Patients Reduce HCC-related Mortality?,8939210,R01CA196692,"['Abdomen', 'Adopted', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol dependence', 'American', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bilirubin', 'Blinded', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity Index', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Electronics', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Natural History', 'Obesity', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Preventive', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Serum', 'Serum Albumin', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'abstracting', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'case control', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'screening', 'uptake']",NCI,SEATTLE INST FOR BIOMEDICAL/CLINICAL RES,R01,2015,229312,7292939,-0.008600227359638103
"Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. CDI, which disproportionately affects older adults, can result in fulminant, life-threatening colitis and lead to multiple recurrnt episodes. There is an urgent need for validated biomarker-based clinical decision-making tools to predict which patients will experience adverse outcomes from CDI. There is a gap in knowledge regarding which known and yet to-be-discovered biomarkers, derived from the host, microbiome and pathogen, will best predict complications and recurrence. Our long-term goal is to develop and validate accurate risk-prediction models for adverse outcomes following CDI that can be used to guide therapy. The next step in pursuit of that goal, and our overall objective for the proposed research, is to discover new candidate biomarkers and determine which ones together best predict complicated CDI in an adjusted model. Our central hypothesis is that a biomarker-based model will better predict complicated CDI compared to models based on clinical variables alone. To address this hypothesis we propose three specific aims: 1) validate host biomarkers previously shown to associate with complicated CDI; 2) discover novel microbial biomarkers for complicated CDI; and 3) develop a candidate biomarker-based predictive model for complicated CDI. We will collect sera and stool prospectively in a cohort of older adults to determine if characteristics of the microbiome, microbial features of C. difficile, levels of antitoxin antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators associate with complications. Multivariable models will be constructed using linear regression and machine learning techniques and model diagnostics will be used to generate a final portable, biomarker-based predictive model for use in future studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is implicated in nearly 3 million cases of diarrhea and colitis in the U.S. each year. We currently lack a complete understanding as to why certain patients with CDI progress to severe disease with increased complications, including death, while others recover. Our research proposes to discovery objective, readily obtainable indicators from serum/stool that predict adverse outcomes from CDI early after initial disease onset. It is envisioned that this could lead to a paradigm-shift in management by directing specific treatment strategies, including more costly therapeutics such as antibody treatment, fecal transplant and newer antibiotics, towards patients who would most benefit. This research takes the first steps towards development of a biomarker-based predictive tool to aid clinicians in treatment decisions.            ",Host and Microbial Biomarkers Related to the Development of Complicated Clostridium difficile Infection,8987064,R21AI120599,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antitoxins', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Colitis', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Feces', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Loop ileostomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Serum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxin', 'Transplantation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'high risk', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'procalcitonin', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'secondary outcome', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2015,232500,641965656,-0.00019692796089637834
"Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea and mortality worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade and rivaling or exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common healthcare-associated infection in the US. A critical barrier to reducing the nosocomial spread of CDI is the delay in timely identification of CDI cases, with subsequent delays in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy and implementation of contact precautions and isolation measures to reduce horizontal CDI transmission. Despite advances in rapid laboratory-based CDI testing, there are still delays of 2-5 days between the onset of clinical symptoms and stool sampling and another 0.5-3.5 days between sample collection and actionable test results. Anticipating a delay in obtaining diagnostic results, many providers prescribe CDI antimicrobial therapy empirically, resulting in frequent and unnecessary treatment of patients who ultimately test negative for CDI. There is clearly an unmet need for diagnostic methods that can reduce this interval between onset of clinical symptoms and accurate identification of CDI. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to CDI diagnosis based on detection of the volatile metabolome of the altered CDI microbiome. C. difficile flourishes in the antibiotic- disrupted intestinal microbiome and emits a distinctive odo detectable by human and canine olfaction. In a pilot study, we assessed the volatile metabolome of stool specimens from patients with suspected CDI using analytical chemistry techniques and discerned major differences in the stool volatome of patients with and without CDI. We propose two aims executed in parallel, to test the hypothesis that the altered CDI intestinal microbiome has a unique volatile metabolite profile, distinct from the profile of patiens with other causes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which can be used to identify patients with CDI in the hospital setting. Using thermal desorption GC-MS/MS to capture and identify these trace volatile metabolites and supervised learning methods - support vector machines, prediction analysis for microarray analysis, and random forests - to analyze this high-dimensional data matrix, we will deconvolute the complex volatome of CDI, (1) identifying the characteristic volatile metabolite profile of stool samples from hospitalized patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and (2) defining the CDI volatile metabolite profile in ambient air samples from the inpatient environment of patients with CDI, compared to patients with other antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The ultimate objective of this research is to derive and validate the volatile metabolic signature of CDI in stool samples and in the patient's environment, laying the groundwork for a novel CDI assay that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the bedside identification of CDI, reducing delays in diagnosis and decreasing nosocomial transmission of this common, highly morbid, and life- threatening infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea and death worldwide, increasing dramatically in incidence and severity over the past decade. The objective of the proposed research is to identify and validate key components of the distinctive volatile metabolic 'scent' of CDI in stool and in air samples from the patient environment, laying the groundwork for a rapid bedside test for the detection of CDI. Such an assay would reduce the interval between the onset of CDI symptoms and diagnosis, allowing earlier treatment of patients with CDI, reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in patients without CDI, and decreasing healthcare-based transmission of this common, life-threatening infection.            ",Volatile Metabolite-Based Detection of Clostridium difficile Infection,8954018,R21AI119692,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Air', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diarrhea', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Exotoxins', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Gases', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Odors', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proliferating', 'Provider', 'Pseudomembranous Colitis', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Specimen', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic Megacolon', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Tube', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air sampling', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'forest', 'innovation', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,266063,327644200,-0.040761655036283546
"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is one of the world's most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) it is unclear how to acquire them in a practical way; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. The first Aim validates a universal computer algorithm that can identify HFOs automatically, then tests how to use HFO rate as method to identify where seizures will start. This method improves upon past work by improving the precision of HFO detection and determining how to avoid false predictions that would lead to unnecessary surgery. The second Aim addresses a major unsolved problem in HFO research: HFOs are seen in normal brain as well as in epilepsy. This Aim will use state-of-the- art machine learning tools to process a vast dataset of HFO collected from over 100 patients to determine how to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. The third Aim will analyze how HFOs change over time, a largely unexplored characteristic of HFOs that cannot be evaluated without very large datasets. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies identifying the location and timing of seizure onset.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.            ",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,9004826,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'data mining', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,319087,641965656,0.0016257394267105893
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particular, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8808769,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,324063,758431960,-0.048827446129353594
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8920543,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,335210,641965656,-0.010366510657509828
"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8896079,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2015,339691,558628098,-0.011399886059272682
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,415711940,-0.006263206675291092
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8925122,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,362979,117374875,-0.0020333299551710178
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,758431960,0.014345062080220022
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,47354375,-0.09264735428528015
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8896855,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,542263,558628098,-0.007083661755977802
"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8839318,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,577490,641965656,-0.012812195721415828
"Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Parkinson disease is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure - the loss of brain cells that leads to disability develops insidiously over many years, and by the time the disease is diagnosed it is already extensive and irreversible. To identify Parkinson disease years before it becomes clinically manifest, we are proposing a novel approach that will take advantage of the peripheral blood and detailed lifestyle and medical information collected from over 80,000 individuals who were followed for up to 25 years. By comparing the blood levels of hundreds of compounds between the blood of individuals who developed Parkinson disease and the blood of individuals of the same age and sex who remained healthy, we expect to make novel discoveries on the etiology of Parkinson disease and to be able to develop a method for the early identification of Parkinson disease in other populations.            ",Metabolomics and risk of Parkinson's Disease,8963132,R01NS089619,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alanine', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Caffeine', 'Cancer Prevention Study II', 'Choline', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Coffee', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Consumption', 'Controlled Study', 'Creatine', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Investigation', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Urate', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acylcarnitine', 'aging population', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer prevention', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'interest', 'men', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrition', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'tool']",NINDS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,593802,146629556,0.02487805567656414
"Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible ""natural biopsy"" of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new ""lab on a chip"" placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although the placenta is critical for fetal development and pregnancy outcome, it is not currently accessible for real-time diagnostics throughout pregnancy. Having developed tools for isolation and analysis of placenta- specific extracellular from the maternal plasma, we will study molecular and biophysical properties of these vesicles as indicators of placental health and disease.            ",Extracellular vesicles and their ncRNA cargo as markers of trophoblast injury,9019135,R01HD086325,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acoustics', 'Apoptotic', 'Arteries', 'Bathing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoglin', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetal Tissues', 'Fetus', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Glean', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nutrient', 'PGF gene', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A', 'Premature Birth', 'Production', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Research Institute', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Venipunctures', 'Vesicle', 'Viscosity', 'Woman', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'biophysical techniques', 'circular RNA', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'fetal', 'fitness', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'innovation', 'micro-total analysis system', 'nanofabrication', 'nanomechanics', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'pregnancy disorder', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'stem', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trophoblast', 'viscoelasticity', 'wasting']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2015,804679,28472699,0.004152072681071871
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8723038,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,156324,507546965,-0.0028461681906160148
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disruptd by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magneto encephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.

"Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis of Treating BV to Prevent Prematurity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth. However randomized trials of treating BV to prevent preterm birth have produced mixed results. Systematic reviews using aggregate study data found no overall benefit of treatment, but raised possibilities of benefit to women at high preterm birth risk treatd at <20 weeks' gestation. To overcome the limitations of conventional meta- analysis, we propose pooling the raw data from the trials in an individual patient data meta-analysis. Using pooled raw data, we will have greater power to evaluate the benefit of treatment of BV in subgroups of individuals and measure the days of pregnancy prolongation in treated and untreated women. Use of aggregate data does not facilitate analyses based on individual patient characteristics, such as gestational age at randomization, as is possible with individual data. In particular, we will investigate the interaction between gestational age at treatment and a priori risk of preterm birth on prolongation of pregnancy. We have commitments from 10 study PIs, representing 72% of women randomized in all the trials, to provide data and help understand variables and analyses reported from their studies. Preparing the data for analysis and harmonizing variables across studies is a major effort. Our team has extensive experience and expertise in maternal fetal medicine in general and preterm birth and BV in particular as well as database management and statistics. Missing data methods, including multiple imputation, will be employed for some variables. Logistic regression models with random effects for specific studies and interactions between treatment (drug/placebo), gestational age at randomization, and a priori risk will be fit to identify subgroups of pregnant women in whom the risk of preterm birth is reduced. Time to event (i.e., birth) models with random effects and interactions will be used to estimate the number of days of pregnancy prolongation attributable to treatment of BV in pregnant women. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the influence of single studies, inclusion of aggregate as well as individual data, and statistical models. Developments in this area have utilized Bayesian hierarchical models, which have the flexibility to incorporate data of different types. Computations will employ Monte Carlo Markov chain simulation in R and WinBugs. Statistical methods will be extended as appropriate. This project is novel in at least three ways: a unique collection of data sets and major effort to combine them, unique analyses of the impact of BV treatment on preterm birth, and unique sensitivity analyses and statistical methods. We expect to identify subgroups of women who benefit from treatment and the optimal window to initiate treatment and to have a significant positive impact on maternal and child health through screening and treatment recommendations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition, has been consistently associated with a doubled risk of preterm birth, a leading cause of infant mortality.

"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8660307,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,324364,758431960,-0.04925004015030003
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8724239,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,341074,558628098,-0.007083661755977802
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,415711940,-0.006263206675291092
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Designing an efficient Huntington's disease (HD) early intervention clinical trial for individuals who have an expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene requires identifying and combining clinical, biological, cognitive, and brain imaging markers to accurately distinguish among subjects who will have a diagnosis during a given intervention period and those who will not, and to track early changes in the disease course. The goal of this project is to identify sensitive biomarkers for HD risk stratification, indexing disease progression, and developing clinical trial endpoints. The proposal directly adheres to ""2P's"" of the NIH New Strategic Vision of the ""4P's"" of Medicine: they will offer promising ways to predict when the disease will develop; and increase the capacity to personalize early intervention based on the informative patient-specific markers our models identify. Combining biomarkers to predict HD onset and progression is an essential step in a continuum of research for development of disease-modifying therapies. Composite markers and their risk profiles created from our model will offer quantitative way to monitor and compare potential interventions. Evidence collected from these comparisons will advance the development of efficacy studies in premanifest HD, where neuroprotective treatments would be most beneficial. We develop and apply a series of cutting-edge statistical learning methods based on support vector machine (SVM), variable selection, and dimension reduction to achieve these goals. These modern statistical methods designed for correlated big data have quickly emerged as among the most successful tools for hypothesis generation, classification and prediction in biomedical studies. However, they have not been introduced to HD biomarker research. In aim 1, using counting process, we propose SVM to handle time-to-event outcomes (e.g., time-to-HD-diagnosis) to combine markers into risk scores to discriminate subjects who will experience HD onset in the immediate future from those who will not,  based on their personalized features. Although SVM is well studied for binary outcomes, it is far less explored for time-to-event outcomes. We fill this gap in knowledge. In aim 2, we propose new learning methods for longitudinal outcomes to combine markers that modify the course of HD signs to monitor disease process and distinguish subjects with rapid progression from those with slower progression. In aim 3, we propose to use novel and robust performance measures to compare derived combined markers with existing disease indices and key markers. These aims will fundamentally advance our understanding of markers linked to HD onset and progression. The creation of statistical models for composite markers and risk profiles is especially useful in: (1) offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare potential interventions, and (2) improving power of efficacy studies targeted at premanifest individuals by narrowing the predictive interval which leads to future clinical trials that can be made shorter with fewer subjects. Finally, our improved predictions of HD onset and progression will provide more informative genetic counseling sessions for pre-symptomatic subjects at risk of HD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of Huntington's disease (HD) research is to develop experimental therapeutics to delay onset or slow disease progression, and to provide different treatment regimens at each disease stage. To meet this goal, this proposal develops and applies a series of advanced statistical approaches to rank and combine clinical, behavioral, and brain imaging markers to predict HD diagnosis in premanifest subjects during a given time period and to measure disease progression. The creation of model for composite markers and risk profiles is useful in offering quantitative ways to monitor and compare interventions and powering clinical trials for premanifest HD individuals.            ",Identifying Huntington's disease markers by modern statistical learning methods.,8721037,U01NS082062,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'CAG repeat', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'affection', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'hazard', 'high risk', 'human Huntingtin protein', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2014,359539,558628098,-0.011399886059272682
"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8717634,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,371508,641965656,-0.010366510657509828
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,758431960,0.014345062080220022
"Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of cervical remodeling during pregnancy and labor is incomplete, partly due to the lack of in vivo studies on the biochemical changes that occur in the cervix over the course of pregnancy. Elucidation of the mechanisms for cervical ripening could be used to predict the onset of preterm labor. Until recently, in vivo research methods were too invasive to be used as discovery tools, particularly in women who present with preterm labor. This proposal will use in vivo Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that is sensitive to collagen content, collagen structure, hydration, lipids, proteins, ad other biomolecules to non-invasively investigate the biochemistry of the cervix throughout pregnancy. Using fiber optic in vivo Raman spectroscopy, we recently found significant differences in Raman spectra in at least four important peaks during the course of pregnancy in mice, including discrete signatures for lipids, collagen, amide bonds, and enriched amino acids (proline, tyrosine). Computational analysis of these spectra yielded predictive algorithms with 94% classification accuracy for stage of pregnancy. Studies performed in 2-hour windows at the end of pregnancy identified spectra predictive for the timing of parturition. This approach provides a detailed real-time biomolecular map of cervical ripening that is currently unavailable by other means. In this proposal, we hypothesize that the different mechanisms of premature cervical ripening have unique Raman spectral signatures that correspond to underlying biochemical and mechanical changes that precede preterm birth, which can be detected in vivo. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine spectral changes in the cervix of mice with normal and abnormal pregnancy and parturition; 2) Identify specific mediators of cervical remodeling by comparing Raman spectra to mechanical and biochemical changes in the ex vivo cervix during normal and abnormal parturition. Raman spectroscopy has primarily been used for detection of disease. Collaboration between our reproductive biology and bioengineering groups will capitalize on our expertise in Raman analysis of cervical tissues to study dynamic changes in cervix composition during pregnancy. Key elements in cervical biochemistry will be identified. In vivo Raman spectroscopy will be combined with biomechanical studies and imaging mass spectrometry, a powerful tool for in situ proteomic analysis, to examine mice with premature or delayed cervical remodeling. Together, these highly innovative approaches will generate in-depth profiles of cervical biology that will translate into novel non-invasive methods to detect impending premature birth in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will use Raman Spectroscopy, a non-invasive, optical scattering technique, to investigate the composition of the cervix throughout pregnancy and provide detailed real-time information on cervical ripening. These studies will identify spectral differences in the cervix during normal and abnormal cervical maturation; optical and biochemical markers will be identified to help monitor pregnancy non-invasively, as the fiber optic probe only requires brief contact with the external surface of the cervix to obtain measurements. Elucidating the mechanisms that initiate cervical ripening will provide a critical step for early detection and treatment of preterm birth, which is the leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.            ",Detecting biochemical changes in the pregnant mouse cervix by Raman spectroscopy,8766404,R01HD081121,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alprostadil', 'Amides', 'Amino Acids', 'Applications Grants', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Birth', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Ripening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Etiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Fiber Optics', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Hormonal', 'Hour', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Indium', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mifepristone', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proline', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RU-486', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reproductive Biology', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical application', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity/mortality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'physical science', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,387356,117374875,-0.0020333299551710178
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,47354375,-0.09264735428528015
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corpus callosum, cortical spinal tract and spinal anterior horn neurons. The disease has a uniformly fatal outcome, although the clinical presentation and course is quite heterogeneous, with median survival times between 2 - 4 years. Approximately 30,000 people in the United States are living with ALS. There is no definitive diagnostic test for ALS. Confident diagnosis is primarily based on clinical assessment and relies on the detection of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in multiple body segments, together with a history of progression of symptoms. Evaluation of LMN pathology may be supplemented by electromyography, but UMN pathology can remain occult as it is only assessed using clinical examination which can lead to diagnostic uncertainty. Unfortunately, there is on average a one- year delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis for this rapidly progressive disease; this delay prevents early treatment with emerging disease-modifying drugs. Thus, reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and disease prognostication are needed.  Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide limited and inconsistent information in ALS patients. Therefore, there has been and continues to be great interest in using advanced neuroimaging techniques to establish improved markers of the disease. Although advanced neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI) have identified differences between ALS patients and healthy controls, they lack sufficient accuracy to reliably classify individual patients. To meet this important unmet need, the proposed study will use novel advanced neuroimaging techniques to develop a multimodal biomarker of ALS, and validate a discrimination and prediction model to refine the diagnostic clinical workup for ALS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are no definitive tests for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and many of these patients have a delayed diagnosis preventing early intervention with new emerging treatments. Furthermore, disease prognosis is challenging due to the variability of the natural history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study will use multiple advanced neuroimaging methods to build a robust diagnostic test and prognostic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We will use a novel statistical approach to develop and validate the models.            ",Development of a Multi-Modal Neuroimaging Biomarker for Amyotrophic Lateral Scler,8695570,R01NS082304,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anterior', 'Anterior Horn Cells', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Electromyography', 'Evaluation', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Horns', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Motor Neurons', 'Natural History', 'Neuraxis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Riluzole', 'Spinal', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'spinal tract', 'treatment trial']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,616625,641965656,-0.012812195721415828
"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.          There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.

"Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, systemic, inflammatory disease that primarily attacks peripheral joints and surrounding tendons and ligaments. This often very painful and debilitating disease affects approximately 1.3 million Americans, of which about 70% are women. 10% of affected subjects suffer total disability. Over the last decade there have been considerable advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The use of biologic agents that antagonize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has resulted in decreased morbidity as well as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of RA patients, ranging from 20% to 50% in clinical trials, failed to mount a robust clinical response to these agents. Given the very high cost and potential serious toxicities associated with TNF antagonists, identification of predictors of the response to TNF antagonist therapy would help to optimize the clinical management of RA patients.  Novel optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods have been developed in recent years and are currently tested for various clinical application ranging from breast cancer imaging to imaging of brain activities. This novel technology promises to offer new insights into the various disease processes without the use of ionizing radiation at a relatively low cost. The group of Dr. Hielscher has recently shown that OTI is particularly sensitive to small changes in finger joints affected by RA. These changes manifest themselves in differences in the optical absorption and scattering coefficients inside these joints, which come about by changes in the optical properties of the synovial fluid as well as the vasculature surrounding the joints.  We hypothesize that optical tomographic imaging (OTI) methods will be able to detect changes occurring in arthritic joints that are treated with TNF antagonist within the first few months or even weeks of treatment initiation. Therefore, the specific aim of this revision application is to perform a longitudinal observational pilot study with 20 RA patients to identify optical imaging biomarkers that can be used to predict treatment outcome. In particular we expect that patients who respond to the treatment will show an increase in the variation of the scattering and absorption coefficient across the joint. In addition, both absorption and scattering coefficients will decreas. In patients for whom treatment response is not observed, no changes will be observed over the course of the treatment. A successful study would provide preliminary data for a more extensive grant application by a newly formed interdisciplinary team of NIAMS researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful and debilitating disease affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans. The last decade has seen the development of a new group of RA drugs called biologic response modifiers or biologics that can greatly improve the quality of life. However, not all patients respond to these new drugs and given the very high cost and potential serious side effects it is highly desirable to find biomarkers that can predict f a patient will respond to a particular drug or not. We propose to test in a clinical pilot study involving 20 RA patients, if a novel optical imaging system can be used to predict treatment outcome within a few weeks of treatment initiation.            ",Inflammation and cardiovascular disease in RA,8585677,R01AR050026,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Applications Grants', 'Arthritis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain imaging', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Optical Methods', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surgeon', 'Synovial Fluid', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'absorption', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'college', 'cost', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'healthy volunteer', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'rheumatologist', 'socioeconomics', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,147421,558628098,-0.02293803477293822
"Early CSF detection of FTLD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65. There are two main FTLD subtypes: FTLD associated with lesions immunoreactive to TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP), and FTLD associated with Tau-immunoreactive lesions (FTLD-Tau). Currently, the exact FTLD pathology cannot be confidently defined until autopsy, and there is an urgent need for ante- mortem biomarker which reliably predict FTLD pathology. Over the past 30 months, I have identified and validated a panel of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) FTLD-TDP biomarkers that identified FTLD-TDP patients with 85% accuracy, including Tau phosphorylation, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) levels, and inflammatory protein levels (FAS, eotaxin-3, IL-23), with 85% accuracy in distinguishing between the two main FTLD subtypes. The identification and validation of these CSF alterations will serve as the basis of the current proposal to translate these markers towards clinical application through multi-site technical validation and advanced classification through machine-based learning, and to better characterize altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. First, I hypothesize that we can reduce the coefficient of variation for each FTLD-TDP biomarker to under 15% through a multi-site technical validation using 60 banked CSF samples. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 by determining technical factors (freeze-thawing, blood contamination, detergent use, protease inhibitor use, buffer condition) which reduce assay precision, and validating the assay at Penn. Second, I hypothesize that machine-based learning/support vector machine approach will better diagnose FTLD-TDP by taking into account non-linear effects of age, gender, and disease duration. I will test this hypothesis in Aim 2 by comparing the classification performance between more established algorithms and the support vector machine algorithm. Lastly, I hypothesize that these biomarker changes reflect altered biochemical pathways in FTLD-TDP. I will test this hypothesis by measuring brain and CSF levels of proteins involved in Tau phosphorylation, TPP1 maturation, and inflammation. As an exploratory Sub-aim 3a, I will determine if any of the changes from Aims 1 & 3 are detectable in asymptomatic subjects carrying familial FTLD-TDP mutations, to power an R01 application on longitudinal CSF biomarker changes in prodromal FTLD-TDP subjects. I will carry out this proposal with guidance from my mentoring team including Allan Levey, MD, PhD (Emory), John Trojanowski, MD, PhD (Penn), James Lah, MD, PhD (Emory), Jonathan Glass, MD (Emory), Leslie Shaw, PhD (Penn), and Eva Lee, PhD (Georgia Tech). I will also obtain formal training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, quality control, clinical trial design, geriatrics, and responsible conduct of research. Successful completion of the aims in the current proposal will establish the standard procedures to clinically  translate promising FTLD-TDP biomarkers, determine the best algorithm to diagnose FTLD-TDP using these biomarkers, and identify altered CSF and brain pathways related to these biomarker alterations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: FTLD is the second most common cause of dementia among subjects under the age of 65, and patients and their caregivers face unique challenges including poor judgment on the job, single parents suffering from FTLD with young children, and working spouses as caregivers. There is currently no reliable way to predict the underlying FTLD subtype, and as a result it is challenging to enroll the appropriate patients for substrate-specifi clinical trials (such as drugs targeting TDP but not Tau). This proposal will establish the standardized measurements of FTLD-TDP biomarkers towards translating this research panel into clinical testing, and identify biomarker changes which can be used even when symptoms are very mild. Early and accurate FTLD- TDP diagnosis will enhance future drug development and clinical trial design to alleviate the unique personal, social, and economic burden of FTLD.",Early CSF detection of FTLD,8593988,K23AG042856,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Adult Children', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Buffers', 'Caregivers', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collection', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Detergents', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Freezing', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geriatrics', 'Glass', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Judgment', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Occupations', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Procedures', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Single Parent', 'Site', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'human CCL26 protein', 'illness length', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'interleukin-23', 'model design', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein TDP-43', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'research study', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'tau Proteins', 'tau phosphorylation', 'tau-1', 'tool', 'tripeptidyl aminopeptidase']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,156324,507546965,-0.0028461681906160148
"Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease  7. Project Summary/Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 1% of adults over age 65. While traditionally defined by motor symptoms, up to 75% of PD patients will eventually develop dementia making it the leading cause of nursing home placement in this population. Although there is currently no cure for PD, our ability to treat motor symptoms has advanced tremendously since the 1960's based on advances in our understanding of motor symptom neurophysiology. I propose that the treatment and prevention of dementia in PD may also prove possible through advances in our understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction. I will use modern network theory as a theoretical and mathematical framework for this endeavor. My long-term goal is to advance our fundamental understanding of the neurophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD to provide empirically testable models, clinically relevant biomarkers, and novel therapeutic targets. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patterns of cortical functional connectivity critical to normal cognitive function are disrupted by subcortical pathology in PD and that interventions which normalize these patterns will improve cognition. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data presented in this proposal and other previously published work. The research objectives of this proposal are to further our understanding of how cortical connectivity relates to cognitive dysfunction in PD, develop a novel biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on cortical physiology and to determine whether modulation of cortical connectivity may result in cognitive improvements in PD. We will accomplish the objectives of this proposal through three Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether graph theory measures of functional cortical activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) are associated with cognitive dysfunction in PD subjects with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI); 2) Develop a novel state-defining biomarker for cognitive dysfunction in PD based on MEG features through a machine learning approach; and 3) Determine the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on MEG measures of cortical connectivity and cognitive outcomes in PD-MCI patients. The approach is innovative because it represents the first study to apply graph theory measures to understanding the relationship of cortical physiology and cognitive dysfunction in PD; the first study to apply machine learning approaches to cognitive PD biomarker development; and the first clinical trial or mechanistic study of rTMS in PD-MCI. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction in PD and will provide biomarkers and pilot data essential to planning future therapeutic interventions. The training objectives and related research activities of this proposal will provide new skills, manuscripts and pilot data related to advanced MEG analysis, graph theory, biomarker development and rTMS trials necessary to establish my independence in these areas and obtain R01 funding to advance this unique research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dementia is the leading cause of nursing home placement in Parkinson's disease (PD) yet little is known about the cause(s) of cognitive dysfunction in PD and there are no effective treatments. Our preliminary data and other published studies suggest that abnormalities in brain activity involving networks important for normal thinking and memory may contribute to cognitive dysfunction in PD and may represent a target for treatment. This proposal will identify abnormalities in cortical activity related to cognitive dysfunction in PD usng magneto encephalography and will perform a randomized control trial of frontal repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation to determine the therapeutic potential of modulating this brain activity.            ",Intrinsic Cortical Networks and Cognitive Dysfunction in Parkinson???s Disease,8635587,K02NS080885,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cephalic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nursing Homes', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Rest', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'encephalography', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'physiologic model', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K02,2013,186354,292134808,0.008029116109903107
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.        Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.

"Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to advance understanding and research into the causes, pathogenesis, and natural history of DILI. The ongoing Retrospective study has collected 109 DNA samples from subjects with liver injury attributed to one of 8 drugs. In addition, 1215 patients with liver injuy attributed to over 100 individual drugs and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) have been enrolled and followed for at least 6 months in the ongoing DILIN Prospective study. Manuscripts describing the presenting features and clinical outcomes in the overall cohort and with DILI attributed to specific agents have been published. Ancillary studies exploring the chemical content of implicated HDS products have been initiated. The collected DNA, lymphocytes, serum, plasma, and liver tissue have also been used to conduct informative mechanistic studies. The primary aim of the current application is to continue to recruit and enroll suspected DILI patients as early as possible after liver injury onset for collection of biological samples tobe used in genetic, immunological, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. It is hypothesized that these studies will lead to improved biomarkers of DILI susceptibility, mechanisms, and outcomes. We also propose novel studies of liver elastography to longitudinally assess disease severity and a pilot clinical trial for patients with severe acute DILI. Recruiting and enrolling cases within 2 weeks of DILI onset at the University of Michigan will be accomplished via use of natural language processing algorithms to search inpatient and outpatient electronic medical records as well as the referral of patients from the 140 physician member Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network. A second aim of this application is to continue to explore the role of host genetic variation in DILI susceptibility and outcomes using next generation sequencing techniques in high causality score cases. Exome arrays, whole genome, and whole exome sequencing are proposed to identify rare genetic polymorphisms associated with DILI susceptibility followed by expression system and pathway analysis studies. The third aim of this application is to further develop an accurate and reliable computerized causality assessment instrument that will have improved sensitivity and specificity compared to expert opinion and other currently used methods. The coefficients for specific variables of this instrument will be developed from the DILIN database and tested and validated using future DILIN cases and other acute cases of non-DILI hepatitis. The fourth aim of this application is to further develop the LiverTox website as a comprehensive and authoritative resource on DILI. A LiverTox Executive Committee is proposed to oversee and coordinate the development of a computerized causality assessment instrument as well as the development and maintenance of chapters on liver injury due to prescription drugs and HDS products. Finally, a LiverTox website portal is proposed to allow for the submission of bona-fide DILI cases for causality assessment and potential enrollment into future DILIN studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Michigan Hepatotoxicity Research Network proposes to improve our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and outcomes of drug induced liver injury via the continued enrollment of adult and pediatric patients into the ongoing DILIN Prospective and Retrospective studies. The collection of early blood and urine samples from well-characterized DILI patients will allow for innovative studies of patient, drug and environmental risk factors. Further development of a computerized diagnostic instrument and expansion of the LiverTox website is also planned which will provide doctors, researchers, and the general public an authoritative and up-to-date resource that can help accelerate DILI research in the US and abroad.            ",Michigan Hepatotoxicity Clinical Research Network Renewal 2013,8627692,U01DK065184,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anabolic steroids', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Ancillary Study', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Budesonide', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exclusion', 'Expert Opinion', 'Floxacillin', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Histopathology', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Injury to Liver', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Liver', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular', 'Monograph', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Valproic Acid', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'chemical property', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'dietary supplements', 'elastography', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'isoniazid', 'liver injury', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'screening', 'transcriptomics', 'web site']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2013,321402,641965656,-0.010366510657509828
"Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the laboratory sciences have led to the discovery of a large number of candidate biomarkers, which hold great potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. At this time, an important research bottleneck is the lack of well-developed statistical methods for effectively using these candidate biomarkers to enhance clinical practice. It is our goal to develop new tools to select, combine, and evaluate biomarkers for disease classification and treatment selection. Classification markers predict an individual's disease outcome and are useful for the detection of diseases at an early stage when a treatment is most effective. Research proposed in Aim 1 seeks to select and combine markers to improve the classification performance in disease screening and diagnosis. Treatment selection markers predict a patient's response to different therapies and allow for the selection of a therapy that has the best predicted outcome. Aim 2 seeks to develop marker-based treatment selection rules to maximize the benefit to the patient population. A biomarker that is useful for guiding treatment decision to the general population will have different values to different patients due to individual differences in their response to treatment and in their tolerance of the disease harm and treatment cost. Aim 3 seeks to develop a new graphical tool to customize the evaluation of a biomarker for aiding treatment decision based on personal characteristics.  Our statistical methods will apply broadly to general medical fields. In particulr, we will apply these methods to analyze several cancer studies including (1) biomarker studies for prostate cancer and pan- creatic cancer from the Early Detection and Research Network; (2) the Women's Health Initiative breast cancer genome-wide association study; and (3) the Oncotype-Dx breast cancer study from the Southwest Oncology Group. Programs and algorithms developed in this proposal will be made available to public.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The focus of this proposal is to develop novel statistical methods for the design and analysis of biomarker studies. In particular, the proposed methods will develop marker combinations to improve disease diagnosis, develop treatment selection rules to cost-effectively reduce population disease burden, and help patients and clinicians make informed decisions about the use of medical tests in clinical practices.            ",Statistical Methods for Selection and Evaluation of Biomarkers,8483561,R01GM106177,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer genome', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,324656,758431960,-0.04925004015030003
"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,415711940,-0.006263206675291092
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,758431960,0.014345062080220022
"Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to build and test a dynamic vascular optical tomographic imaging (DVOTI) system that can be used to detect and monitor peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is estimated to affect approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. However, the disease is considerably under-diagnosed, since most patients are asymptomatic and no single reliable screening modality has been established. Most of the undiagnosed and untreated patients are diabetics. They commonly suffer from peripheral neuropathy and hence do not sense and report symptoms (such as pain) that are early signs of the disease. Consequently more than 60% (~65,000 per year) of all lower extremity amputations in the United States are performed in diabetic patients with PAD. With the number of diabetic patients expected to triple and reach almost 100 million by 2050, the problems related to undiagnosed PAD will only rise in the years to come  The most widely used diagnostic test for PAD, determination of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in conjunction with pulse-volume recordings (PVR), is known to be unreliable for diabetics. And even in non- diabetics, ABI with PVR and all other existing diagnostic tests (such as Duplex Ultrasound or Magnetic resonance angiography), only provides accurate information about proximal occlusions in major arteries of the leg. However, none of these tests assess the distal perfusion of the foot where most complications, such as ulcers and gangrene, typically occur. Monitoring the success of surgical interventions, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery, suffers from the same shortcomings, as physicians are limited to the same suite of tests that are inadequate to assess the perfusion of the foot.  Dynamic VOTI promises to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic and monitoring techniques and has the potential to initiate a paradigm shift concerning how vascular diseases are assessed. In preliminary studies we have shown that DVOTI can provide three-dimensional time-series images that provide valuable information about the perfusion of the vascular bed in feet of PAD patients. The near-infrared light used in the instrument has no adverse health effects and measurements can be repeated frequently to monitor post interventional progress. Therefore, we believe that DVOTI will prove to be a safe and accurate method to diagnose and monitor PAD in non-diabetic and diabetic patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build and test a novel optical imaging system that will allow for the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which affects approximately 8 to 12 million individuals in the United States. The disease is considerably under-diagnosed, especially in diabetic patients, the elderly, and patients with kidney disease. The system will address an unmet need to directly assess the degree of blood perfusion in the feet, where most PAD-related complications occur, which lead to over 65,000 amputations each year.            ",Optical Tomographic Imaging of Peripheral Arterial Disease,8580503,R01HL115336,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Angioplasty', 'Ankle', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Gangrene', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Angiography', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ulcer', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Vascular Diseases', 'blood perfusion', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'foot', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'light emission', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'older patient', 'optical imaging', 'post intervention', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'success', 'theories', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'vascular bed']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,469362,61807989,-0.007083661755977802
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.          The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool. We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b). Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD. We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD. This would contribute to our understanding of and aid in the development of therapies for these distinct anxiety disorders.",Pattern Analysis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in SAD,8262402,F31MH088104,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Panic Disorder', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perception', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Social Controls', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical application', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'therapy development', 'treatment response']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2012,38180,558628098,0.003071128128917446
"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Analytic Methods for Determining Multimodal Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable progress in understanding the biology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Reliable biomarkers are still lacking, however, for early stage detection of PD and for characterizing disease progression. Advances in biotechnology have led to the advent of mental health studies that collect large-scale, multi-dimensional data sets, including brain imaging data, genomic data, and biologic and clinical measures. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that stand to gain a deeper understanding of PD. A major limiting factor to multidimensional biomarker development, however, is the lack of statistical tools available to accommodate diverse, large-scale data. Leveraging data from neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) of the locus coeruleus and the substantia nigra, chemical shift imaging (CSI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, genotype information, and numerous clinical variables, we plan to develop novel statistical techniques to identify multimodal PD biomarkers. Our data provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting methodological advances in multimodal PD biomarker discovery. Separately, we will consider a massive patient database with nearly 250,000 subscribers in Georgia. Building on our collective expertise in developing statistical and machine-learning methods for large-scale imaging data and in the pathophysiology of PD, we plan to advance methods for PD biomarker analyses and discovery through the following specific aims. First, we plan to develop new statistical techniques to reveal multimodal biomarkers for PD including imaging, clinical, and biologic variables. Secondly, we plan to utilize the massive clinical database to identify clinical risk factors for early stage PD. Thirdly, we will develop software equipped with a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to implement the multimodal biomarker detection methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments. Large studies with clinical, molecular, genetic, and neuroimaging measures produce complex multidimensional datasets, which may be useful to help establish such biomarkers. We plan to develop new statistical methods that integrate multiple high-dimensional data sets to identify accurate and robust multimodal biomarkers of PD.                  There is a critical unmet need for the discovery of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarkers to assist and accelerate the process for conducting clinical trials targeting neuroprotective treatments.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.        Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor. Practice guidelines have been developed to guide physicians in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma, from surveillance in patients at high risk to treatment in those who develop this disease. This study proposes to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based surveillance and treatment recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma and their effect on survival, as well as consider patient, physician, and facility factors that may be associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of these guidelines.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".

"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,8305521,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2012,569059,685608202,-0.0023356693860943655
"Noninvasive Assessment of Neuromuscular Disease using Electrical Impedance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuromuscular disorders include a wide group of conditions ranging from relatively mild focal problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe, generalized diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Current methods for evaluating these disorders remain limited to a variety of tests and procedures that are either invasive or remarkably qualitative in nature. One newer technique, electrical impedance myography (EIM), offers the prospect of obtaining quantitative data on muscle condition painlessly and non-invasively. However, no commercial devices specifically tailored for EIM use exist, with nearly all previous EIM work relying upon off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices designed for ""whole-body"" rather than single-muscle assessment. In Phase 1 of this SBIR, Convergence Medical Devices, Inc (CMD) developed an initial prototype system to test proof-of-principle innovative concepts in circuit design and data acquisition to provide highly sensitive and accurate data at an extended frequency range (out to 10 MHz) and over multiple angles relative to the major muscle fiber direction. This work was followed by supplemental work that produced the first hand-held device with robust electronics capable of similar measurements with a detachable, interchangeable electrode array. In this 3-year Phase 2 SBIR, CMD proposes to further refine that technology so as to assist in disease diagnosis and for following disease progression, with a specific focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In Aim 1 of the proposed grant, testing of multiple electrode array designs will be performed on a group of normal subjects and those with ALS to determine which electrode array designs offer the greatest reproducibility and ability to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals. In Aim 2, the device and the 3 ""best"" array designs identified in Aim 1 will be tested in 30 ALS patients, 30 patients with syndromes mimicking ALS (e.g., polyradiculopathy and motor-predominant neuropathy), and 30 subjects with suspected/possible ALS to determine the single best array design for diagnosis and to determine its sensitivity and specificity. This study will take place at CMD and four external sites and will be managed by the Northeast ALS trials Consortium (NEALS), the premier organization for overseeing clinical trials in ALS. In Aim 3, the 30 suspected/possible ALS patients recruited in SA2 and 30 additional suspected/possible ALS patients will be assessed monthly using EIM and the 3 arrays identified in SA1. All subjects will also undergo standard measurements of disease progression including handheld dynamometry, ALS Functional Rating Scale, and spirometry. The best array design for assessing disease progression will be identified and compared to conventional markers of disease progression to determine EIM's sensitivity to disease status. Thus, at the conclusion of this research program, we anticipate having developed and vigorously tested an EIM device and associated electrode designs that together will serve as a powerful new diagnostic and monitoring tool for neuromuscular disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone. In this study, Convergence Medical Devices, in collaboration with neurologists at several medical centers, will develop and test a new device based on the concept of electrical impedance myography, a technique that offers the promise of rapid and accurate disease assessment. With the completion of this study, a new, painless tool will be developed and studied that will assist in individual patient care and will speed drug testing in clinical trials in diseases ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and muscular dystrophy to radiculopathy and polyneuropathy.              The neuromuscular disorders are a group of conditions that impact the lives of millions of people in the United States alone.

"Pattern analysis of large-scale functional connectivity to predict implicit emoti The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel neurobiological marker based on patterns of whole-brain functional connectivity during implicit and subliminal threat-related facial emotion perception to aid the diagnosis and assessment of treatment response in social anxiety (SAD) and panic disorder (PD). The following Specific Aims are proposed:    Specific Aim 1). Develop, apply and validate an approach to estimate the large-scale functional networks of implicit and subliminal threat-related and ambiguous facial emotion processing in a healthy control subject pool.    We will perform this by first testing whether large-scale partial correlations measured during a particular condition (i.e. presentation of visible or invisible fearful and neutral faces) can be used as features to predict the stimulus type presented during the condition (Sub-aim 1a). We will then test whether the most informative features for predicting fearful vs. neutral face conditions are connections among primarily limbic and paralimbic nodes, and that the most informative features in predicting neutral vs. resting states conditions are connections among primarily attention, motor and sensory related regions (Sub-aim 1b).    Specific Aim 2). Determine whether the approach developed in SA1 may have potential clinical application towards the diagnosis and treatment of SAD and PD.    We will perform this by testing whether the above functional networks are informative brain signatures that can be used to discriminate between healthy controls, SAD and PD subjects (Sub-aim 2a). We will also test whether the approach can be used to determine the particular sub-networks that are aberrant in SAD and PD (Sub-aim 2b). PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed approach may contribute toward the development of effective biomarkers in the diagnosis of SAD and PD. It may also identify the functional connections whose patterns differ between control and SAD, control and PD, and SAD and PD.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules. Electrical Impedance Scanning (EIS) has been previously investigated for non-invasive evaluation of thyroid nodules. The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose. When using REIS technology to examine the breast, we obtained initial results that are significantly better in all respects than those obtained with traditional EIS. We believe that REIS technology will similarly improve the assessment of thyroid nodules. REIS hold promise as a reproducible modality for the risk stratification of the many patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. It is a new non- invasive modality that may help reduce the number of diagnostic lobectomies and would be welcomed by patients with non-diagnostic FNA results. The purpose of this application is to design, assemble, and test in a preliminary clinical study a unique REIS based device for the assessment of thyroid nodules.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules. We will assess the ability of this technology to accurately characterize these indeterminate nodules as benign or malignant prior to a ""diagnostic"" surgery.           We propose to design, assemble, and test in technical and preliminary human studies a non-invasive, easy to use device for measuring Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) of FNA indeterminate thyroid nodules.

"Guideline-based surveillance and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Survival following diagnosis with HCC is poor unless it is detected early and stage-appropriate treatment is applied. Clinical practice guidelines outline recommendations for HCC surveillance and treatment of HCC. No study has examined the implementation or outcomes of guideline-based HCC surveillance in high risk patients or stage- appropriate treatment in patients who develop HCC. OBJECTIVES: Using data obtained from VA administrative databases combined with information abstracted from national VA electronic medical records using the VA Compensation and Pension Record Interchange application, we propose to address the following Aims: 1) to examine the implementation of guideline-based HCC surveillance in a national sample of patients with cirrhosis, and to examine patient, physician and facility factors associated with appropriate or inappropriate implementation of surveillance; 2) to evaluate the implementation of guideline-based stage-appropriate treatment among patients with HCC, and to examine patient, physician, and facility factors associated with receipt of stage-appropriate treatment; and 3) to examine the effect of guideline-based HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment on survival. METHODS: We propose a retrospective cohort study using two stratified random samples of approximately 1,500 patients with cirrhosis and 1,500 patients with HCC diagnosed during 2006-2009 in VA facilities nationwide. For Aim 1, the outcome will be appropriate (guideline-based surveillance, receipt of an imaging test unrelated to HCC surveillance, no surveillance) versus inappropriate (non-guideline based surveillance, overutilization of surveillance) implementation of HCC surveillance among patients with one of the four primary etiologies for cirrhosis (hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hepatitis B, alcoholic liver disease). Patient, physician, and facility factors associated with appropriate implementation of HCC surveillance will be examined using logistic regression. For Aim 2, the outcome will be receipt of stage-appropriate HCC treatment versus stage-inappropriate treatment or no treatment among patients with HCC. Each patient will be assigned to a stage-appropriate treatment category according to current guidelines, which will be compared against the treatment received. Logistic regression will be used to examine predictors of receiving stage-appropriate treatment. For Aim 3, the outcome will be survival among patients with cirrhosis who developed HCC. Receipt of appropriate HCC surveillance and stage-appropriate treatment will be the primary predictors of interest. Marginal structural modeling will be used to examine these associations. IMPACT: This study will examine an important and timely issue in the management of HCC that has not been examined. Findings from this study will provide a strong foundation for developing and implementing a future intervention to improve the delivery of guideline-based HCC surveillance and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma are poor.

"Hand Sensorimotor Function and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The median nerve is susceptible to compression in the wrist, leading to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common compression neuropathy and have an immense impact on national health care, worker productivity, and quality of life. Despite its high prevalence and public health cost, our understanding of CTS is limited, and the management of CTS awaits improvement. The central notion of this project is that hand sensorimotor function is sensitive to peripheral median neuropathy and that the central nervous system is affected by CTS, causing the associated sensorimotor deficit. We will investigate this notion with quantifiable sensorimotor data from novel biomechanical and neurophysiological studies. This project has three aims consisting of biomechanical, neurophysiological and translational research. The first aim is to investigate CTS-induced pathokinematic and pathokinetic performance using dexterous manual tasks of thumb opposition, reach-to-pinch, precision grip, and finger pressing. The second aim is to investigate the neurophysiological implications of chronic peripheral neuropathy (i.e., CTS) on the central nervous system by evaluating corticomuscular coupling and stretch reflex. The third aim is to identify novel biomechanical and neurophysiological markers for CTS cases using machine learning and classification algorithms. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of CTS and aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder. More generally, CTS as a chronic neuropathy serves as an effective model to study sensorimotor mechanisms of the peripheral and central nervous systems. In addition, the methodology developed in this project is applicable to other neuromuscular disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly. One of the distinct consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome is that patients experience inexplicable dropping of objects and clumsiness while performing simple daily tasks. In this project, we propose to study the sensorimotor deficit using novel biomechanical and neurophysiological experiments. The results of this project will elucidate the pathological mechanisms and manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. This project is clinically translational to aid in the development of new strategies for diagnosis, evaluation, rehabilitation, and treatment of this disorder.                   Carpal tunnel syndrome is highly prevalent and costly.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.              Public Health Relevance/",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8218308,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Screening procedure', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2011,395592,758431960,0.012974705319838261
"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,8113956,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2011,475594,685608202,-0.0023356693860943655
"A prospective analysis of peripheral blood cytokines and non-Hodgkin lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises a heterogeneous group of >30 lymphoid neoplasms, >85% of which are of B cell lineage. NHL presents a considerable public health burden with >80,500 new diagnoses and 24,600 deaths expected in 2010. The etiology of NHL is poorly understood, but it is known that overt immune compromise is a strong risk factor. Immune dysregulation may also be important in the etiology of NHL in persons with no overt immune deficiency. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detected in a sizeable minority of NHL in immune competent persons, but neither the true prevalence nor risk factors for EBV+ NHL are known. Th17, Th1, and Th2 cytokines mediate human immune responses and may be associated with NHL risk by virtue of their roles in B and T lymphocyte activation and inflammation. The Th17 response leads to the induction of several B cell stimulatory cytokines; this axis is also implicated in autoimmune disease, and persons with autoimmune conditions have an increased risk of NHL. It is plausible that Th17 dysregulation, and/or dysregulation of Th1 or Th2 or inflammatory responses, is associated with NHL risk in apparently immune competent adults. Cytokines also mediate host control of EBV and thus may also predict risk of EBV+ NHL. To examine these hypotheses, we will conduct prospective studies nested within the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study cohorts. In a projected pooled sample of 670 cases and 1340 matched controls, we will measure a panel of immune markers in pre-diagnostic plasma samples. We will collect tissue specimens from NHL cases for pathologic studies to determine WHO-defined histologic subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) molecular subtype, and EBV status. We will use conditional logistic regression to assess the association of plasma immune markers indicative of altered Th17, Th1, Th2 and/or inflammatory responses with NHL. We will evaluate confounding by other NHL risk factors and conduct secondary analyses to examine effect modification and explore the correlation of plasma immune markers with those other factors. With these studies we will be the first to examine the etiologic role of the Th17 response in NHL, to report population-based prevalences of EBV+ NHL by subtype and of DLBCL subtypes, and to prospectively evaluate risk factors for EBV+ NHL. The multidisciplinary study team features epidemiologists (Drs. Birmann, Laden, and Giovannucci), a senior biostatistician (Dr. Rosner), and immunologists (Drs. Martmnez-Maza and Breen) and hematopathologists (Drs. Aster and Rodig) with substantial relevant experience-i.e, in the use of plasma immune markers in etiologic studies, prospective data analysis, and the pathologic determination of NHL histologic type and tumor EBV status. With this highly qualified team, the extraordinary resources of the cohorts, and the proposed studies, we are uniquely situated to contribute novel insights on the role of immune dysregulation in the etiology of NHL and EBV+ NHL in immunocompetent adults.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 6th most common cancer diagnosis in the US and is sometimes associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The studies proposed in this application involve testing blood samples for levels of cytokines, which are hormones that drive immune responses, to evaluate whether risk of different types of NHL or EBV-associated NHL is related to cytokine imbalances in apparently healthy persons. The findings may be useful for identifying people at a higher risk for these cancers, the causes of which remain poorly understood.             Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 6th most common cancer diagnosis in the US and is sometimes associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.

"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease.

"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7805478,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'global health', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'relational database', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2010,339537,12471676,0.015938923255524068
"Accessible Handling of Misclassified or Missing Binary Variables in CER Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common but often overlooked threats to the validity of comparative effectiveness research (CER) studies include the misclassification or missingness of binary variables that are crucial to the ultimate analysis of the data. These variables potentially include the outcome of interest in standard or repeated measures logistic regression models, the factor (exposure) of interest, or an important confounder of the association under study. This proposal seeks to facilitate the investigation of the resulting biases to which a given CER analysis may be subject, and to provide study design-based remedial measures via which validity can be restored. The focus is upon statistical methods for conducting sensitivity analyses, as well as methods designed to make efficient use of supplemental data sources. The latter include validation data (in the case of misclassification), and so-called reassessment data (in the case of potentially informative missingness). A primary consideration throughout includes the incorporation of subject-specific covariates into the model of interest, as well as into models for the underlying misclassification or missingness process. Another primary goal is to establish a relatively consistent likelihood-based framework for all proposed analyses incorporating supplemental data, and to provide user-friendly programs utilizing common statistical software in order to make the methods broadly and readily accessible to those conducting CER. While not limited to specific applications, the proposed research draws motivation from and lends itself to illustration via two real-world studies. The first is the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS), an observational cohort study in which the binary diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made at repeated visits via both error-prone and sophisticated assay techniques. The second is an emergency department-based ophthalmologic study in which non-dilated ocular fundus photography will be used for diagnosing serious ocular conditions, and will be compared against existing standard diagnostic methods. Both studies involve internal validation data to facilitate corrections for misclassification based on a fallible diagnostic method, and both are also subject to missing outcome and/or predictor data.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis. The problems upon which the project focuses come about when binary (""yes/no"") data are subject to being incorrectly measured (misclassified), or when they are sometimes not observed (missing) for reasons that might relate to information about subjects in the study. The intention is to provide CER investigators with methods that are relatively easy to use, yet effective and powerful for combating these challenges to valid data analysis.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to provide statistical methods to aid comparative effectiveness research (CER) investigators with common problems encountered in data analysis.

"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7904787,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,489910,685608202,-0.0023356693860943655
"FT-IR Microscopy of Mineral Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is responsible for approximately 1.5 million fractures in the US per year, with 300,000 of these fractures occurring at the hip at a cost exceeding $17 billion. The NIH Consensus conference and the World Health Organization defined osteoporosis as ""...compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture"". A variety of genetic and environmental factors, as well as bone properties (geometric and material), contribute to the bone loss that is associated with osteoporosis, but the question remains as to which factors primarily contribute to fracture risk. While reduced bone mineral density (BMD) relative to young individuals is routinely used clinically to predict fracture risk, BMD is not a strong predictor, with the majority of fractures occurring in patients with BMD's above the osteoporotic threshold. We have recently shown by multiple logistic regression analysis that specific mineral and matrix properties assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic imaging (FTIRI) are predictive of fracture in postmenopausal women, while BMD is not significantly associated with fracture incidence. In a limited number of samples we have also shown that these FTIR parameters are correlated with nanomechanical properties. We hypothesize that variation in crystallinity (XST) and collagen maturity (XLR) partially explains the difference in incidence of fractures in individuals with similar BMDs. We further hypothesize that heterogeneity in these parameters is an additional determinant of fracture incidence, especially in trabecular bone. In the proposed studies we will test 4 hypotheses. 1) For any subject, FTIRI data obtained in the cortical and cancellous bone of the iliac crest (generally a non-fracturing site) is representative of that from sites that fracture (subtrochanter/greater trochanter). Further, the data are independent of the size of the biopsy as long as cortical and cancellous bone areas are included. This will be tested using multiple biopsies from cadavers and from clinic patients with fractures. Measures will include micro-CT analysis of BMD and architecture, and FTIRI. 2) Decreased heterogeneity in FTIRI mineral and matrix properties, in addition to increased XST and XLR, are predictive of fracture in humans. This will be tested by extending our logistic regression to heterogeneity parameters. Variation in tissue properties with age will be studied in patients with idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Tissue mechanical properties will be correlated with FTIRI data. 3) An anabolic agent (PTH) can restore mechanical properties, and the XST, XLR, and mineral and matrix heterogeneity in animal models as well as in osteoporotic humans. This will be tested by analyses of pre- and post- treatment human biopsies and by analyses in a sheep model. 4) XLR, which is altered in osteoporosis, is related to collagen orientation. As part of our continued parameter validation, this will be tested by comparing FTIRI and second harmonic heneration microscopy data. Testing of these four hypotheses will provide new insights into the efficacy of therapies and contribute to the understanding of factors leading to fracture.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life. Correlations are sought between spatial variation in parameters obtained by vibrational spectroscopy and mechanical properties. This information should lead to improved diagnosis and new approaches to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the ""silent epidemic"".              The objective of this continuing investigation is to discover what changes in bone properties cause a bone in a person with osteoporosis to break; we have suggestive evidence that changes in the structure and composition of the bone composite (mineral and matrix) put bones at risk of breaking during normal activities of daily life.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7846704,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'base', 'blind', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein profiling', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2009,19341,338121506,-0.0899913424021051
"Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Between 2001-2003 there were 11.6 million annual ambulatory care visits for skin and soft tissue infections, with a 31% increase in emergency department visits compared to the previous decade, according to the National Hospital AmbulatoryMedical Care Survey data. The majority of these infections are caused by community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and most CA-MRSA infections are manifested as skin and soft tissue infections. As the prevalence of CA-MRSA continues to increase worldwide each year, with community outbreaks observed in multiple settings, it is not surprising that more and more hospitals are being affected by this surge in patient visits. Pediatric and general emergency departments are often the first line for diagnosis and treatment of these infections which may include a painful drainage procedure. A history and physical examination by a health care provider has thus far been the standard of care in diagnosing skin and soft tissue infections. At times inaccurate, the clinical exam can lead to misdiagnosing (either over or underestimating) a lesion that requires drainage. Emergency ultrasound (EUS) is a commonly used tool in general emergency departments for various diagnosis and treatments including the diagnosis of drainable soft tissue infections. The utility of EUS as an adjunct to the clinical examination in pediatric patients for soft tissue infections is unknown. The primary objective of this study is to determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination alone with that of the exam plus EUS in children. This will be done through a cross-sectional study design conducted in a large, urban, tertiary-care pediatric emergency department. Children with suggestion of soft tissue infection will be prospectively enrolled. Physicians are trained in bedside emergency ultrasound for evaluation of soft tissue infections prior to patient enrollment. The reference standard is the presence of a soft tissue infection requiring drainage defined as purulent material expressed if a drainage procedure is performed, or if no drainage is performed, the need for a drainage procedure or spontaneous drainage within two days of the initial visit. Sample size calculations are based upon a hypothesized change in sensitivity of at least 9% with the addition of EUS. Statistical analysis will include calculation of test characteristics, conditional logistic regression with model building, and derivation of ROC curves. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The rise in visits for soft tissue infections is an important public health issue today. Emergency bedside ultrasound in children may offer improvement in the diagnosis of these infections, and therefore, ultimately may result in more rapid and appropriate treatment, with improved patient outcomes.                 n/a",Bedside emergency ultrasound for the evaluation of soft tissue infections,7674987,F32AI080063,"['4 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drainage procedure', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Design', 'Sample Size', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Soft Tissue Infections', 'Specificity', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Visit', 'base', 'improved', 'methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'tertiary care', 'tool']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,F32,2009,61611,178185562,-0.014896667267095591
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups.

"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7648231,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2009,221910,340417756,-0.019065017785591498
"Predictors of Hospital-Acquired Urinary Tract-Related Bloodstream Infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive efforts to reduce urinary tract-related bloodstream infection are hampered by the scarcity of analytic studies that identify etiologic factors, particularly those specific to the time-dependent elements that may impact prognosis during hospitalization. Therefore, the ability of clinicians to intercede in a meaningful way has been restricted. The objective of this study is to delineate both host- and time-dependent factors that contribute to urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. This study is unique in that it will ascertain potential causal mechanisms of bloodstream infection taking into account the time course of a hospitalized patient's stay and the multiple procedures and treatments that occur during this stay. Specific Aim #1 addresses the relation between obesity, diabetes, and urosepsis. Specific Aim #2 is directed to time-related procedural and treatment factors that impact the incidence of infection. Of particular interest are the use of catheterization, ultrasound detection of urinary retention, antibiotics, immunosuppressant therapies, statin use, and allogeneic blood transfusions. A nested case-control study is planned that will include adult patients from the University of Michigan Health System. Incidence density sampling will be utilized for random selection of controls. Information from cases and controls will be extracted from multiple electronic databases (electronic medical, pharmacy, and laboratory records) over a 5-year period to yield 640 subjects. Analyses will identify factors related to the development of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. Conditional logistic regression with clustering by ward will be utilized for the analyses, as well as sliding time windows for log-linear models and cubic B-splines with time-specific weight functions. We anticipate that the information obtained from the proposed study   which evaluates novel risk factors and is responsive to program announcement PA-06-151 by utilizing secondary data   will enhance tools for clinical decision making and provide a framework for preventive trials. Urinary tract infection is the most frequent healthcare-associated infection and, when disseminated to the bloodstream, can be fatal. The mortality rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection varies from 5% to 33% in different cohorts and is considerably higher in elderly patients. We anticipate that the information obtained from this study will form the foundation for the development of screening tests to identify patients at risk of infection at specific points in time during hospitalization and for planning preventive intervention trials.

"Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) has doubled in the United States over the past two decades. Hepatitis C is the major risk factor for HCC with approximately 3 million individuals currently infected nationwide. Survival following HCC diagnosis is dismal except where potentially curative therapy (resection, transplant, local ablation) is applied. HCC surveillance is aimed at applying abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosing HCC at an early stage when patients are most likely to be eligible for potentially curative therapy. One randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have indicated that HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved survival. Practice guidelines have recommended HCC surveillance for patients with hepatitis C at high risk of developing HCC. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the extent of prevalence, patterns, and determinants of HCC surveillance. AIMS: (i) To examine the patterns (prevalence, type, and frequency) of utilization of HCC surveillance in veterans infected with hepatitis C; (2) To examine patient-, facility provider-, and physician provider- determinants of HCC surveillance among veterans infected with hepatitis C; and (3) To examine the effect of HCC surveillance on the receipt of HCC potentially curative therapy and survival among veterans infected with hepatitis C, and to identify surveillance strategies associated with best outcomes. METHODS: We propose to conduct i) a retrospective cohort study of more than 150,000 patients infected with hepatitis C and 39,000 high-risk patients identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Registry, 2) a survey of more than 128 provider facilities to supplement information in the registry, and 3) a survey of physician providers to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards HCC surveillance. Surveillance tests will be identified in the registry based on a previously developed algorithm using data from administrative files. Patient-, tumor-, and facility determinants of HCC surveillance will be identifed from the Hepatitis C Registry and supplemented by the facility survey. Additionally, we will examine the association between surveillance and receipt of resection, transplant, or local ablation as well as survival. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to examine these outcomes. IMPACT: This study will examine a previously unaddressed subject pertaining to a highly fatal cancer that thus far has received little attention. It will provide information on the effectiveness of HCC screening as reflected by the extent of use as well as outcomes. Evaluating the extent and patterns of HCC surveillance is crucial in understanding diffusion (and obstacles) of this practice and in designing interventions to improve the implementation of HCC surveillance.           n/a",Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans,7686310,R01CA125487,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'programs', 'surveillance strategy', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,291650,323604360,-0.0051984075890999185
"Genetics of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and Subtypes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune arthropathy characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues. It is a debilitating disorder in which progressive joint damage and resulting growth disorders may occur. It is the most common chronic childhood rheumatic disease in the Western world. There are at least seven subtypes that comprise JIA and these subtypes clearly differ by age of onset and gender. JIA has a strong genetic influence with sibling risk ratios of approximately 20 (S=20). However, genetic influences vary by subtypes, age of onset and gender. We propose to analyze existing genome-wide association (GWA) data on 800 JIA cases and greater than 3,000 controls of European ancestry and genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K and Affymetrix 6.0 platforms for targeted hypotheses beyond the current case:control study. We hypothesize that loci contributing to the risk of JIA can be identified through contrasting and partitioning into more homogeneous subtypes of JIA and testing for the modifying effects on these loci's risks through interactions with HLA polymorphisms, age of onset and gender. We propose to identify genetic factors of JIA via 1) the use of imputation methods to test for association with JIA and subtypes for all HapMap SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than 2%; 2) computing GWA analysis for age of onset, SNP-by-gender interaction, SNP-by-HLA interaction and SNP-by-SNP interactions; 3) identifying regions of loss of heterozygosity and copy number variation predictive of JIA and its subtypes; and 4) computing GWA for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in individuals with both Affymetrix 6.0 and existing global gene expression data. The proposal includes well powered GWA analyses for JIA, novel methods such as statistical machine learning for interaction analyses, and integration of expression and genotype data. The proposed series of analyses will assist in our long- term goal of understanding JIA, while recognizing the diversity of conditions known as JIA and making the discoveries of greater relevance for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a childhood onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of joints and other tissues.

The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7612766,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health research', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2009,342967,12471676,0.015938923255524068
"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7682995,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'meetings', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,493771,685608202,-0.0023356693860943655
"Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of a Research-Ready Pregnancy and Newborn Biobank in California Population-based biobanks are a critical resource for identifying disease mechanisms and developing screening tests for biomarkers associated with certain disorders. The California Department of Public Health has been banking newborn specimens statewide since 1982 (N~14 million) and maternal prenatal specimens for a portion of the state since 2000 (N~1 million), creating one of the largest, if not the largest single biological specimen banks with linked data in the world. With the fast pace of new knowledge in genetics and laboratory methods, the demand for specimens and data from researchers around the world now far surpasses the Department's ability to fill them. The goal of this infrastructure development project is to create an efficient, high throughput, low cost newborn screening and prenatal/maternal screening specimen biobank and linked data base that could be used by large numbers of researchers around the world for a wide range of studies through the following aims: (1) establishment of highly efficient protocols and procurement and integration of automated systems for pulling and processing specimens; (2) development of an integrated specimen tracking system into the Department's existing web-based Screening Information System; (3) development of a computerized system to track application requests for specimens and data; and (4) development of a linked screening program-vital records database that is organized into a life course, client based system. These aims will be accomplished through expansion of the Department's award-winning Screening Integration System to include web-based tracking of specimens and research requests, and use of an innovative machine-learning record matching application for high-performance linkages. After the 2 year grant period is completed, the California Research Ready Biospecimen Bank will be able to provide researchers with valuable biological specimens in a timely, cost-effective manner, thereby enabling a dramatic expansion of epidemiological research nationwide. The continuity of the system will be ensured by codifying human subjects-sensitive policies and procedures into Departmental regulations and by charging researchers modest fees for specimens, data and other research services.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a research-ready pregnancy and newborn biobank in California This proposal funds infrastructure development to create a research-ready, efficient, high- throughput, and low-cost prenatal and newborn biobank in California.

"Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in nursing home residents. To date, criteria for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of UTI in nursing home residents have been derived by consensus rather than empirical data. Lack of criteria from empirical evidence leaves nursing home practitioners with the common clinical dilemma of deciding whether nonspecific clinical changes (e.g., fever, altered mental status) are attributable to UTI and whether treatment will benefit clinical outcome. A key step to identifying who should receive antibiotics is to empirically determine diagnostic criteria, including both clinical and laboratory features. The long-term OBJECTIVE of this line of investigation is to identify the subset of nursing home residents with laboratory evidence of UTI (i.e., bacteriuria plus pyuria) in which antibiotic therapy reduces adverse outcomes (i.e., bacteremia, functional decline, death). The SPECIFIC AIM of this proposed research is to identify clinical features that are associated with laboratory evidence of UTI (bacteriuria [>100,000 colony forming units on urine culture] plus pyuria [>10 white blood cells on urinalysis]). Our a priori HYPOTHESIS is that specific clinical features (i.e., change in mental status, fever, change in voiding pattern) will be associated with laboratory evidence of UTI. This observational cohort study will be conducted at five New Haven area nursing homes with a sample size estimate of 493 residents. Persons aged 65 years or older will undergo baseline assessment upon enrollment and repeat assessment when suspected of having UTI. A logistic regression model will be used to determine bivariate and multivariable associations between clinical features and laboratory evidence of UTI. A ROC curve will be calculated from the final multivariable logistic regression model. Those clinical features independently associated with laboratory evidence of UTI will be combined with bacteriuria and pyuria to create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Identifying clinically relevant UTI in nursing home residents is a common dilemma with important functional, economic, and infection control implications. This study will create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Future studies will identify residents with UTI in whom antibiotic therapy improves clinical outcome.           n/a",Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI,7364613,R03AG028057,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic-resistant organism', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriuria', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colony-forming units', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysuria', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Leukocytes', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Pyuria', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Hypertension', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary tract', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'mortality', 'young adult']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,66431,550947887,-0.003929363298129244
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,50343425,-0.03449939449699614
"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7388981,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2008,124583,415711940,-0.02388634385581609
"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7501971,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,136830,338121506,-0.0899913424021051
"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7434510,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2008,181300,55098220,-0.003084282486883892
"Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Fifteen to 50% of patients die from complications related to the procedure. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 20-80% of transplant recipients and is the major cause of post transplant non-relapse mortality. While some clinical parameters (e.g. age, donor: recipient histocompatibility) can predict GVHD, no biological factors have been identified that reliably predict the incidence and severity of GVHD and its associated mortality, as well as allow an understanding of the underlying pathogenesis of the disease, which, in turn could inform innovative treatment approaches. Hence, there exists a critical need to identify reliable biomarkers for the disease. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in genes regulating biological pathways of GVHD are associated with GVHD and transplant related mortality (TRM). We propose a candidate gene approach to analyze, in 838 subjects (donors and recipients), the relationship of 427 genetic polymorphisms which may modulate the immune response, inflammatory amplification and the metabolism of therapeutic agents with the incidence and course of GVHD and transplant related mortality. We will use conventional multiple variable regression analysis to identify relevant polymorphisms and will test novel machine based learning and graph based algorithms to identify gene patterns or interactions not recognizable with usual statistical techniques. Reliable genetic biomarkers would permit identification of high risk patients who need more effective prophylaxis or preemptive screening or therapeutic interventions to limit the severity of their graft versus host disease and ultimately to improve survival. Validation of our findings in a subsequent multicenter cohort could provide important data useful to inform the management of allograft patients and improve their outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Graft-versus-host disease is a devastating disease that affects 20-70% of blood and marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. The disease is caused by an immune attack by donor cells on patient tissue. Some genetic factors, including polymorphisms (changes in amino acids in genes that alter their function) may predict patients at high risk of these complications. We aim to identify patients at high risk of complications and death, and subsequently modify their treatment, using the information we learn from our genetic studies, to alter their course. Our long term goal is to improve survival in these patients by determining groups at high risk towards whom intensive therapy should be targeted.          n/a",Identification and Development of Genetic Polymorphisms as Biomarkers of Graft ve,7509654,R21AI079354,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Graft Versus Host Disease', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Transplants', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cytokine Gene', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histocompatibility', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marrow', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Rare Diseases', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug metabolism', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'graft vs host disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2008,188750,340417756,-0.019065017785591498
"Predictors of Hospital-Acquired Urinary Tract-Related Bloodstream Infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preventive efforts to reduce urinary tract-related bloodstream infection are hampered by the scarcity of analytic studies that identify etiologic factors, particularly those specific to the time-dependent elements that may impact prognosis during hospitalization. Therefore, the ability of clinicians to intercede in a meaningful way has been restricted. The objective of this study is to delineate both host- and time-dependent factors that contribute to urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. This study is unique in that it will ascertain potential causal mechanisms of bloodstream infection taking into account the time course of a hospitalized patient's stay and the multiple procedures and treatments that occur during this stay. Specific Aim #1 addresses the relation between obesity, diabetes, and urosepsis. Specific Aim #2 is directed to time-related procedural and treatment factors that impact the incidence of infection. Of particular interest are the use of catheterization, ultrasound detection of urinary retention, antibiotics, immunosuppressant therapies, statin use, and allogeneic blood transfusions. A nested case-control study is planned that will include adult patients from the University of Michigan Health System. Incidence density sampling will be utilized for random selection of controls. Information from cases and controls will be extracted from multiple electronic databases (electronic medical, pharmacy, and laboratory records) over a 5-year period to yield 640 subjects. Analyses will identify factors related to the development of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. Conditional logistic regression with clustering by ward will be utilized for the analyses, as well as sliding time windows for log-linear models and cubic B-splines with time-specific weight functions. We anticipate that the information obtained from the proposed study   which evaluates novel risk factors and is responsive to program announcement PA-06-151 by utilizing secondary data   will enhance tools for clinical decision making and provide a framework for preventive trials. Urinary tract infection is the most frequent healthcare-associated infection and, when disseminated to the bloodstream, can be fatal. The mortality rate of urinary tract-related bloodstream infection varies from 5% to 33% in different cohorts and is considerably higher in elderly patients. We anticipate that the information obtained from this study will form the foundation for the development of screening tests to identify patients at risk of infection at specific points in time during hospitalization and for planning preventive intervention trials.

"Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) has doubled in the United States over the past two decades. Hepatitis C is the major risk factor for HCC with approximately 3 million individuals currently infected nationwide. Survival following HCC diagnosis is dismal except where potentially curative therapy (resection, transplant, local ablation) is applied. HCC surveillance is aimed at applying abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosing HCC at an early stage when patients are most likely to be eligible for potentially curative therapy. One randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have indicated that HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved survival. Practice guidelines have recommended HCC surveillance for patients with hepatitis C at high risk of developing HCC. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the extent of prevalence, patterns, and determinants of HCC surveillance. AIMS: (i) To examine the patterns (prevalence, type, and frequency) of utilization of HCC surveillance in veterans infected with hepatitis C; (2) To examine patient-, facility provider-, and physician provider- determinants of HCC surveillance among veterans infected with hepatitis C; and (3) To examine the effect of HCC surveillance on the receipt of HCC potentially curative therapy and survival among veterans infected with hepatitis C, and to identify surveillance strategies associated with best outcomes. METHODS: We propose to conduct i) a retrospective cohort study of more than 150,000 patients infected with hepatitis C and 39,000 high-risk patients identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Registry, 2) a survey of more than 128 provider facilities to supplement information in the registry, and 3) a survey of physician providers to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards HCC surveillance. Surveillance tests will be identified in the registry based on a previously developed algorithm using data from administrative files. Patient-, tumor-, and facility determinants of HCC surveillance will be identifed from the Hepatitis C Registry and supplemented by the facility survey. Additionally, we will examine the association between surveillance and receipt of resection, transplant, or local ablation as well as survival. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to examine these outcomes. IMPACT: This study will examine a previously unaddressed subject pertaining to a highly fatal cancer that thus far has received little attention. It will provide information on the effectiveness of HCC screening as reflected by the extent of use as well as outcomes. Evaluating the extent and patterns of HCC surveillance is crucial in understanding diffusion (and obstacles) of this practice and in designing interventions to improve the implementation of HCC surveillance.           n/a",Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans,7496940,R01CA125487,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2008,291650,323604360,-0.0051984075890999185
"Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The principal objective of this project is to develop methods that combine pathogen genotyping and patient epidemiology data that can be used in the control, understanding, and tracking of infectious diseases. This work focuses on the modeling of large international collections of patient epidemiology and strain data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), the causative agent of tuberculosis disease (TB), because of the urgent global need and the unique data availability due to the National TB genotyping program. Specifically, the project addresses the following problem: given MTC DNA fingerprinting and TB patient data being accumulated nationally and internationally, identify hidden groups capturing MTC genetic families and TB epidemiology using machine learning, and use these hidden groups to address problems in the control, understanding, prevention, and treatment of tuberculosis at city, state, national, and international levels. To address this objective, we identify several aims. The first aim is to gather and merge large databases of MTC patient-isolate genotypes as well as associated patient information from the New York City, New York State, United States, and the rest of the world. The second aim is to identify MTC strain families based on multiple genotype methods using graphical models constrained to reflect background knowledge. The third aim is to identify hidden host-pathogen groups within TB patient demographics and MTC genotypes using a combination of probabilistic graphical models and deterministic multi-way tensor analysis methods designed to capture the temporal dynamics of TB. The fourth aim answers public health questions posed by TB experts by transforming the questions into quantifiable metrics applied to the hidden groups. The hidden group models and metrics will be embedded in analysis methods, and then evaluated by TB experts. The proposed models and analysis methods will capture and share knowledge embedded in large TB patient and MTC genotyping databases without necessarily sharing the actual data.          n/a",Discovering hidden groups across tuberculosis patient and pathogen genotype data,7354450,R01LM009731,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Boxing', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemiology', 'Epidemiology, Other', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Gender', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guadeloupe', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nature', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogeny', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Restriction fragment length polymorphism', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'demographics', 'design', 'disorder control', 'family genetics', 'fight against', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mycobacterial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'prototype', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'transposon/insertion element', 'trend', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NLM,RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE,R01,2008,342967,12471676,0.015938923255524068
"Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human prion diseases, such as Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (CJD), are difficult to diagnose and are of increasing public health concern due to the risk of transmission. Our dementia program is a major referral center for prion diseases in the United States with 952 potential CJD referrals over the past six years. We also are conducting the first ever US sporadic CJD (sCJD) treatment trial, sponsored by the NIH. Unfortunately, many cases of sCJD are misdiagnosed or are diagnosed too late in the course for any future potential treatment to be effective. We, and others, have shown that brain MRI has very high sensitivity and specificity for sCJD diagnosis. Unfortunately, the most widely used diagnostic criteria for sCJD, Revised 1998 WHO Criteria, are problematic for several reasons: 1. they require symptoms that often do not occur until late in the disease course; 2. they do not use MRI; 3. they use a surrogate biomarker in the spinal fluid, the 14-3-3 protein, which we have found lacks sensitivity and specificity; and 4. they rely on certain electroencephalography (EEG) findings that have low sensitivity, particularly earlier in the disease. We will prospectively evaluate 100 patients with sCJD, 20 patients with symptomatic gCJD, and 40 patients with asymptomatic (presymptomatic gCJD) and 80 with other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPDs) over five years. We will conduct comprehensive assessments, including clinical, behavioral, spinal fluid surrogate marker, EEG, and MRI analyses. We will evaluate our gCJD at an age close to their predicted age of onset which will help us to identify the earliest signs of prion disease. A major focus will be to identify specific regions and patterns of abnormality on FLAIR and DTI MRI that can differentiate sCJD from other RPDs. Through this prospectively acquired data, we will devise a state of the art diagnostic scheme, using contemporary statistical classification techniques and logistic regression, for early diagnosis of sCJD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal, transmissible neurodegenerative diseases. At least one form can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and prions have now been found in several other tissues outside of the nervous system, including muscle, lymphoreticular tissues, and olfactory epithelia. Through earlier diagnosis, patients may be spared unnecessary and time-consuming diagnostic procedures and have better chance of responding to potential treatments, and the risk of transmission can be greatly reduced.          n/a",Early Diagnosis of Human Prion Disease,7526427,R01AG031189,"['Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Invasive', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Numbers', 'Olfactory Epithelium', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'cohort', 'experience', 'forest', 'improved', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'tertiary care', 'transmission process', 'treatment program', 'treatment trial']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,498510,685608202,-0.0023356693860943655
"Systems analysis of oxygen regulation in Halobacterium    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To withstand environmental onslaught, biological systems mount global programs to coordinate the induction of protection and repair mechanisms. This proposal poses the hypothesis that the transcriptional networks underlying such responses to diverse stressors are interrelated. Halobacterium, a halophilic archaeon, has been chosen as a model for this study because it routinely negotiates an array of adverse conditions in its extreme environment, including anoxia, metal stress, and radiation damage. This proposal will investigate the inter-relationship of these responses using global approaches. Given that basal genetic information processing pathways in Halobacterium are mediated by eukaryotic-like proteins, findings from this study will have a direct impact on understanding how complex eukaryotic organisms elicit orthogonal responses in disease-perturbed or infection states. Specifically, I will (1) Characterize key transcriptional regulators responsible for mediating responses to fluctuating oxygen concentrations and identify regulons under their direct and indirect control; (2) Through statistical analysis of integrated datasets, evaluate the extent of cross-regulation of the anoxic response with other environmental perturbations; (3) Experimentally test new hypotheses generated by statistical analysis.

"Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common indication for prescribing antibiotics in nursing home residents. To date, criteria for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of UTI in nursing home residents have been derived by consensus rather than empirical data. Lack of criteria from empirical evidence leaves nursing home practitioners with the common clinical dilemma of deciding whether nonspecific clinical changes (e.g., fever, altered mental status) are attributable to UTI and whether treatment will benefit clinical outcome. A key step to identifying who should receive antibiotics is to empirically determine diagnostic criteria, including both clinical and laboratory features. The long-term OBJECTIVE of this line of investigation is to identify the subset of nursing home residents with laboratory evidence of UTI (i.e., bacteriuria plus pyuria) in which antibiotic therapy reduces adverse outcomes (i.e., bacteremia, functional decline, death). The SPECIFIC AIM of this proposed research is to identify clinical features that are associated with laboratory evidence of UTI (bacteriuria [>100,000 colony forming units on urine culture] plus pyuria [>10 white blood cells on urinalysis]). Our a priori HYPOTHESIS is that specific clinical features (i.e., change in mental status, fever, change in voiding pattern) will be associated with laboratory evidence of UTI. This observational cohort study will be conducted at five New Haven area nursing homes with a sample size estimate of 493 residents. Persons aged 65 years or older will undergo baseline assessment upon enrollment and repeat assessment when suspected of having UTI. A logistic regression model will be used to determine bivariate and multivariable associations between clinical features and laboratory evidence of UTI. A ROC curve will be calculated from the final multivariable logistic regression model. Those clinical features independently associated with laboratory evidence of UTI will be combined with bacteriuria and pyuria to create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Identifying clinically relevant UTI in nursing home residents is a common dilemma with important functional, economic, and infection control implications. This study will create an evidence-based definition of UTI. Future studies will identify residents with UTI in whom antibiotic therapy improves clinical outcome.           n/a",Clinical Features in Nursing Home Residents with Suspected UTI,7201957,R03AG028057,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic-resistant organism', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriuria', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colony-forming units', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysuria', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Leukocytes', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Pyuria', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Hypertension', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Urinalysis', 'Urinary tract', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'functional decline', 'improved', 'mortality', 'young adult']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,67650,550947887,-0.003929363298129244
"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,50343425,-0.03449939449699614
"Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uveal ('eye') melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that evolve in the choroidal tissues of the inner eye. The goal of this research is to examine whether serum levels of vitamin D, a 'nutrient' derived from sun exposure, is a prognostic factor in melanoma of the eye. The hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), is a well-known potent regulator of cell growth and differentiation in cells and tissues expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and there is recent evidence of an inhibiting effect on tumor invasion and metastasis. However, only limited data are available from human studies. The proposed investigation will be based on a large series of eye melanoma patients treated over a 13 year period (1992-2004) at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in Boston, a leading referral center for diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis and serum and buffy coat fractions were stored at -70C. In the planned study, vital status of the patients will be updated on all surviving patients by chart review and a search of the Social Security, and National Death Indexes. Of 1,493 patients with stored sera and DNA, an estimated 272 deaths from tumor causes (the 'cases') will be identified (median follow up: 8.7 years). For each case, one matched control will be selected, similar to the case on clinical prognostic factors and year of diagnosis, and alive and free of metastasis. Serum samples will be tested for levels of calcidiol (25(OH)D3), the depot for biosynthesis of active vitamin D. Case-control comparisons for vitamin levels will be performed using conditional logistic regression. Specific genotypes and haplotypes in the VDR will also be examined for relationships to melanoma outcome, and interactions with serum vitamin D levels will be explored. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation of its kind, based on a unique resource of prospectively collected serum and DNA, and long-term patient follow up. The proposed study will provide new information on the relationship of vitamin D to mortality from eye melanoma. Because vitamin D is believed to have multiple inhibitory actions in cancer metastasis, the data may be applicable to other cancer sites. If the proposed hypotheses are supported, findings may offer novel insights, and point to new strategies for cancer control.           n/a",Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma,7255468,R03CA119751,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anabolism', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Calcifediol', 'Calcitriol', 'Calendar', 'Cancer Control', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Choroid', 'Ciliary Body', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Epidemiology', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hair', 'Haplotypes', 'Investigation', 'Iris', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Melanins', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'National Security', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Non-Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Ocular Melanoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pigments', 'Play', 'Production', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Social Security', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Staging', 'Sun Exposure', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Update', 'Uveal Melanoma', 'Vision', 'Vital Status', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'case control', 'cell growth', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'human study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'malignant neoplasm of eye', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'size', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,H.

"Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the detailed molecular mechanisms that connect genotype, phenotype and response to therapy in lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). LSDs are a family of genetic metabolic diseases caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. In this project we use Fabry disease as a model system to develop a bioinformatics-based paradigm to address two fundamental issues: 1) The relationship between genotype and phenotype in LSDs. This task is challenging because in LSDs different mutations in the same enzyme often lead to different disease phenotypes. 2) The relationship between genotype and response to ""pharmacological chaperone"" therapy. Pharmacological chaperones are small-molecule ligands that are used to rescue mutants, resulting in increased enzymatic activity; several Fabry mutations have been shown to be rescueable in this way. The same therapy is likely to be useful for other LSDs, particularly those with neurological involvement, for which enzyme replacement therapy is not viable. The two aims of this application address, at different levels, both issues described above. The first aim, tests the hypothesis that knowing the change that occurs in the protein sequence, together with the structural environment in which it occurs, is sufficient to predict the resulting disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is tested through the rigorous training of classification methods using sequence and structure-derived descriptors for a large set of Fabry mutants of known phenotype. The resulting classification provides a large- scale quantitative description of the correlation between genotype and phenotype. The accuracy of predictions based on this approach is a measure of how much information about the genotype the descriptors contain. The same approach will be used to establish a quantitative correlation between genotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. Finally, applying the classification methods to mutations in other LSDs will test the generality of the approach. The second aim of this application addresses the issue of genotype/phenotype correlation from a biophysical point of view. We test the hypothesis that a combination of factors, mainly folding free energy, ligand binding affinity, and relative pH stability of the mutants determines the disease phenotype and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy. This is done analyzing selected mutants using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme/ligand and enzyme/receptor interactions, as well as, pH stability, and other calculations. The methods used in the second aim are very detailed, but are not applicable at a large scale. Thus, both aims provide complementary views of genotype/phenotype correlation in LSDs. The successful completion of this project will, for the first time, provide a quantitative connection between genotype and phenotype in LSDs and a detailed biophysical description of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype/phenotype correlations and response to pharmacological chaperone therapy in Fabry disease. Relevance of this research to public health. Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of more than 40 genetic metabolic disorders. Worldwide, the incidence of patients with LSDs is estimated to be ~ 1 in 8,000 live births. Understanding the correlation between genotype, phenotype, and response to treatment in these diseases will help in their diagnosis and treatment, particularly for LSDs that affect the brain, for which no effective treatment is available to date.          n/a",Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in Lysosomal Storage Diseases,7239204,R21DK078345,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fabry Disease', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Galactosidase', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Live Birth', 'Lysosomal Storage Diseases', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Models', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'None or Not Applicable', 'Numbers', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'enzyme deficiency', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'enzyme structure', 'enzyme substrate', 'family genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'mutant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein degradation', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'three dimensional structure']",NIDDK,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2007,127125,0,-0.02388634385581609
"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7274714,R21AT002520,"['Acupuncture Therapy', 'Acupuncture procedure', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Androgens', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'Enrollment', 'Equation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Infertility', 'Insulin', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'OGTT', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovulation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prolactin', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin', 'Simulate', 'Smoking Status', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Syndrome', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Week', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'follow-up', 'interest', 'reproductive', 'reproductive hormone', 'treatment duration']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R21,2007,148916,169622494,-0.0127356052394641
"Rett syndrome: determinants of outcome and burden DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This population-based study will follow the current cohort of live (n=225) cases with Rett syndrome in Australia for a further five years. New cases ascertained during the study period will also be included. It will describe the natural history of Rett syndrome and assess its impact on resource utilization and the economic and social burden on families and community in comparison with Down syndrome and a normal comparison group. Baseline data on communication, mobility, symptoms and classification have been gathered on the cohort since 1993. In 2000 data were collected on functional ability in daily living, behavior, hand function, medical conditions, and use of health and education services. Mutation data, collected on 80 percent of cases will be continued. A questionnaire has been developed, piloted and will be used to collect data on function, health and well-being of the Rett syndrome subjects and family in 2002, 2004 and 2006. Data will be gathered for the Down syndrome comparison group in 2003. Participants will respond via paper-based or through secure on-line formats. Optical scanning or on-line data capture will be used for data entry. In 2003 and 2005 clinical assessments or clinical file review will provide EEG, ECG, blood parameters, bone densitometry and autonomic nervous system data. A video protocol developed in 2001 to record functional ability will be extended to include gross motor and oral motor function, hand apraxia, gait assessment and language function. Serial videos collected in 2003 and again in 2005 will enable us to monitor changes over time and the effect of therapy or surgery. Yearly telephone interviews to families will record anthropometric data, current medication usage and update previously collected family tree data. Every two years a validated questionnaire to identify epilepsy type will be included. Resource data to determine the direct, indirect and opportunity costs associated with Rett syndrome will be compared with a normal and Down syndrome comparison group. Data analysis will use multiple regression models to examine effects of different variables on child and family level outcomes and discriminant analysis, recursive partitioning and machine learning to identify genotype/phenotype associations at the individual child level.

"Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs), namely ulcerative colitis (DC) and Crohn's disease (CD), are chronic, lifelong, relapsing illnesses, affecting close to 1 million Americans. Despite the many clues that a dysbiosis may exist in IBD, the specific changes in the microflora of IBD patients are largely unknown. Amplicon length heterogeneity (ALH) is a sophisticated and well established PCR based technology that can be used as a screening tool to identify changes in the Bacterial microflora of IBD patients. We therefore have hypothesized that the ileocolonic microflora in IBD has an altered microbial composition compared to normal microflora. We have gathered preliminary data that shows statistical differences between controls and IBD as well as within IBD patients. Therefore, to test the above hypothesis, we are proposing the following 2 inter-related scientific aims: AIM 1. Identify bacterial fingerprint patterns associated with IBD using ALH. ALH patterns will be determined in a total of 160 IBD patients and health controls and will be analyzed using diversity indeces, multivariate reduction analysis and cluster analysis. ALH patterns associated with IBD will be determined using histograms, ecological software in conjunction with custom PERL scripts as well as supervised and unsupervised automated pattern recognition systems. AIM 2.Determine the bacterial contents of putatively IBD associated ALH fingerprint patterns using molecular cloning and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of targeted samples will be linked to bacterial identities by employing multiple bioinformatics tools. Significance. This proposal involves the first time use of a sophisticated and highly reproducible molecular biology tool, ALH, in the study of microflora in the Gl tract. There is a growing recognition of the importance of microflora in health and disease, including IBD. Studies that characterized microflora in human using powerful techniques from environmental microbiology such as ALH can bring about significant advances in the understanding of Gl tract illnesses. ALH may enable a real-time survey of microfloral changes for the first time in medicine and may provide the first evidence linking IBD with specific microbial patterns.           n/a",Dysbiosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease,7197734,R21DK071838,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bispecific Antibody 2B1', 'Celiac Disease', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cloning', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal part of ileum', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Environmental Microbiology', 'Feces', 'Fingerprint', 'Flare', 'Flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genus Cola', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Cloning', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pattern Recognition Systems', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Probiotics', 'Procedures', 'Race', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Soil', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visual', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disabling disease', 'ileum', 'indexing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'neglect', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prebiotics', 'programs', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIDDK,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,222000,55098220,-0.003084282486883892
"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7313388,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2007,223880,338121506,-0.0899913424021051
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,7153491,R01HD046595,"['Acetaminophen', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Amoxicillin', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dietary intake', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Gastroschisis', 'General Population', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Ibuprofen', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Limb structure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Mothers', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'North America', 'Nurses', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Program', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vitamins', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'improved', 'malformation', 'metropolitan', 'oral cleft', 'prescription document', 'prescription procedure', 'reproductive']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2007,264692,164685352,-0.020597388335596507

"Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brucellosis is a re-emerging zoonotic disease that affects humans and a variety of farm animals. As well as a threat to public health it has considerable economic importance. The etiologic agent responsible for human infection, Brucella melitensis, is classified by both NIAID and CDC as a Category B biothreat pathogen. Antibiotics are only partially effective at controlling the disease and there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis is the key to containing infection. Currently, the most common diagnostic tests for Brucella are based on indirect serology which are lacking in specificity and sensitivity as well as speed of execution. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop improved diagnostics, especially technologies that may be used at field level. This investigation proposes to address this issue and develop a superior and robust technique for diagnosing Brucella infection with highly specific, non-cross reactive antibody reactions. We will achieve this goal by screening the Brucella genome using novel proteomic chip technology to identify unique antigens that will yield highly specific and accurate diagnoses. This work will be undertaken in Phase 1 of the application. In Phase 2, when antigens have been selected, we anticipate that we will proceed to develop ELISA and immunoblot assays. In parallel, both ELISA and lateral flow ""dipstick"" tests for Brucella antigen will be constructed. We envisage that the antigen assays will have particular utility in detecting Brucella disseminated in the context of the bioterrorism event. The diagnostic tools developed within this application will be rigorously evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using large and diverse panels of human and animal Brucella-positive sera available through our collaborators. The project proposes to develop a highly sensitive and robust diagnostic test for brucellosis, also known as ""undulant fever"", an infectious disease that causes serious illness in farm animals and humans. The current techniques for diagnosing infection are somewhat unreliable and based on outmoded methods. This investigation will use state- of-the-art technology to identify new structures or antigens on Brucella bacteria that may be used to develop a test with superior diagnostic performance.          n/a",Development of rapid detection tests for Brucella species,7278655,R43AI068166,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Bioterrorism', 'Brucella', 'Brucella abortus', 'Brucella melitensis', 'Brucellosis', 'Categories', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Event', 'Fluorescence', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunodominant Antigens', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Livestock', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Printing', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serologic tests', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'Yersinia enterocolitica', 'base', 'biothreat', 'disorder control', 'improved', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prototype', 'rapid detection', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,"INBIOS INTERNATIONAL, INC.",R43,2007,278818,299112,-0.005109091299148018
"Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) has doubled in the United States over the past two decades. Hepatitis C is the major risk factor for HCC with approximately 3 million individuals currently infected nationwide. Survival following HCC diagnosis is dismal except where potentially curative therapy (resection, transplant, local ablation) is applied. HCC surveillance is aimed at applying abdominal ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for diagnosing HCC at an early stage when patients are most likely to be eligible for potentially curative therapy. One randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have indicated that HCC surveillance is associated with significantly improved survival. Practice guidelines have recommended HCC surveillance for patients with hepatitis C at high risk of developing HCC. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating the extent of prevalence, patterns, and determinants of HCC surveillance. AIMS: (i) To examine the patterns (prevalence, type, and frequency) of utilization of HCC surveillance in veterans infected with hepatitis C; (2) To examine patient-, facility provider-, and physician provider- determinants of HCC surveillance among veterans infected with hepatitis C; and (3) To examine the effect of HCC surveillance on the receipt of HCC potentially curative therapy and survival among veterans infected with hepatitis C, and to identify surveillance strategies associated with best outcomes. METHODS: We propose to conduct i) a retrospective cohort study of more than 150,000 patients infected with hepatitis C and 39,000 high-risk patients identified from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Registry, 2) a survey of more than 128 provider facilities to supplement information in the registry, and 3) a survey of physician providers to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards HCC surveillance. Surveillance tests will be identified in the registry based on a previously developed algorithm using data from administrative files. Patient-, tumor-, and facility determinants of HCC surveillance will be identifed from the Hepatitis C Registry and supplemented by the facility survey. Additionally, we will examine the association between surveillance and receipt of resection, transplant, or local ablation as well as survival. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to examine these outcomes. IMPACT: This study will examine a previously unaddressed subject pertaining to a highly fatal cancer that thus far has received little attention. It will provide information on the effectiveness of HCC screening as reflected by the extent of use as well as outcomes. Evaluating the extent and patterns of HCC surveillance is crucial in understanding diffusion (and obstacles) of this practice and in designing interventions to improve the implementation of HCC surveillance.           n/a",Surveillance for Hepatocellular Carcinoma among HCV-infected Veterans,7320503,R01CA125487,"['Abdomen', 'Ablation', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,291650,323604360,-0.0051984075890999185

"Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Uveal ('eye') melanomas are aggressive neoplasms that evolve in the choroidal tissues of the inner eye. The goal of this research is to examine whether serum levels of vitamin D, a 'nutrient' derived from sun exposure, is a prognostic factor in melanoma of the eye. The hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol), is a well-known potent regulator of cell growth and differentiation in cells and tissues expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and there is recent evidence of an inhibiting effect on tumor invasion and metastasis. However, only limited data are available from human studies. The proposed investigation will be based on a large series of eye melanoma patients treated over a 13 year period (1992-2004) at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, in Boston, a leading referral center for diagnosis and treatment of these tumors. Blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis and serum and buffy coat fractions were stored at -70C. In the planned study, vital status of the patients will be updated on all surviving patients by chart review and a search of the Social Security, and National Death Indexes. Of 1,493 patients with stored sera and DNA, an estimated 272 deaths from tumor causes (the 'cases') will be identified (median follow up: 8.7 years). For each case, one matched control will be selected, similar to the case on clinical prognostic factors and year of diagnosis, and alive and free of metastasis. Serum samples will be tested for levels of calcidiol (25(OH)D3), the depot for biosynthesis of active vitamin D. Case-control comparisons for vitamin levels will be performed using conditional logistic regression. Specific genotypes and haplotypes in the VDR will also be examined for relationships to melanoma outcome, and interactions with serum vitamin D levels will be explored. To our knowledge, this will be the first investigation of its kind, based on a unique resource of prospectively collected serum and DNA, and long-term patient follow up. The proposed study will provide new information on the relationship of vitamin D to mortality from eye melanoma. Because vitamin D is believed to have multiple inhibitory actions in cancer metastasis, the data may be applicable to other cancer sites. If the proposed hypotheses are supported, findings may offer novel insights, and point to new strategies for cancer control.           n/a",Serum Vitamin D and Mortality from Eye Melanoma,7151718,R03CA119751,"['death', 'diagnosis', 'eye', 'melanoma', 'metastasis', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'serum', 'vitamin D']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2006,4780,377931988,-0.019621101444924162
"Longitudinal Psychometric Investigation of the WISDM Tobacco Dependence Measure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Description: The construct of nicotine dependence (ND) is assumed to underlie tobacco addiction but there is a notable lack of consensus about the nature and optimal measurement of ND. In applied research, ND is often assumed to be a dimensional, trait-like condition with varying degrees of severity although some studies use categorical or discrete diagnostic conceptualizations of ND as found in the DSM-IV diagnosis of Nicotine Dependence. There is increasing evidence that ND is multidimensional. Only recently have psychometrically sound, theoretically-based, multidimensional measures of ND been developed, such as the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM). The WISDM measures thirteen smoking dependence motives that are hypothesized to influence dependence processes such as inability to quit, nicotine withdrawal, and relapse. The WISDM subscales reflect a variety of theory-based internal factors (e.g., tolerance) and external factors (e.g., social and environmental goads to smoke) that permit investigation of different smoking motives in clinical and experimental contexts. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the nature of ND by assessing measurement and structural invariance across gender and racial/ethnic groups and time as well as investigating the predictive, concurrent, convergent, and discriminant validity of WISDM subscales. This will be accomplished by conducting a series of secondary analyses on datasets from two observational studies and two smoking cessation clinical trials that administered the WISDM to culturally diverse smokers (White, African American, and Hispanic). Latent variable (e.g., multigroup confirmatory factor analyses) and other models will test for invariance of key model parameters (e.g., factor covariances) across gender and racial/ethnic groups as a means of evaluating similarity of multidimensional models across the groups. Validity analyses will include multivariate linear and logistic regression models as well as latent variable modeling that will allow complex tests of individual WISDM dimensions or sets of dimensions in relation to smoking and relapse. Observed measures such as cigarettes smoked per day, latency between first cigarette and regular use of cigarettes, and end-of- treatment cessation success will be related to WISDM measures in these validity analyses. The goal of all of these analyses is to characterize dimensions that represent core features of ND that influence smoking behavior as well as cessation and relapse. Lay Description: This study will investigate how various theoretical dimensions of nicotine dependence, as measured by the 13-factor Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives, relate to one another and to important smoking- and cessation-related outcomes and whether these relations are consistent across gender and racial/ethnic groups.           n/a",Longitudinal Psychometric Investigation of the WISDM Tobacco Dependence Measure,7226812,R03CA126406,"['clinical research', 'ethnic group', 'measurement', 'model', 'nicotine', 'psychometrics', 'sex', 'smoking', 'smoking cessation', 'tobacco']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON,R03,2006,76953,0,-0.0057924618613867974

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7140644,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,182119,0,-0.006417265793878517
"Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Polycystic Ovary Disease (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive age women, and is the most common cause of irregular cycles and anovulatory infertility. Acupuncture may represent an alternative to hormonal treatment for these women, based on three studies with positive findings with fewer than 50 acupuncture subjects and no control group. The best of these studies examined 24 PCOS women and found that 38% of the women had restored ovulation (2+ ovulations) during the treatment plus follow-up time period. The proposed research will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess if acupuncture restores ovulation (2+ ovulations) and normalizes ovarian hormones in women v/ith PCOS. Participants (n=78 completers) will be randomized to receive either acupuncture treatment or a sham procedure (Park Sham Device) for a standard 8-week period of time. All participants will provide blood samples through the University of Virginia General Clinical Research Center before treatment, after treatment, and three months later from which reproductive hormones, androgens and insulin/glucose will be assayed. Urine samples will be provided weekly throughout the treatment and follow-up periods to determine if ovulation has occurred. To collect data on potential confounders, weight will be measured and questionnaires administered at the same three time periods as the blood samples. Results will be analyzed with a combination of odds ratios, multiple logistic regression, repeated measures analyses, generalized estimating equations, and analysis of covariance. This study will be a clear enhancement compared to the existing literature by inclusion of a sham treatment control group, rigorous diagnosis of PCOS, and collection of blood samples timed to the menstrual cycle (applicable when there is an ovulatory cycle). This research will assess within our PCOS population whether acupuncture increases ovulatory frequency, causes the ratio of follicle simulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) to normalize, and causes the mean levels of FSH and LH to adjust towards normal levels (increase and decrease, respectively). Toward future research, an exploratory analysis will also be conducted to estimate if some patient groups (e.g., normal insulin, smaller body mass index) are more responsive to acupuncture therapy. We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,7140060,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2006,201729,0,-0.0127356052394641
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6979792,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2006,272621,164685352,-0.020597388335596507
"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215). The proposed research is important because it will help identify the nature and the strength of the association between preterm delivery and periodontal disease-related factors which are modifiable in comparison to a majority of obstetrical risk factors that are not as easily changed. These associations have potential application in the early diagnosis and prevention of preterm deliveries. A major strength of the study is the efficacy gained by utilizing existing data and samples from a large cohort study. The collective expertise of the investigative team and the excellent clinical and research facilities are additional strengths.      n/a",Periodontal Disease and Prematurity,7053359,R01DE015594,"['bacterial disease', 'clinical research', 'comorbidity', 'enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', 'female', 'human subject', 'immunoglobulin G', 'periodontium disorder', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pregnancy infection', 'premature labor', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,316973,77336088,0.0031560021650182696

"Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of an innovative multi-microphone probe and acquisition system for recording otoacoustic emissions {OAEs} with advanced noise cancellation algorithms, increased frequency and intensity ranges and pressurization capabilities is proposed. Two advanced noise cancellation algorithm will be implemented: 1) a multi-reference adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) network and 2) two-dimensional filtering. These algorithms will utilize the independent measurements provided by the multiple microphones in order to reduce noise contaminants. Each microphone or microphone groupings will be connected to individual analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in order to allow for the implementation of the digital signal processing algorithms. The pressurization capabilities of the probe will allow implementation of tympanometry and the acquisition of OAEs while compensating for pressure imbalances between the outer and middle ear. Results from a prototype single microphone long probe are presented demonstrating that the design concept is valid and provides good quality OAE recordings while reducing the undesirable effects of the metal response. The proposed probe will also improve upon the limited dynamic and frequency range of current OAE probes. The probe is expected to be able to provide stimulus levels of up to 90 dB HL and a frequency response of up to 24 kHz. During Phase I, various probes will be constructed and tested under different noise conditions in adult and infant subjects. During Phase II, the pressurization capabilities of the new probe will be further developed and examined. The optimal probe designed will be implemented along with the optimal noise cancellation algorithm and tested in a comprehensive clinical study incorporating the pressurization capabilities of the probe. n/a",Multi-microphone long probe for OAE acquisition,6933674,R43DC007543,"['adult human (21+)', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'ear disorder diagnosis', 'infant human (0-1 year)', 'mathematics', 'noise', 'otoacoustic emission', 'sound frequency']",NIDCD,INTELLIGENT HEARING SYSTEMS,R43,2005,100000,618360,-0.010669996972986059

We will also compare enrollment strategies for population-based recruitment of women into an acupuncture clinical trial.         n/a",Acupuncture/Reproductive Hormones/Ovulation/Polycystic,6970579,R21AT002520,"['acupuncture /acupressure', 'alternative medicine', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'female', 'follicle stimulating hormone', 'hormone regulation /control mechanism', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'luteinizing hormone', 'ovulation', 'patient oriented research', 'pituitary gonadal axis', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE,R21,2005,206584,0,-0.0127356052394641
"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects. Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0,-0.006417265793878517
"Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, and amoxicillin are among the most commonly used drugs during pregnancy, but the safety of these medications with respect to birth defects is not established. Given the wide use of these drugs, even a small increase in the risk of birth defects may have considerable clinical and public health implications. We propose to evaluate the association between these drugs and 1) specific malformations previously hypothesized to be associated with each of them, and 2) specific malformations that occur most commonly in the general population. In addition, we propose to evaluate other commonly used medications by systematically screening each exposure in relation to the risk of specific malformations. These goals can be achieved at relatively modest cost by taking advantage of a large existing ongoing multicenter case-control surveillance program of birth defects in North America, the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study (BDS). The BDS involves approximately 95 institutions in four metropolitan areas (Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and San Diego), and for over 25 years has interviewed over 20,000 mothers of malformed infants and over 4,000 mothers of non-malformed infants. The BDS identifies infants with a wide range of malformations within 5 months after birth at tertiary and birth hospitals, and within 6 months of delivery, study nurses interview mothers about demographic, reproductive, and medical factors; medication and vitamin use; cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption; and dietary intake. The study has discovered likely teratogenic effects that have subsequently been confirmed by others (e.g., salycilates in relation to gastroschisis). In the proposed analyses, we will estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using logistic regression, and results will be adjusted for potential confounders. Findings will test hypotheses about some drugs and provide leads for further research for others; both objectives seek to improve our understanding of risks associated with drugs commonly used by pregnant women. n/a",Teratogenicity of Drugs Most Commonly Used in Pregnancy,6867958,R01HD046595,"['acetaminophen', 'aspirin', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'congenital cardiovascular disorder', 'congenital nervous system disorder', 'congenital reproductive system disorder', 'congenital skeletal disorder', 'embryo /fetus drug adverse effect', 'gestational age', 'human data', 'human pregnant subject', 'ibuprofen', 'penicillins', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy disorder chemotherapy', 'self medication', 'statistics /biometry', 'teratogens']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2005,279306,164685352,-0.020597388335596507
"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase.

"Periodontal Disease and Prematurity    DESCRIPTION: Babies who are born prematurely and/or are underweight at birth are 20-80 times more likely to die before their first birthday. A significant proportion of preterm deliveries occur in women who are free of known risk factors. Periodontal disease is emerging as a potential risk factor although the results from human studies are equivocal. The long-term objective of this research is to further evaluate the extent to which the infections of periodontal origin play a role in preterm delivery. The primary Specific Aims of this project are 1) to measure the association between periodontal pathogens in cervical and vaginal samples of pregnant women and preterm birth, and 2) to measure the association between prenatal maternal serum IgG levels against specific periodontal pathogens and preterm birth. These Aims will be accomplished by conducting a nested case-control study within a large ongoing cohort study at the New York University Medical School (March-of-Dimes Study). Frozen serum and cervico-vaginal samples, data on biochemical markers such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFalpha, and Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and validated questionnaire data on quality-of-life are available from this study. As of October 1,2003, there were 1579 subjects enrolled in this study and 1054 have already delivered (7% preterm deliveries and 10% low birth weight). Sixty-nine percent were Hispanic and 85% were 19-34 years of age. This study has two more years of enrollment remaining with an estimated 215 new recruits per year. Accordingly, we estimate that by October 2005 there will likely be 140 preterm and 1869 full term deliveries. Three pair-matched controls for each preterm delivery case will be selected from the full-term delivery subjects based on age, race, and date of delivery. Periodontal pathogens will be measured in cervico-vaginal samples using a checkerboard assay, and periodontal pathogen-specific IgG levels will be measured in serum samples using ELISA. Conditional logistic regression analysis will be used in the data analysis. As a secondary Aim, on an exploratory basis, levels of periodontal pathogens in oral, cervical, and vaginal samples, and periodontal pathogen specific serum IgG levels will be correlated with each other and also with preterm birth using fresh samples collected from the subjects that will be recruited to the March-of-Dimes Study after this application is funded (October 04-Oct 05; N=215).

"Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The long-term objectives of this project are to improve the safety and availability of the US blood supply. The principal aim of this SBIR Competing Continuation Phase II Proposal for a Paperless Quality Donor System with Decision Making is to complete the development of its Quality Donor System(tm) (QDS) and to secure ongoing 510(k) clearances for it from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologies Evaluation and Research (CBER) for implementation and evaluation of the total system in blood centers and hospital blood banks.      The research is based on continuing development of the Quality Donor System and deploying it in regional blood centers and hospital blood banks. System use by donors and staff and user satisfaction will be measured and analyzed to assess success. Blood safety is enhanced by eliminating FDA-reportable errors and by increasing blood donor honesty in disclosing risky behaviors.

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6796148,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', 'antihistamines', 'biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenesis inhibitor', 'chemokine', 'clinical research', 'cytokine receptors', 'genetic polymorphism', 'glioma', 'human data', 'human genetic material tag', 'human tissue', 'hypersensitivity', 'interleukin 13', 'interleukin 4', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer genetics', 'neoplasm /cancer immunology', 'nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2004,68103,241268189,-0.03156248373667149
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6725468,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'female', 'gonorrhea', 'human subject', 'interview', 'reproductive system infection', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'sign /symptom', 'urinalysis', 'urinary tract infection', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2004,74500,0,-0.015227159927693953
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause.

Ultrasonic responses of the tooth structure will be analyzed by a pattern recognition expert system (artificial intelligence) to determine the diagnosis of the tooth inspected. The proposed research will eventually help to reduce the use of harmful X-ray radiation in Dental clinics and contribute to artificial intelligence based diagnosis. The proposed concept has been successfully demonstrated in the previous Phase I study. In this Phase II study, instrumentation for clinical data collection using a combination of conventional piezoelectric and new laser-based ultrasonic technologies will be developed and optimized; an artificial intelligence based diagnostic function will be developed using clinical data and implemented using embedded computing; numerical simulations will be used to enhance diagnostic function development; and finally, initial clinical trials will be conducted to demonstrate the performance of the prototype equipment. The ultrasonic apparatus for Dental diagnosis outlined in this application is a first application of AI-based NDE in Dentistry.

"Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    An inverse association between self-reported allergic conditions (ACs) and glioma has been previously observed in seven case-control and two cohort studies. The mechanism for this association is not known, however, two cytokines that play a central role in ACs (i.e., interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13) also suppress glioma growth. From among genetic polymorphisms that are associated with risk of ACs, we have identified polymorphisms also involved in normal astrocyte growth or glioma pathogenesis. Gene products of genetic polymorphisms found on the IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Ralpha, IL-13Ralpha1, HLA -DRB1, RANTES, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) play a role in both ACs and the brain. We will examine the case-control distribution of these polymorphisms and haplotypes to: 1) test the hypothesis that polymorphisms associated with ACs reduce glioma risk; 2) identify differential misclassification of serf-reported ACs (unequal measurement of cases and controls); 3) find out whether antihistamine use interferes with protection against glioma afforded by ACs; and 4) determine whether AC polymorphisms affect glioma risk independently of their association with ACs. The innovation in the proposed study is to focus on polymorphisms associated with ACs, an epidemiologic risk factor that reduces glioma risk, rather than on polymorphisms associated with carcinogenesis as has been done in previous studies.      Our pilot study will make use of interviews with 260 glioma cases and 450 controls that have already been conducted and blood samples that have been collected in conjunction a population-based case-control study of mobile telephone use and brain tumors in Sweden. Study participants were asked whether they have been diagnosed with asthma, eczema, hay fever or other allergies, continue to have allergies, have symptoms of allergies without a diagnosis, and have used allergy medication. Twenty ml of blood from each participant was collected and stored in a -80 degree freezer and DNA preparation is ongoing. Each participant will be evaluated for the presence AC polymorphisms. Unconditional logistic regression will be used to estimate the association between AC polymorphisms and glioma risk. Assuming a 0.05 significance level and 80 percent power, depending on the polymorphism, the proposed sample is large enough to detect a confounding-adjusted odds ratios of 0.6. n/a",Allergic Condition Biomarkers and Glioma Risk,6694204,R03CA103379,"['MHC class II antigen', ' antihistamines', ' biomarker', ' cancer risk', ' carcinogenesis inhibitor', ' chemokine', ' clinical research', ' cytokine receptors', ' genetic polymorphism', ' glioma', ' human data', ' human genetic material tag', ' human tissue', ' hypersensitivity', ' interleukin 13', ' interleukin 4', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplasm /cancer immunology', ' nitric oxide synthase']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,73750,241268189,-0.03156248373667149
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6600325,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Trichomonas vaginalis', ' adolescence (12-20)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' female', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' interview', ' reproductive system infection', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' sign /symptom', ' urinalysis', ' urinary tract infection', "" women's health""]",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2003,74500,0,-0.015227159927693953

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes.

"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications.

The feasibility of the       proposed research concept will be demonstrated, if: 1) meaningful ultrasonic         tests can be conducted using the simple piezo-/opto-ultrasonic system on the         tooth specimens collected; 2) various Dental pathologies in the tooth specimens      may be characterized by using wave pattern of the ultrasonic responses; and 3)       by identifying particular features of an ultrasonic wave pattern, the actual         tooth pathology may be recognized.

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).

"Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia   DESCRIPTION (Applicant's abstract): Preeclampsia, the sudden onset of high           blood pressure along with proteinuria during pregnancy, is a serious                 complication affecting nearly one in every 20 pregnancies. It is the main cause      of maternal death worldwide, and affects women of all races and socioeconomic        groups. Unfortunately, no definitive preventive treatment is currently               available for this ominous disease. Scientists now believe that preeclampsia is      a disease of the endothelium, due in part to oxidative stress. As such, regular      exercise has emerged as a potential preventive measure. This contrasts to daily      low dose aspirin or calcium supplement which have failed to demonstrate a            significant effect and may have adverse effects. The purpose of this study is        to determine if moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy will reduce the         incidence of preeclampsia and to assess the process (involving oxidative stress      and antioxidant process) hypothesized to explain the effect of exercise on           preeclampsia. This is a randomized clinical trial with a total of 250 pregnant       subjects at risk for preeclampsia. Eligible subjects will enter a run-in period      (i.e., qualifying period) at 14 to 18 weeks gestation. Baseline data to be           obtained include demographic information, health history, daily physical             activities, cardiovascular fitness level, blood pressure, blood sample for           serum iron, transferrin, low density lipoprotein, malondialdehyde, superoxide        dismutase. At 18 weeks, compliant subjects will be randomly assigned to either       the exercise (40 min., 70 percent VO2max, 5x/week) or sham exercise (control         group; 10 min. stretch exercise, 5x/week) condition. For both groups, all            baseline measurements will be repeated at 28 weeks (Outcome I). Subjects will        continue the exercise regimen after 28 weeks up to her term and as long as it        is safe and comfortable. A blood sample will be collected again during labor         (Outcome II). Subjects who undergo cesarean section for obstetrical reasons          will provide a small amount of subcutaneous tissue at the time of incision to        measure endothelial superoxide dismutase. Medical records will be reviewed for       additional outcome data (pregnancy/birth outcomes and diagnosis of                   preeclampsia). Chi-square tests of association and logistic regression analysis      will be applied to address the effect of exercise, prediction of preeclampsia,       and other pregnancy outcomes. Repeated Measures ANOVA will be applied to assess      the effect of exercise on various biological markers. ANCOVA will be applied to      control confounding factors.                                                                                                                                              n/a",Regular Exercise Among Women at Risk for Preeclampsia,6383723,R01NR005002,"['antioxidants', ' cardiovascular disorder therapy', ' clinical trials', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' erythrocytes', ' exercise', ' female', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' lipid peroxides', ' low density lipoprotein', ' oxidative stress', ' patient oriented research', ' preeclampsia', ' superoxide dismutase', ' vascular endothelium', "" women's health""]",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2001,318810,641965656,0.011273898804903294
"GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from Investigator's Abstract) Gestational diabetes             mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of several adverse infant and       maternal outcomes and its clinical recognition can reduce these risks. There is      concern that the current criteria for GDM may be to restrictive and that             residual excess risk of perinatal complications exists below present cutoff          values. The proposed study will evaluate whether among women without GDM (as         defined by current criteria), increasing levels of maternal glycemia are             associated with increased risk of selected perinatal complications: infant           severe macrosomia, severe hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, respiratory              distress syndrome, and maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia. To accomplish this, the      investigators propose to conduct five nested case-control studies, one for each      of the complications of interest, within a large multiethnic cohort of               approximately 74,000 women who were screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation at       Kaiser Permanente, Northern California between 1995 and 1998. In this setting        nearly 94 percent of the pregnant women are screened for GDM by a 50 gm., 1 hr.      oral glucose tolerance test (50 g, 1-h OGTT) and approximately 15 percent have       are abnormal screening and go on to receive the diagnostic (100-g, 3-h OGTT)         test. Potential cases of each type of complication will be identified by             searching computerized hospitalization and laboratory databases. For each of         the infant complications, 500 cases will be randomly selected without knowledge      of the maternal glucose values. A single control group for the infant                complication case groups will be 1,000 infants randomly selected from all            births and frequency matched on gestational age to the distribution of the           combined case group. Five hundred women with either preeclampsia or eclampsia        and 500 age-matched controls will be randomly selected. The medical records of       the 3,000 mother-infant pairs in the four case-control studies on infant             complications, and 1,000 women for the case-control study of                         preeclampsia/eclampsia, will be abstracted to confirm eligibility, and, if so,       to ascertain data on possible maternal and infant covariates. Logistic               regression will be used to estimate the odds ratios associated with several          levels of pregnancy glycemia and perinatal complications. The investigators          state that the proposed study will provide important knowledge about the             magnitude of the risk of severe perinatal complications associated with degrees      of maternal hyperglycemia below the glucose cutpoints currently used to              diagnose GDM.                                                                                                                                                             n/a",GESTATIONAL DIABETES:  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND OUTCOMES,6402593,R01DK054834,"['blood glucose', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnostic tests', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' embryo /fetus disorder', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human pregnant subject', ' human subject', ' mother /infant health care', ' outcomes research', ' preeclampsia']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2001,384853,111231681,-0.0032607304157668206
"BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK Several studies have shown that people born small or thin have increased risk for developing Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults.  These observations have led to the ""fetal origins"" hypothesis - that susceptibility to these chronic adult conditions may be programmed in utero.  The profound metabolic and hemodynamic changes that occur in gestation make pregnancy a physiologic stress test for glucose intolerance, hypertension, and other IRS-related abnormalities. Gestational diabetes (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) are two common complications of pregnancy that share many characteristics of IRS, and also predict a woman's risk for the later development of NIDDM and CVD.  We propose to investigate the effects of a woman's growth before her own birth (indicated by her own birthweight and gestational age) on her risk in young adulthood for PIH or GDM.  Apart from promising preliminary work we have recently completed in Colorado, this is an area of investigation that has not previously been explored.  The proposal is to conduct a case-control study based on birth registry and hospital discharge data from New York State and New York City, computer-linked across a generation.  Subjects will be women who were born in NY after 1959 and delivered a live singleton infant in New York between 1990 and 1996.  Cases will be subjects who had PIH and/or GDM diagnosed during a recent pregnancy (1990-1996), while controls will be subjects frequency matched to cases on hospital and year of delivery, but without a diagnosis of PIH or GDM.  The records of each subject's recent pregnancy (1990-1996) will be matched to those of her own birth (12-36 years earlier).  We will use multiple logistic regression to estimate the independent effects of a mother's own early growth, as indicated by birth weight and gestational age, on her later risk of developing GDM or PIH.  The analysis will account for potential confounding and effect-modifying factors, including race/ethnicity, maternal age, and smoking.  We will also conduct a sub-study of the validity of the diagnoses of GDM and PIH on the birth records.  This study will thus offer a powerful and cost-efficient way to investigate the hypothesis of the fetal origins of GDM and PIH, two common but still poorly understood complications of pregnancy which are associated with increased risk for chronic disease later in life.  n/a",BIRTHWEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE RISK,6177562,R03DK053608,"['age at pregnancy', ' chronic disease /disorder', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' gestational age', ' gestational diabetes mellitus', ' human birth weight', ' human data', ' longitudinal human study', ' pregnancy toxemia /hypertension', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' tobacco abuse']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2000,75443,292134808,0.0033619627592780263
"PCR ASSAY FOR RAPID DETECTION OF FUNGAL INFECTION DESCRIPTION:  The research plan relates to the importance of the observation     that relatively late diagnosis of fungal infections in bone marrow               transplant (BMT) patients, combined with unsatisfactory treatment options,       have led to mortality in greater than 90% of patients with invasive              Aspergillus infection and in 40% of patients with Candida bloodstream            infection.  Moreover, invasive aspergillosis has emerged as the leading          cause of infectious death after BMT.  Rapid detection of fungal DNA is           practical with the application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)                amplification.  Three sets of oligonucleotide primer pairs were made, based      on homologous areas of the nucleic acid sequence of the 18S ribosomal RNA        gene subunit, and therefore function as ""universal"" fungal primers.  PCR         assays will be used to detect DNA from Aspergillus species, Candida species,     and other medically relevant fungi in blood specimens before, during, and        after evidence of clinical disease.  This tool will be used to chart the         previously uncharacterized natural history of fungal infections.  The time       of acquisition of infection, analysis of the source and site of invasion,        and determination of the mode of dissemination will be determined for            Aspergillus and Candida.  PCR assay results will be compared with culture        results from non-sterile specimens as a means of examining colonization or       invasion of the fungal pathogen.  Logistic regression methodology will be        utilized to model the sensitivities and specificities of the assays for          predicting onset of clinical disease and to examine the assays as a monitor      of response to anti-fungal therapy.  The PCR methodology defined in these        studies will be the critical basis for more sensitive detection of fungal        infection and the foundation for improving the serious morbidity and high        mortality associated with fungal infection in the BMT setting.  Methods for      quantitation of PCR assay results will be developed in later years of the        project and the response to antifungal therapy will be correlated completed.     It is proposed these correlations may lead to methods for determining the        intensity and duration of antifungal therapy.  The experimental techniques       are expected to provide fundamental training in the use of molecular biology     to answer other questions of pathogenesis in mycology.                            n/a",PCR ASSAY FOR RAPID DETECTION OF FUNGAL INFECTION,6169420,K08AI001411,"['Aspergillus', ' Candida', ' bone marrow transplantation', ' clinical research', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' fungal genetics', ' human subject', ' mycosis', ' nucleic acid sequence', ' oligonucleotides', ' pathologic process', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' postoperative complications', ' rapid diagnosis', ' ribosomal RNA']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K08,2000,124195,340417756,0.00020825794498086382
