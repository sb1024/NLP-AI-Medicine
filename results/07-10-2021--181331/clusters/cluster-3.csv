"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit. This study will provide a foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer through increasing cervical cancer screening rates with an innovative technology, self-sampling for HPV testing. Project Narrative Women who are low-income and never/underscreeners are unequally burdened by cervical cancer. This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,10025580,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2020,32590,232986943,0.04385373906571688
"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9936304,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2020,45234,340417756,0.052943084446378866
"Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer This is an application for renewal of Clinical Center designation of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center has provided considerable leadership in the organization and progress of the CPDPC. Dr. Pandol serves as co-chair of the Steering Committee and Dr. Goodarzi co-chairs the Type 3c Working Group. We have excelled in recruitment and retention of participants in the cohort studies implemented through the CPDPC designed to elucidate the natural history and develop means of diagnosis, treatment and clinical management of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and its complications in children and adults, and to determine the pathogenic interrelationships of diabetes and pancreatic cancer and develop the means of early diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we have been performing a number ancillary and associated studies to support the overall goals of CPDPC, including: 1. Epidemiologic studies defining risk factors for pancreatic cancer and the natural history of CP; 2. Determining that genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for diabetes associated with CP; 3. Developing liquid biopsy assays for aiding in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and CP; 4. Investigating mechanisms of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer for rational pharmaceutical treatments; and 5. Conducting pilot clinical trials for treatment of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis. For the next phase of the CPDPC we are committed to the following Specific Aims: 1. Continue recruitment and retention of subjects in CPDPC cohort studies (PROCEED, INSPPIRE 2, NOD,  DETECT) in existing and additional study sites, as well as increase diversity in the study population. 2. Continue currently supported ancillary studies to further develop risk factor models combined with liquid  biopsy assays for early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and advance mechanism-  based treatments and clinical trials for recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. 3. Build models that combine clinical features with genetic susceptibility to allow the prediction of future  development of diabetes in patients with chronic pancreatitis. 4. Determine the role of pancreatic enzyme replacement in regulating glucose homeostasis in patients with  chronic pancreatitis and diabetes, with or without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. 5. Use existing and annotated pre-diagnostic CT scans to develop artificial intelligence-based techniques for  highly sensitive and specific methods for CT-based early pancreatic cancer detection. Our Center involves Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Public Health System with an organizational structure designed to expand recruitment into cohort studies of CPDPC with increased diversity and to facilitate our participation in ancillary studies. This is an application to renew the “Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer,” which consists of an expert team well-qualified to carry out studies of the Consortium in Los Angeles County, the most populous and ethnically diverse county in the United States. We plan to adjust and expand our recruitment strategies for cohort studies of the Consortium to help meet national goals; we will also continue progress on a series of ancillary studies within the Consortium designed to detect and treat pancreatic diseases. In addition, we propose new studies to develop prediction models for diabetes in chronic pancreatitis, interrogate the role of digestive enzyme insufficiency in this form of diabetes, and develop novel imaging-based methods for early pancreatic cancer detection that will, in turn, decrease the morbidity of pancreatic cancer.","Greater Los Angeles Clinical Center of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer",10263513,U01DK108314,"['Adult', 'Ancillary Study', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cancer Detection', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Phase', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'County', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enzymes', 'Exocrine pancreas', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Los Angeles', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Natural History', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Pancreatitis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'chronic pancreatitis', 'clinical center', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic diversity', 'imaging modality', 'liquid biopsy', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organizational structure', 'participant retention', 'predictive modeling', 'premalignant', 'recruit', 'response', 'study population', 'treatment trial', 'working group']",NIDDK,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,90342,90419233,0.019408010461393847
"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered nearly every facet of daily life. Although social and physical distancing constraints appear to be slowing the spread of the disease, they may be adversely affecting cancer- related preventive behaviors and accessibility to medical services, including cancer treatment. The impact of such COVID-19 restrictions must be quantified to understand and mitigate short- and long-term effects across the cancer continuum, especially among vulnerable populations, including American Indian adults. The goal of this study is to explore how differences in demographics (e.g., age, sex, educational attainment) may impact engagement in cancer preventive behaviors (e.g., tobacco cessation, cancer screening) and cancer management/survivorship behaviors (e.g., access to cancer treatment services) in the context of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g., social distancing, alterations in work arrangements) by surveying a sample of 1,000 American Indian adults, including those who have never had cancer, cancer patients and cancer survivors. This study will be conducted by the Stephenson Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) program in close coordination with three American Indian tribal nations, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Chickasaw Nation, and Cherokee Nation, and the Oklahoma Area Tribal Epidemiology Center. This goal will be achieved by completing three specific aims: (1) to develop and administer a survey exploring the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cancer prevention and control behaviors. This survey will include a core set of common data elements that will be administered by several NCI-designated Cancer Centers to increase the depth and generalizability of findings; (2) to develop an accurate and robust data integration method using novel machine learning and propensity score weighting approaches to improve the representativeness of the sample of American Indian adults that will be drawn in Oklahoma; and (3) to analyze data to inform tribes, healthcare delivery systems serving American Indian patients, and Stephenson Cancer Center research program members and clinicians regarding how American Indian adults are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will be used to inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the cancer-relevant effects of COVID-19 restrictions in a highly vulnerable group residing within the Stephenson Cancer Center catchment area of Oklahoma. Future iterations of the survey to monitor trends over time are planned. A timeline of COVID-19 related guidance, restrictions or regulatory mandates that have been enacted at the national, state and tribal levels will be constructed to form a context that will allow for meaningful interpretation of findings by tribal community leaders and researchers. The impact of COVID-19 social and physical distancing restrictions on cancer preventive behaviors and access to healthcare, including cancer treatment, must be quantified to understand and mitigate effects of these restrictions on vulnerable groups. The exclusive focus of this study on American Indian adults with and without cancer will provide needed information in a population that may be especially vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant,10149784,P30CA225520,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Center Support Grant', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cherokee Indian', 'Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma', 'Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Community Surveys', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Occupations', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Probability Samples', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Distance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Time trend', 'TimeLine', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tribes', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'college', 'data integration', 'demographics', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment services', 'tribal Nation', 'tribal community', 'tribal health', 'urban residence']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,P30,2020,145000,69391728,0.04633724512251048
"Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery. The large volumes of data that EHRs contain could constitute an important resource for research and quality improvement, but to date, EHRs have not fully realized this potential. Important clinical endpoints, such as disease histology, stage, response, progression, and burden, are often recorded in the EHR only in unstructured free-text form. Even when structured data are available, they may be recorded only at one point in time, such as diagnosis, and may not be as relevant later in a patient's dynamic disease trajectory. These barriers prevent scalable analysis of EHR data for even relatively straightforward research tasks, such as identification of a cohort of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials. Identifying patients for trials is an important challenge in cancer research, since under 5% of adults with cancer have historically enrolled in therapeutic trials. Tools are in development to better match patients to trials, but no such tools are both publicly available and capable of incorporating time- specific patient phenotypes generated using unstructured EHR data. Recent rapid innovation in deep learning techniques could provide novel solutions to these challenges. In ongoing work, I have found that natural language processing based on a neural network architecture can reliably extract clinically relevant oncologic endpoints from free-text radiology reports. My goal is to develop an independent research program focused on leveraging such methods to put the EHR to use at scale for discovery and improving cancer care delivery. My specific aims are (1) to develop and validate a clinically relevant, dynamic, pre-trained cancer trajectory model by applying deep learning to integrated structured and unstructured EHR data; (2) to apply transfer learning to a pre-trained cancer trajectory model to match patients to clinical trials using EHR data and clinical trial protocols; and (3) to pilot the incorporation of cancer trajectory modeling into an institutional clinical trial matching tool. In the near term, this work will facilitate accrual to clinical trials at our institution. During the independent research portion of the proposal, it will constitute the basis for a general framework for conducting scalable cancer research using EHR data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electronic health records (EHRs) are now ubiquitous in routine cancer care delivery, but their utility for research and quality improvement has been limited by a dearth of methods for integrating the unstructured data in which most key cancer outcomes are encoded within EHRs. I propose to apply recent innovations in deep learning to integrate structured and unstructured data to create a dynamic pre-trained model of cancer patients' treatment trajectories, and to apply this model to identify patients who are appropriate candidates for clinical trials at times when they are eligible. I will then evaluate the effect of trajectory modeling on clinical trial accrual as I prepare for an independent research career focused on clinical cancer data science.",Deep clinical trajectory modeling to optimize accrual to cancer clinical trials,9880481,K99CA245899,"['Academia', 'Adult', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical trial protocol document', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer care', 'cancer clinical trial', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'multiple data types', 'neoplasm registry', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'palliative', 'patient population', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'structured data', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'unstructured data']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,170176,174094914,0.025959170694966838

"CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement Abstract  This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. This is a supplement to U54 CA242646, “California-Mexico-Puerto Rico Partnership (CAMPO) Center for Prevention of HPV-related Cancer in HIV+ Populations”. The parent grant's focus is to perform research on reducing the risk of cervical and anal cancer in men and women living with HIV in Latin America. CAMPO Study 1 will enroll 4000 women and 1000 men living with HIV to optimize screening algorithms to detect cervical and anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The incidence of anal cancer is high among all groups of Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among those in Puerto Rico (PR). HPV infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of anal HSIL and cancer. The goal of this supplement is to elucidate the role of the anal microbiome as a contributor to this increased risk of anal cancer risk in these high-risk populations. Specific aims are 1) Study the relationship between anal high- risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and PR; and 2) Study the relationship between anal HSIL and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV infection. These populations are of particular interest given their divergent lifestyles but similarity in genetic background. We hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH without anal HSIL, the microbiome will be different among those with and without hr-HPV infection. We hypothesize that the proportion with pro-inflammatory-mediating taxa will be highest among the PR population compared with the Mexican and California populations given the higher incidence in anal cancer in PR. We also hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV at the 3 locations, detection of HSIL will be associated with a pro-inflammatory microbiome and a decrease in butyrate-producing signatures, with the proportion with pro-inflammatory changes highest in PR compared with the other populations.  We will enroll 100 PLWH (50 men and 50 women) at each of the PR, Mexico City and San Francisco CAMPO sites, for a total of 300 Hispanic PLWH. Data on anal HPV, anal cytology and anal HSIL will be available through CAMPO Study 1 in PR and Mexico City, and from the San Francisco ANCRE Clinic, where PLWH are screened for anal HSIL as part of routine clinical care. A validated food frequency questionnaire in Spanish will be administered to assess dietary intake for the previous 3 and 6 months. Anal swab specimens will be retrieved from the CAMPO Biorepository and used for microbiome analysis. The 16S gene will be amplified from extracted anal swab genomic DNA and subjected to Illumina Miseq. Sequences of the 16S gene V4 region will be analyzed in QIIME2. Random forest classification will be performed to understand how our predictors, i.e. microbiome variables (diversity measurements, species-level taxa) and other covariates (sociodemographics, sex, diet, clinical data, etc.), are associated with hr-HPV infection or HSIL (outcomes). Narrative As the incidence of anal cancer is high in Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially in Puerto Rico, this supplement aims to study the relationship between anal high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and Puerto Rico (PR). Building on the parent U54 California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium infrastructure, we will enroll 300 Hispanic PLWH from the study sites, collect anal swabs for anal HPV testing, cytology and microbiome analysis, perform high resolution anoscopy and collect data to assess dietary intake. The anal microbiota profiles will be analyzed among the three Hispanic populations and will shed light on the role of the anal microbiome in potentiating anal HPV-related anal disease in these high- risk populations.",CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement,10166395,U54CA242646,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Biopsy', 'Butyrates', 'California', 'Cervical', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Latin America', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncoproteins', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Puerto Rico', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'biobank', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cervical and anal cancer', 'clinical care', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'interest', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'microbiota profiles', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'therapeutic vaccine']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2020,194934,685608202,-0.056553498856346425
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed.

Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",10019477,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,200000,511185245,0.017954574370364303
"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9850957,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,210481,111231681,0.00449572108342199
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,136810522,0.006724376020201728
"Validation of a lab-free low-cost screening test for prevention of cervical cancer: automated visual evaluation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize medicine by improving productivity, reducing human error, and assisting with diagnosis and treatment. Image classification algorithms can be used to develop automated visual evaluation (AVE): a potential game-changer for cervical cancer prevention in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). AVE technology reads digital photographs of a cervix to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations in seconds. AVE is a true point of care test, low cost and does not require a laboratory. AVE could be used either for stand-alone primary screening, or to triage HPV-positive women. We will compare AVE to common screening methods in LMICs: visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and conventional cytology. Enhanced Visual Assessment (EVA) System by MobileODT is a cloud-connected mobile colposcope on a smartphone platform. It is FDA cleared and used in 42 countries. MobileODT is uniquely poised to integrate AVE into the EVA System. Our aim is to validate and commercialize AVE on the EVA platform. Phase I aims will adapt AVE to run on the EVA system using an optimal neural network architecture, running either directly on the phone or as a cloud- based service. Phase II is a prospective clinical trial of 10,000 patients recruited at ministry of health sites in El Salvador. All screen-positive patients, and 10% of negative patients, will undergo colposcopy with biopsy. Sensitivity of AVE as a primary screening test will be compared to cytology and to VIA. In HPV-positive women, AVE will be compared to VIA as a triage test. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal involves developing and testing a cervical cancer screening test: automated visual evaluation (AVE) based on an image classification algorithm that runs on smartphone-based colposcope. Included are both technical development to integrate AVE to a mobile phone application (Phase I), and a prospective validation on a screening population of 10,000 women in El Salvador (Phase II). AVE will be compared to standard tests (conventional cytology and visual inspection with acetic acid: VIA) for primary screening, and against VIA triage in an HPV+ population.",Validation of a lab-free low-cost screening test for prevention of cervical cancer: automated visual evaluation,10008280,R44CA247137,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biopsy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Country', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'El Salvador', 'Guidelines', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Oncogenic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'World Health Organization', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'classification algorithm', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'data quality', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital', 'human error', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mobile application', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'overtreatment', 'phase II trial', 'primary endpoint', 'product development', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quality assurance', 'screening', 'screening program', 'secondary analysis', 'secondary endpoint', 'tool']",NCI,"MOBILEODT, INC.",R44,2020,297844,297844,0.0016823985836375314
"Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer ABSTRACT Cervical cancer affects the lives of half a million women worldwide each year. Over half of these women die, even though cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination or early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical pre-cancer. Cervical cancer prevention consists of three visits in the U.S.: 1) screening using the Papanicolaou smear; 2) colposcopy followed by biopsy of cervical abnormalities for women with positive screening results; 3) treatment by excising the lesion using a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) for women with cervical pre-cancer. This three-visit model is not practical for use in medically underserved regions due to the technologies and expertise needed and patient attrition between clinic visits. Our team has already developed a novel Pocket colposcope and machine learning algorithms that when combined provide high-quality, magnified visualization and automated diagnosis with comparable performance to standard-of-care colposcopy. However, screening and diagnosis alone will not lead to decreases in cervical cancer mortality if access to point-of-care treatment is limited. Recently, the thermocoagulator has gained acceptance for ablation of cervical pre-cancer lesions as it does not require consumables (continuous supply of pressurized liquid nitrogen for cryotherapy) or a stable power supply (for LEEP). However, low-cost thermocoagulators have frequent failures based on reports of field-testing and the more reliable versions cost more than $10k. To address these well-documented shortcomings, our group is working to establish a low-cost ablative therapy using a ubiquitous agent, ethanol to treat cervical pre-cancer. While ethanol ablation has a long history of clinical use, its direct injection into tissue leads to non-uniform distribution and hence low efficacy in the region of interest. We propose a new formulation of ethanol using a polymer called ethyl cellulose (generally regarded as safe by the FDA), which will act as a slow release gel without off target toxicity, and an automated injector to control delivery of ethanol-ethyl cellulose (EEC) into the region of interest. The goal of this Phase I SBIR grant is to establish controlled delivery of EEC for cervical pre-cancer treatment using a combination of tissue surrogates and ex vivo and in vivo models of the swine cervix to induce a zone of necrosis that is consistent with thermocoagulation, a commonly used ablation method. In Aim 1, an automated needle injector will be designed for reproducible EEC delivery in tissue surrogates by maximizing the ratio of distributed to injected volume and minimizing back flow and crack formation. In Aim 2, the automated needle injector will be tested in ex vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution of the agent within the defined region of interest and also to determine the number of injections needed to achieve optimal coverage. In Aim 3, the injector safety and efficacy will be tested in in vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution volume and zone of necrosis caused by EEC. The results from the Phase I SBIR will set the foundation for development of alpha and beta versions of the automated needle injector, quality control assessment and packaging of the EEC injectate, and submission of an IND for EEC to the FDA. The goal of this SBIR is for PIs from academic and small business institutions to work in partnership to develop a technological strategy that will transform treatment of cervical pre-cancer in low-resource communities. The proposed research is significantly relevant to public health, as the developed technologies will contribute to the improvement of cervical cancer prevention, and thus a reduction in the mortality rate of this imminently preventable disease.",Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer,10140866,R43CA257303,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cellulose', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cold Therapy', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Ethanol', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Field Reports', 'Fluorescein', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Needles', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Power Sources', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stains', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Vaccination', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'cervical biopsy', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cost', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'field study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preclinical study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'screening', 'standard of care']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R43,2020,300000,300000,0.03142915966894601
"I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges Project Summary Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among older adults in the United States. However, despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer- related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. Barriers to appropriate screening are even greater for groups facing long-standing screening disparities, such as racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES). Key drivers of screening underutilization are decision-making biases facing clinicians and patients, highlighting the need for scalable solutions that are designed to address these biases and tailored to overcome barriers facing high-risk patients.  Nudges, interventions designed using behavioral economic principles, improve behavior by addressing biases that lead to suboptimal decisions. Our team has extensive experience working with health systems to test and scale nudge interventions to overcome decision-making biases facing patients and/or clinicians. We have also demonstrated how these types of nudges can improve health care value and patient outcomes. Since electronic health records (EHRs) have been adopted by more than 90% of clinicians in the US, it is an ideal platform upon which to deploy large scale behavior change nudge interventions.  In this study, we propose to personalize nudge interventions to clinicians and patients, with a focus on how to tailor nudges to the needs of high-risk patients and how to implement promising nudges to improve cancer screening among older adults. We will pilot this work at Penn Medicine and then implement a pragmatic trial at sites in the Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health systems.  In the R61 phase, we will complete the following aims at Penn Medicine: analyze EHR and claims data and identify characteristics and subgroups of patients at high-risk for not completing cancer screening (Aim 1), test the feasibility of individual nudge interventions within an EHR nudge toolkit (Aim 2), and pilot test nudge interventions to identify the most promising approaches to increase cancer screening rates for high-risk patients in each subgroup (Aim 3).  In the R33 phase, we will achieve the following aims at Penn Medicine, University Hospitals, and Sutter Health: conduct a two-arm pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of personalized EHR-based nudges to clinicians and patients on increasing cancer screening rates (Aim 1), evaluate if EHR-based nudge interventions reduce disparities in cancer screening rates for racial/ethnic minorities and patients with low socioeconomic status (Aim 2), and inform future design of tailored EHR interventions by examining heterogeneity of treatment response with respect to clinician and patient characteristics (Aim 3). Project Narrative Despite established guidelines supporting appropriate cancer screening in order to prevent death and adverse cancer-related outcomes, screening is often underutilized. In this project, we will pilot nudge interventions among older adults – including racial/ethnic minorities, low SES individuals, and other high-risk groups identified using novel analytic methods – and tailor nudges to overcome screening barriers facing these patient groups. We will then conduct a pragmatic, multisite trial evaluating the ability for tailored nudges to clinicians and patients to improve vaccination rates and reduce disparities in care.",I-SCREEN: Increasing Screening for Cancer using a Randomized Evaluation of EHR-based Nudges,10050712,R61AG068947,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medicine', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Vaccination', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'cancer health disparity', 'clinical care', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'cost', 'design', 'discounting', 'disparity reduction', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness testing', 'end of life', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care disparity', 'health care settings', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'intervention cost', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient subsets', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'racial and ethnic', 'scale up', 'screening', 'screening disparities', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R61,2020,329875,593605914,0.014510938718650635
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9869938,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,356700,90710179,-0.0011906772333137297
"Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals ABSTRACT Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people face a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. Although there is a growing body of literature on the unique health issues among TGNC populations, they remain severely underserved as existing data on TGNC health are scarce. Under-reporting is common due to issues related to social and economic marginalization, stigma, and discrimination, leading to challenges in obtaining population-based estimates since TGNC individuals are often unwilling to self-identify and reluctant to participate in traditional surveys. Further, past TGNC research has primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. There is limited data available on age-related chronic conditions such as cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, cancer is one of the top research priorities among the TGNC population. With a rapidly growing aging TGNC population, there is an urgent need to characterize the cancer burden among these individuals and understand how cancer impact them differentially compared to non-TGNC individuals. On the other hand, rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has made longitudinal clinical data available for research. EHRs contain not only important structured data, such as demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but also unstructured clinical narratives such as physician’s notes. More than 80 percent of the clinical information is documented in clinical narratives, which contain more detailed patient information including gender identity and cancer risk factors. Motivated by these observations and built upon our previous studies on 1) the adequacy of TGNC gender identity terms, 2) clinical natural language processing methods for information extraction, and 3) EHR-based cohort studies, we propose to conduct a population-based cohort analysis to examine the cancer burden and risk factors among TGNC people using a unique data source from a large network of EHRs—OneFlorida, one of the 13 PCORI-funded clinical data research networks (CDRNs) contributing to the PCORnet. Using both structured and unstructured OneFlorida data, we will first develop computable phenotypes to identify TGNC individuals and subsequently evaluate their cancer risk. Our research is significant because: 1) no population-based cohort studies on cancer risk have been conducted among the TGNC population. Our results will support the development of tailored, evidence- based cancer screening programs for TGNC people; 2) our research will create a cohort of TGNC people that can be not only tracked longitudinally in EHR but also recruited for future clinical studies; and 3) working with a PCORnet CDRN makes our analysis framework generalizable to the overall PCORNet. Overall, the proposed research will advance our knowledge in cancer among the aging TGNC population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of cancer burden and risk factors in transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people, a sexual and gender minority (SGM) group. A computable phenotype that can accurately identify TGNC cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor TGNC health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as cancer. Built upon this work, our future work can focus on building informatics tools to support the long-term surveillance and health monitoring of SGMs using large-scale national networks of EHRs.",Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals,10056679,R21CA245858,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Burden', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coin', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hormone use', 'Hospitals', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer statistics', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'gender nonconforming', 'health care service organization', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'informatics tool', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population based', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening program', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'stem', 'structured data', 'study population', 'transgender']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,392115,188894159,0.04244332187511978
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,377931988,0.014372992997688615
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,9885223,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,447500,327644200,-0.03110074178423698
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9940707,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,450262,148463823,0.04319223413481234
"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix.

"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10031384,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,580599,338121506,0.015490341332187818
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9994228,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'pharmacovigilance', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2020,618291,135644722,0.05728676534816243
"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,9923630,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2020,715682,19252132,0.017509674987184747
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9979779,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,745481,228951281,0.05040603243629254
"A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique Invasive cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience almost 90% of the global cervical-cancer burden, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiencing the highest rates of cervical cancer. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which also disproportionately affects SSA, greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization now has a call-to-action for the elimination of cervical cancer, which includes vaccination young adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV), the obligate viral cause of cervical cancer, and screening mid-adult women for the early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities before becoming cancerous. However, both the best strategy for treating cervical abnormalities in women living with HIV (WLWH) from SSA and how to mitigate treatment failures are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the treatment effectiveness of two ablative methods of treatment, gas-based cryotherapy and thermocoagulation, for treatment of CIN2/3 and high-risk HPV in WLWH women. Eligible, confirmed WLWH women (n=5,014), ages 25-49 years, and living in Maputo, Mozambique, in conjunction with the local PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) program, will be recruited to participate in this trial when attending their routine HIV-care visit. Consenting WLWH will be screened by rapid, point-of-care hrHPV DNA testing, unaided visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA), and “deep learning”-derived, automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithm applied to a digital image captured on a cell phone, thereby ensuring that most CIN2/3 in the population is identified and treated. Screen-positive (HPV, VIA, 6-mo AVE positive) women will be 1) randomly assigned to either the GBC or thermocoagulation, 2) undergo a rigorous colposcopic evaluation and biopsies to determine the (post-hoc) diagnosis of the cervical abnormality, and 3) undergo their assigned treatment if ablation eligibility or LEEP if ineligible based on WHO guidelines8. Adverse events and pain data will be collected systematically during the treatment visit and during an at-home, one month post-treatment visit by community health workers. Six- and 18-month follow-up visits will be used to assess effectiveness of these treatments against CIN2/3 and hrHPV. Nested studies will evaluate whether 1) specific HPV genotypes, CD4 and HIV viral load, and/or lesion size, location, and severity (i.e. imperfect adherence to WHO guidelines), are risk factors for treatment failures by each method and 2) deep-learning algorithms applied to digital images can predict ablative treatment failures and thereby used in the future to triage screen-positive women to LEEP instead of ablation and thereby potentially be avoided those treatment failures. Secondary analyses will assess the effectiveness of 12 different S&T strategies based on different combinations of 6 screening methods (hrHPV with no triage, hrHPV with triage using HPV genotype groups, hrHPV with VIA triage, hrHPV with AVE triage, VIA alone, or AVE alone) and two ablative methods. Project Narrative Women living in sub-Saharan Africa with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at the greatest risk of getting and dying from cervical cancer. The proposed study will compare two methods of treating cervical abnormalities for the prevention of cervical cancer in Mozambican women living with HIV. Goals of the study are to identify the best treatment and reduce treatment failures in these women.",A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique,9927140,R01CA239921,"['Ablation', 'Acetic Acids', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervical dysplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Cold Therapy', 'Community Health Aides', 'Consent', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electricity', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Generations', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Hand', 'Health Priorities', 'Home environment', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Local anesthesia', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mozambique', 'Necrosis', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Pain', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Speculums', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Topical application', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Triage', 'Vaccination', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'alternative treatment', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'global health', 'health training', 'light weight', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mortality', 'point of care', 'portability', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'treatment comparison', 'virtual']",NCI,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,888392,199779478,-0.05722929344484477
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,10124519,R44CA240022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Callback', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'success', 'symposium', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,919121,919121,-0.04516673257044159
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records Summary Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research. Relevance We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients.

"Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools  The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) 2019 symposium hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) identified “a critical need to collect, analyze, and share data to address the burden of cancer in children, adolescents and young adults”. Currently, cancer registries in the U.S. hold structured information on every cancer case, including pediatric cancers, within their respective catchment areas. For childhood cancer patients and survivors, issues of late effects, recurrence, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), and follow-up are critically important to consider and further study. It is also important to address survivors’ life trajectories, which often include moving to different states and away from where their data was initially collected.   The aim of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is to build a connected data infrastructure that includes longitudinal data from multiple sources and enables secure sharing of childhood cancer data with vetted research investigators. These efforts will support childhood cancer research and provide a population-level dataset on all childhood cancer patients. As a base for the infrastructure, data currently collected at targeted cancer registries, including those in the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) program, will be used to aggregate key information on childhood cancer patients and survivors. In addition to registry data, NCCR aims to incorporate unique data sources including the National Death Index (NDI), State vital records, LexisNexis (residential history and social determinants of health data), and Virtual Pooled Registry (VPR) data on subsequent primaries, as well as pharmacy and radiation oncology data. Additional categories of information that may be integrated into the database include detailed diagnostic characterization of the tumor, treatment information, indicators of tumor recurrence, identification of multiple primary cancers, and genomic characterization of initial and potentially recurrent disease.   The Department of Energy (DOE)/Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest multipurpose science laboratory in the DOE national laboratory system. The mission of ORNL is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions to meet pressing global challenges aligned with the DOE’s goals. This “science-to-solutions” mission depends on the integration and application of distinctive capabilities in basic and applied research, which include leadership positions and capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC), advanced visualization and data fusion, and computational science and systems engineering and integration. ORNL is recognized as a leader in the research and development of health and data sciences. In the DOE national laboratory system, ORNL has a highly capable and proven data and computing enclave certified to host and analyze protected health information (PHI). ORNL’s capabilities, certified systems that accommodate PHI, HPC capabilities and facilities, and the technical expertise that has proven successful in a recent multi-year project with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) and its broader engagement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are unmatched in the domestic private sector, making ORNL uniquely qualified to perform the work required for this effort.    With growing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the national cancer surveillance program faces increasing challenges in capturing essential information needed to better understand the effectiveness of cancer treatments in the context of our complex medical and social environment. The capacity to collect automatically and comprehensively information about cancer patients would enhance the ability of cancer registry data to support a broad variety of cancer research and would provide an infrastructure that would permit evaluation of the generalizability of cancer diagnostics and therapies outside the clinical trials setting to the 97%  of the general population not covered by clinical trials. These advances will be important in future healthcare applications beyond cancer, and the knowledge gained will be directly related to technology for future HPC architectures and for making HPC more available to biomedical research.  The Current DOE collaboration with NIH/NCI, known as the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer, has produced several useful tools and documentation which have been utilized by the cancer surveillance community for adult cancer populations. In particular, ORNL has developed deep learning models and modalities of data analytics that are of particular interest to the NCCR. Their expertise and development of various tools using information from multiple data sources can be used to support various data queries, provide assessment of feasibility of developing trials, and enabling comparisons of key characteristics among the entire population of childhood cancer patients at a population level to compare to patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. Children’s Oncology Group [COG]). Furthermore, their expertise and computing capabilities will enable NCI to refine and develop scaling mechanisms of existing data extraction algorithms to obtain data from text documentation in pediatric cancer abstracts that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.    This infrastructure will serve as the central data index and warehouse for childhood cancer data through large-scale data identification and linkages and has the potential to provide real-world evidence to support data-driven clinical guidelines. These developed tools combined with this data infrastructure will also support a broad range of research questions. Through the shared follow-up information across registries and other data linkage sources, annual follow-up data will be greatly enhanced for childhood cancer survivors and pediatric oncology research.  The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding to 1) support the development and refinement of advanced computational tools (e.g., artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, graph analytics, text extraction algorithms, predictive modeling, and other advanced computational methodologies) using key data from the NCCR infrastructure and various other external data sources, and 2) utilize NCCR to further refine existing tools developed by DOE/ORNL. n/a",Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools ,10281416,PC20005001,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Catchment Area', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Late Effects', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Private Sector', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SEER Program', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'computerized tools', 'data fusion', 'data infrastructure', 'data registry', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'large scale data', 'multiple data sources', 'neoplasm registry', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'social health determinants', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,Y01,2020,1000000,0,0.03379614379812824
"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10216917,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2020,4506756,614137041,0.02966849418781516
"Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing Project Summary/Abstract Cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are low-income and never/underscreened (never screened or under screened) especially in Indiana, where cervical cancer incidence and mortality are higher than the US national average, and screening is lower than the US national average. Women who are low- income have structural and intrapersonal barriers to screening that may prevent them from obtaining provider- based screening. Although HPV testing is now accepted by USPTF guidelines, it is only endorsed for provider- collected sampling. Self-sampling for HPV testing, a method for women to collect their own cervico-vaginal sample, has been established as a feasible and acceptable alternative to provider-based cervical cancer screening in other countries and is supported by US pilot studies. HPV self-sampling is likely to be implemented as a screening option in the US in the future due to its comparable sensitivity to provider- collected HPV samples, acceptability, and potential to reach populations who are never/underscreeners. Self- sampling may overcome barriers to provider-based cervical cancer screening experienced by women who are low-income and never/underscreened and provide a convenient way to access screening. Studies testing mailed HPV kits, however, have demonstrated that 30-50% of women do not return a mailed HPV kit. Prior to widespread implementation, research is needed to identify characteristics of returners and non-returners of mailed HPV self-sampling kits. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify factors associated with mailed return of HPV self-sampling kits using concepts from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self-efficacy) while controlling for sociodemographic, healthcare, and health behavior variables in a group of low-income and never/underscreened women. Data for this cross-sectional study will be collected at time of study consent from women (n=200) at a food pantry and nonadherent to cervical cancer screening using valid and reliable instruments. Self-sampling kits will be mailed to the women’s home within one week of consent, and women will have 4 weeks to return the kit to be considered “returners”. Logistic regression analyses will be used to analyze the relationship between the data collected at baseline consent (attributes of innovation-advantages, compatibility, complexity, and self- efficacy) and return of the self-sampling kit via mail (y/n). The results of this study will provide knowledge about factors associated with return of self-sampling kits to better understand the characteristics of returners and non-returners. Results of this project will help guide implementation of HPV self-sampling in populations who are low-income and never/underscreened whom self- sampling may most likely benefit. This study will provide a foundation for the applicant’s long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer through increasing cervical cancer screening rates with an innovative technology, self-sampling for HPV testing. Project Narrative Women who are low-income and never/underscreeners are unequally burdened by cervical cancer. This study will be one of the first to identify factors associated with mailed return of a cervical cancer screening tool, self- sampling for HPV self-testing, that will provide an alternative to traditional cervical screening by removing barriers for women most at risk for cervical cancer (women who are low-income and never/underscreeners).",Factors Associated with Mailed Return of Self-Sampling for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Testing,9835517,F31NR018791,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Appointment', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consent', 'Country', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Failure', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Indiana', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Netherlands', 'Nurses', 'Pain', 'Pap smear', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Provider', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time Study', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Woman', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cost effective', 'experience', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'theories', 'therapy development']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2019,32086,232986943,0.04385373906571688
"Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test ABSTRACT The HPV vaccine is highly effective in clinical trials, with an absolute risk of persistent (6+ months) infection with vaccine-type high-risk HPV of only 1.4% among vaccinated women. As prevalence of HPV infection decreases, the risk of false positive cervical cancer screening results increases. However, current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Data cannot be extrapolated from other countries with different HPV vaccination coverage, as cross-protection against non- vaccine type HPV infection varies by population vaccination rates, and are likely to affect screening test performance. Major challenges in development of new U.S. guidelines are anticipated for the following reasons: 1) large U.S. population-based data on HPV infection rates and cervical cancer screening test statistics are currently not available, and likely vary by regional vaccination rates; 2) most studies evaluating cervical cancer screening results in vaccinated women do not differentiate between those who have received only 1 dose of the vaccine and those who have completed the 2-3 dose series; 3) few studies have evaluated differences in outcomes by age at HPV vaccine initiation or interval between doses. The overarching aim of the proposed research is to determine an optimal cervical cancer screening strategy for women vaccinated against HPV. The objectives of this pilot research are to 1) determine if the prevalence of cervical dysplasia has decreased with HPV vaccination and resultantly changed the PPV of cervical cancer screening tests, and 2) determine if cervical cancer screening test performance varies by age at HPV vaccine initiation, number of doses, or interval between HPV vaccine doses. Aim1: Determine if the decrease in prevalence of cervical dysplasia among vaccinated women has resulted in a decrease in the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare cervical cancer screening and diagnostic test results among HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated women. Positive predictive values for positive HPV tests and abnormal cytology results to predict high-grade dysplasia will be compared by HPV vaccination status. Aim2: Determine if cervical cancer screening test accuracy varies by age at vaccine initiation, number of doses received, and/or interval between doses. The positive predictive value of positive HPV tests and abnormal Pap test results among vaccinated women will be compared by the number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2+), age at vaccine initiation, and interval between doses using logistic regression. Project Narrative Current cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate between women who have and have not been vaccinated to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. United States data to inform changes to cervical cancer screening guidelines for vaccinated women are urgently needed to ensure that harms of screening these women at low risk for cancer do not outweigh the benefits. The results of this research will provide an estimate of the positive predictive value of cervical cancer screening tests (Pap tests, HPV tests) post-vaccination, and define a population of women who are adequately vaccinated (based on age at vaccine initiation, number of vaccine doses, and interval between doses) to benefit from what will likely be decreased cervical cancer screening without significant increase in cancer risk.",Optimizing cervical cancer screening for HPV-vaccinated women: Evaluation of post-vaccination cervical cancer screening test,9806021,R03HS026982,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R03,2019,54765,340417756,0.052943084446378866
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9720681,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,161230,533594881,0.04319223413481234
"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9668002,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,172270,111231681,0.00449572108342199
"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women Abstract In the United States in 2016, an estimated 600,000 people will die from cancer and 1.7 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed. Considering the life span, almost 40% of women and men will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lifetime. Understanding amenable risk factors that contribute to this large public health burden is essential. Observational studies consistently indicate associations between self-reported physical activity and increased risk of many types of cancer, especially breast cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the amount, intensity, duration, and types of physical activity required to reduce cancer risk, especially for older women. Sedentary behavior may provide a more feasible intervention target, especially for older adults. However, even less is known about sedentary behavior and cancer risk. To date, no prospective studies have examined accelerometry-derived physical activity and sedentary behavior to risk of incident cancer outcomes. Advances have been made in new measurement methods by our team, but have not been applied to health outcomes to assess their value. In this application, we propose to assemble accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior and cancer incident events and deaths from two cohort studies of women: the Women's Health Study (WHS) and the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Study. We will apply sophisticated, yet directly interpretable, methods to determine which physical activity and sedentary behavior features are most important for reducing cancer risk among more than 22,000 women 63 to 101 years of age. For both cohorts, one-week of accelerometry data were collected in a similar manner during 2011-2014. Follow-up of both cohorts for adjudicated cancer outcomes is planned through 2020 and likely beyond. We propose three aims. Aim 1 will apply novel and translational measures of accelerometry- assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using latent class analysis, an activity index, and machine learning algorithms of raw accelerometry data for use in Aims 2 and 3. We will then investigate the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity (Aim 2) and sedentary behavior (Aim 3) to overall and site-specific (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) incident and fatal cancer. This cost-efficient study will investigate in detail whether and how patterns of frequency, duration, intensity, bouts, and type of physical activity and sedentary behavior predict cancer outcomes. Identification of new cancer-protective patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention, can be used in interventions to reduce risk, and could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses in physical activity and sedentary behavior interventions. Project Narrative We will develop novel exposure metrics to determine the association of accelerometry-assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior to overall and site-specific incident and fatal cancer. This cost efficient project will provide much-needed evidence to inform physical activity and sedentary behavior guidelines for disease prevention in older women. Our findings can be applied to intervention studies to reduce risk. The exposure developments made from this project could revolutionize the monitoring of human responses to physical activity and sedentary behavior.","Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Cancer Incidence in Women",9661385,R01CA227122,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Breast', 'Cause of Death', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratory Study', 'Leisures', 'Light', 'Light Exercise', 'Longevity', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'adjudicate', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older women', 'response', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sex', 'vigorous intensity', 'young adult']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,200000,511185245,0.017954574370364303
"Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of cancer mortality. Early detection of breast cancer can reduce mortality and morbidity, which has led to widespread mammography screening, recommended for women ages 50-74 on a yearly or bi-yearly basis. Reading the mammogram images to decide if cancer may be present is difficult due to the rarity of occurrence – in a screening population, 99.5% of women do not have cancer – and the visual challenge of finding what can be a very subtle abnormality on a complex background. This difficulty, combined with the high volume of mammograms – 39 million per year in the US – has led to a variety of proffered solutions including software known as computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Despite early promise, such solutions have not fulfilled their potential in improving outcomes and are largely thought to increase interpretation times. Productivity is increasingly a concern due to the rapidly growing use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT or “3D” mammography), which has demonstrated higher cancer detection rates than traditional 2D mammography, but also takes much longer to interpret. As a potential solution, there has been significant interest in applying deep learning to mammography. Deep learning (DL) is a powerful field of machine learning which learns image features in an end-to-end fashion from data, and has been used to achieve human level performance on a number of imaging pattern recognition tasks. This proposal seeks to create DL-based software for mammography that can be effective in a clinical setting through (1) accurate and robust predictions on a diverse population of patients, (2) interpretable results from the DL model (no “black box” answers), and (3) applicability to both 2D mammography and DBT. In Phase I, the aim is to improve model performance by training on additional data and incorporating additional algorithmic advances. Phase I will conclude with a clinical reader study comparing performance of the software to radiologists. In Phase II, the aim is to improve the clinical effectiveness of the software by automating quality detection, incorporating prior exams into the model, and expanding the training dataset to ensure results generalize to any woman eligible for screening mammography. These improvements will apply to both 2D and DBT. Achieving the desired performance levels will enable a product that will improve productivity for radiologists and ensure consistent and accurate interpretations for patients. Success in this project would be a large step towards translating state-of- the-art artificial intelligence to clinically effective tools for screening mammography. Project Narrative Though mammography screening is widely considered beneficial for women ages 50-74, the varied challenges with reading the images lead to missed cancers or over-diagnosis, which in turn result in shorter length of life or unnecessary invasive procedures for many women. The goal of this project is use recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence to create a tool for doctors that will help them interpret mammograms more accurately and efficiently. These improvements will enable better outcomes for women by improving access to quality mammography interpretations, especially in resource-constrained areas.",Towards Clinically Effective AI for Screening Mammography,9847578,R44CA240022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Callback', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Improve Access', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical development', 'commercialization', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'patient population', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'success', 'symposium', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NCI,"DEEPHEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,252810,919121,-0.04516673257044159
"Identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource community cancer settings using an innovative informatics solution PROJECT SUMMARY . Hereditary cancer risk assessment in low-resource community cancer settings is a signiﬁcant unmet clinical need. Unfortunately, most community cancer clinics do not have adequate access to genetics expertise and patients are not systematically assessed for hereditary risk. New cost-eﬀective and practical approaches are needed to assess and identify patients at risk for hereditary cancer community cancer settings where rural, minority, and underserved patients receive cancer care. ItRunsInMyFamily, Inc and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have partnered to develop ItRunsInMyFamily.com (ItRuns), a simple, scalable informatics tool that uses artiﬁcial intelligence and social networking to collect family health history from patients and assess for hereditary cancer risk. For this project we will develop a functional prototype and demonstrate feasibility of ItRuns as a simple, low-cost approach for identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource, community cancer settings.

"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9658032,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,356700,90710179,-0.0011906772333137297
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools.

"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,9731187,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2019,608348,19252132,0.017509674987184747
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9749060,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,733691,228951281,0.05040603243629254

"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10047552,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2019,3250000,614137041,0.02966849418781516
"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As a result, genetic counseling and testing is increasingly recommended for AYAs with new cancer diagnoses so that screening for new cancers can take place; however, no AYA-specific models for cancer risk communication and decision-making have been developed. The proposed study will develop and test a novel, patient- and family-centered model for cancer risk communication and decision-making to meet the unique needs of AYAs.",The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes,9848695,U01CA243688,"['Access to Information', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Attention', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychology', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Counseling', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic screening method', 'Goals', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare', 'Hereditary Malignant Neoplasm', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Screening for cancer', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'chatbot', 'child bearing', 'computer program', 'design', 'education resources', 'effectiveness trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic counselor', 'genetic information', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'oncology', 'patient portal', 'programs', 'psychological distress', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'reproductive', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'screening guidelines']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,U01,2019,3543148,174094914,0.022078271544087143
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9648208,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,34680,533594881,0.04319223413481234
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research.

The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9789497,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2018,79500,135644722,0.05728676534816243
"Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog PROJECT SUMMARY The current proposal, submitted to the special funding opportunity for Administrative Supplements for Integrative Data Analysis to Extend Research in Cancer Control and Population Sciences (NOT-CA-18-087), leverages the unique and rich data resource of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) comprising of >55,000 patients recruited at Michigan Medicine with complete array-based whole-genome genotyping data that are connected to rich longitudinal data retrieved from their electronic health records. In addition, we have access to information on behavioural data collected through a detailed questionnaire and geocoded residence information. These diverse sources of data allow us the possibility of creating novel and more accurate measures of exposures using questionnaire responses, structured and unstructured component of the electronic health record including clinical notes and the geocoded residential information. A key aspect of MGI is its enrichment for cancer outcomes. About 50% of the participants recruited so far have at least one neoplasm diagnosis in their health record. This is due to the recruitment of MGI participants from a perioperative setting. This cancer enrichment sets it apart from other biobanks and presents a unique opportunity at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center for cancer control and population sciences research. Our proposal aspires to establish an analytical framework to distil summary statistics of published genome- wide association studies for cancer into polygenic risk scores, to construct known and novel cancer-related exposures from clinical free text and data mining of geocoded residential data, and to utilize them in a screen for associations across the catalogued medical phenome, the ensemble of clinical diagnoses and biomarkers that are derived from routinely ordered lab tests in MGI. Correlated co-morbidities could, if pre-symptomatic, be used to improve cancer risk prediction, while associated exposures could inform on targeted strategies for cancer prevention and risk stratification. Novel findings will be replicated (when feasible) in the publicly accessible data of the UK Biobank, a population-based study of up to half a million participants. To differentiate between pre-symptomatic and post-treatment features, we will probe the existing time- stamped data of MGI that permit retrospective insights of up to ten years into a participant’s electronic medical records. Since there is an urgent need to better communicate results from such big data exploration with a broad and multi-disciplinary audience, e.g. to inspire follow-up replication and new hypothesis generation in cancer epidemiology and furthering our understanding of susceptibility mechanisms for cancer, we will develop a webpage to allow intuitive and interactive result browsing and open sharing. The proposal showcases the advantage of harmonization, integration of large and complex databases towards impactful research and powerful discovery tools in cancer control and population sciences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resource of the cancer-enriched cohort of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, this unique integrative data analysis proposal attempts to integrate genes, exposure and health history information as archived in an individual’s electronic medical records under a unifying analytic and scientific discovery framework. The ultimate goal is to give shape and structure to disparate sources of data towards principled discovery, inference and prediction. Through the proposed research we hope to achieve improved risk prediction, risk stratification and targeted prevention of cancer. Tools will be developed for wider dissemination of the results via an online visual catalog and make the results from massive, complex and heterogeneous sources of data accessible to other researchers, stakeholders and community participants. The proposal will showcase the potential for discoveries in cancer population-studies using unique data features from MGI, a medical center-based biobank and simultaneously leverage our access to the large population-based biobank, namely the UK Biobank, for replication and confirmation studies. In that sense, the proposal carries out integrative data analysis in two directions: (a) integrated analysis of diverse sources of data within MGI and (b) integrated use of MGI in concert with data from a large publicly available biobank, the UK Biobank.",Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog,9765877,P30CA046592,"['Access to Information', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Archives', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Inherited', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genome', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health record', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplasm registry', 'neoplasm resource', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'population based', 'recruit', 'repository', 'residence', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptom treatment', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web page', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2018,149955,641965656,0.0382378667828583
"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9502260,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'health plan', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,205694,37281765,0.008643090739818393
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9522076,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466230,533594881,0.04319223413481234
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments.

"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9534547,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2018,752888,228951281,0.05040603243629254
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and other factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In making the most important decisions for cancer care, clinicians naturally consider their patients' evolving characteristics and risks factors and tailor the treatments or diagnostic tests accordingly. In other words, they consider dynamic treatment strategies that depend on the evolution of one or more time-dependent covariates (e.g. functional status, frailty, new comorbidities) as opposed to static treatment strategies which do not. Despite the clinical relevance of dynamic treatment strategies, most research continues to compare static strategies. This is because, in part, randomized clinical trials comparing dynamic strategies can be particularly expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Additionally, observational studies of dynamic strategies require specific methods because even in the absence of unmeasured confounding, conventional estimates fail to have a causal interpretation when (i) there exists a measured time-varying prognostic factor that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (ii) past treatment predicts subsequent prognostic factor level. This treatment- confounder feedback is pervasive in biomedical research. This application's broad objective is to create an innovative research program that integrates data from diverse sources such as electronic medical records, administrative claims, epidemiologic cohorts (and in the future wearable health technology and patient portals) with advanced epidemiological methods to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery and create publicly available analytic tools to accelerate discovery and support a more strategic delivery of cancer care. The specific aims involve training in open-source programming, data science and advanced epidemiological methods. These skills will be used to develop three projects that will use different sources of data (a traditional epidemiological cohort, a linkage of tumor registries with claims and electronic medical records) to address questions on prevention, surveillance and treatment of cancer:  • What is the best dynamic strategy for colorectal cancer screening?  • What is the best dynamic strategy for bladder cancer surveillance?  • What is the best dynamic strategy of treatment for prostate cancer patients with a PSA-only relapse? These projects will serve as a backbone to develop and fine tune the specific methods required to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery: the g-methods. Specifically, this application will focus on the application and dissemination of Marginal Structural Models and the parametric g-formula for clinical cancer research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal addresses the systematic application and dissemination of cutting-edge methods (g- methods) for causal inference to clinical cancer research using complex sources of data. G-methods are particularly useful for answering clinical questions where treatments, patient characteristics and outcomes change over time (which is virtually always the case). By tailoring these methods to cancer research and developing open-source analytic platforms, we plan to spread their use across the scientific community and ultimately benefit patient care.",Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care,9314154,K99CA207730,"['Address', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Androgens', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Observational Study', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance Status', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Vertebral column', 'academic program', 'administrative database', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'case-based', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'relational database', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'sound', 'surveillance strategy', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'tumor', 'tumor registry', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2017,137137,146629556,-0.0004265797653786378
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9373907,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,208522,37281765,0.008643090739818393
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9381186,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,362188,533594881,0.04319223413481234

"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9331533,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2017,623596,135644722,0.05728676534816243
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9295773,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2017,766250,228951281,0.05040603243629254
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,9122340,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'racial and ethnic', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,386725,685608202,0.04224477057013117
"Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of cancer pharmacoepidemiology is to identify adverse and/or long-term effects of chemotherapeutic agents and determine the impact of drugs on cancer risk, prevention, and response to treatments. Pharmacoepidemiology studies exert strong influence on defining optimal treatments and accelerating translational research. Therefore, it is imperative for these to be done efficiently and leveraging real-world patient data such as electronic health records (EHR). Massive clinical data from EHRs are being tapped into for research in disease-gene associations, comparative effectiveness and clinical outcomes. There is however paucity in pharmacoepidemiological studies using comprehensive EHR data due to the inherent challenges that exist for data abstraction, handling and analysis. The hurdles include heterogeneity of reports, embedding of detailed clinical information in narrative text, differing EHR platforms across different sites and missing data to name a few. In this study, we propose to integrate and extend preexisting tools to build an informatics infrastructure for EHR data extraction, interpretation, management and analysis to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. We will leverage existing tools of natural language processing (NLP), standardized ontologies and clinical data management systems to extract and manipulate EHR data for cancer pharmacoepidemiological research. To achieve our goal we propose four specific aims. In aim 1, we intend to develop a high-performance, user- centric information extraction framework with advanced features such as active learning (to reduce annotation cost), domain adaptation (to transfer data across multiple sites) and user-friendly interfaces (for non-technical end users). In aim 2, we plan to improve data harmonization across differing platforms, develop components for seamless data export as well as expand methodologies to address impediments inherent to EHR-based data (such as the missing data problem). In aim 3, we will conduct demonstration projects of cancer pharmacoepidemiology including pharmacovigilance and pharmacogenomics of chemotherapeutic agents to evaluate, refine and validate the broad uses of our tools. Finally in aim 4, we propose to disseminate the methods and tools developed in this project to the cancer research and pharmacoepidemiology communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to integrate and extend previously developed tools to build an informatics infrastructure for electronic health records (EHR) data extraction, interpretation, management, and analysis, to advance cancer pharmacoepidemiology research. Such methods can efficiently integrate and standardize cancer pharmacoepidemiology specific information from EHRs across different sites, thus advancing research in this field.            ",Advancing Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology Research Through EHRs and Informatics,9094161,U24CA194215,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'CCL4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medex', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Selection Bias', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data management', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,U24,2016,652772,135644722,0.05728676534816243
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary         research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), the may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults -- more than 16 million people -- who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8786066,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,83928,533594881,0.03332238431609826
"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening. Understanding the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps will inform decisions about the management of these patients and ultimately improve the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.",Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort,8831625,R03CA186215,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biometry', 'Caliber', 'Catchment Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'hazard', 'improved', 'indexing', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor progression']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R03,2015,88000,758431960,0.023091721335813484
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8827726,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,165844,533594881,0.044955117924777174
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8829207,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic approach', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,168280,685608202,-0.018924099527277125
"Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among males and the twelfth most common cancer among females in the United States. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in bladder cancer recurrence, progression and survival have been reported by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Quality gaps and treatment inequity may contribute to outcomes disparities. In contrast to immutable factors such as genetic or anatomic characteristics, treatment inequity represents a modifiable factor. Thus, our study will identify quality gaps in bladder cancer care and elucidate treatment disparities in order to inform future quality improvement interventions. Effective treatments for bladder cancer exist but may be underutilized at all stages of diagnosis. Treatments include the use of intravesical chemotherapy within 24 hours of the initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radical cystectomy. Failure to use intravesical chemotherapy immediately post-tumor resection (and thus to prevent tumor recurrences) has been estimated to cost the United States around $20 million annually. Increasing the use of guideline-consistent care thus has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities while also decreasing healthcare costs. Treatment disparities across patients group have been observed, although findings have not been consistent. Most studies have not comprehensively evaluated bladder cancer care but instead have focused on a few treatment practices, and existing research also may not reflect contemporary treatment patterns. We propose to comprehensively evaluate bladder cancer treatment overall and by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age (Aim 1) and calendar time (Aim 2) in order to identify quality gaps and treatment inequities. Our research team includes an epidemiologist, health economist, two urologists, and a biostatistician/analyst. We will create a retrospective cohort of all patients age 21 years or older diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2001- 2013 within the large, diverse, community-based membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We will use our high-quality cancer registry and rich electronic health record to evaluate care among over 9,000 bladder cancer patients. Treatment practices will be coded as yes/no to indicate adherence to well-established treatment recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to evaluate differences in treatment adherence across patients groups. Poisson regression or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models will be employed to evaluate treatment practices over time. The completion of these aims will provide a detailed comparison of recommended and actual treatment practices by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age, and calendar time for a wide range of bladder cancer treatment recommendations. Future quality         improvement efforts may build upon the results to target the treatment gaps with the greatest potential to reduce disparities and improve care delivery and patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among men and the thirteenth among women, and it is the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in recurrence, progression, and mortality have been reported across different patient groups and may be due in part to variability in treatment use.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cancer Patient', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Cancer History', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nomads', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'age group', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cyber security', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental carcinogenesis', 'experience', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'population migration', 'social', 'social networking website', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,0,0.030818379399150695
"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8930929,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,428238,685608202,0.04224477057013117
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening. Understanding the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps will inform decisions about the management of these patients and ultimately improve the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.            ",Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort,8704474,R03CA186215,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biometry', 'Caliber', 'Catchment Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'hazard', 'improved', 'indexing', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor progression']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R03,2014,88000,758431960,0.023091721335813484
"DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR  Nearly half of all cancers cases might be avoided if people were to engage in healthy lifestyle and early detection behaviors. A central tenet of theories of health behavior is that awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action. Empirical evidence supports the idea that higher perceptions of risk motivate people to engage in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Consequently, an important component of cancer surveillance has been assessing the population's perceptions of risk of developing cancer. Health promotion and education campaigns that seek to promote cancer prevention and early detection behaviors often attempt to increase the public's sense of personal risk of developing cancer. In order to optimize surveillance and develop health education and promotion campaigns that engage those at greatest risk for not engaging in protective behaviors, it is important that we understand the relationship between perceived risk and health behavior for all research respondents. Currently this is not the case. Our research found that at least 16 million people in the U.S. would respond I don't know if asked their perceived risk of developing cancer. Many of these people are members of populations that experience cancer disparities. Little is known about the health behaviors of these individuals because people who respond don't know have typically been dropped from analyses. Thus, these individuals have been systematically excluded from much cancer prevention research. However, if, as our preliminary research suggests, they are unaware of their cancer risk (or unable or unwilling to report it), they may be at increased risk for not engaging in cancer prevention and detection behaviors. Therefore, understanding the relation of don't know responding to engaging in preventive health behavior is a critical research need. To test the hypothesis that don't know responding is associated with lower engagement in cancer prevention and detection behaviors, we will examine the association between don't know responding to risk perception questions and a wide variety of cancer prevention behaviors in 14 large, population-based surveys (i.e., multiple years of NHIS, HINTS, and BRFSS). Specific behaviors include physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, skin protection, HPV vaccination, cancer screening (breast, colorectal, prostate), and, because AIDS is a risk factor for several cancers, HIV testing. Multivariate linear and logistic regression will be used to estimate the relation between don't know responding to perceived risk questions and engaging in a given cancer prevention or early detection behavior, after controlling for demographic characteristics. This research will address a gap in knowledge about the health behaviors of the 7-10% of U.S. adults-more than 16 million people-who respond don't know to cancer risk perception survey questions. The study will also advance our knowledge of why existing intervention approaches may be ineffective for certain populations that experience cancer disparities, as well as identify potential intervention components and target populations for such interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that, when asked about their risk of cancer, over 16 million adults in the U.S. respond I don't know. This study will test whether these individuals are at risk for not engaging in behaviors that prevent and detect cancer, including cancer screening, physical activity, avoiding tobacco, obtaining HPV vaccination, and eating adequate fruits and vegetables. Findings will indicate whether people who respond don't know are a high risk group that may need to be engaged with targeted health education and promotion.            ",DONT KNOW RESPONSES TO PERCEIVED RISK ITEMS:  IMPLICATION FOR HEALTH BEHAVIOR,8633184,R03CA177775,"['AIDS prevention', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Prevention Intervention', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disadvantaged', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Health Promotion and Education', 'Health behavior', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Screening for cancer', 'Skin', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'fruits and vegetables', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'therapy development']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R03,2014,102407,533594881,0.03323988310255435
"Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment  Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer among males and the twelfth most common cancer among females in the United States. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in bladder cancer recurrence, progression and survival have been reported by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age. Quality gaps and treatment inequity may contribute to outcomes disparities. In contrast to immutable factors such as genetic or anatomic characteristics, treatment inequity represents a modifiable factor. Thus, our study will identify quality gaps in bladder cancer care and elucidate treatment disparities in order to inform future quality improvement interventions. Effective treatments for bladder cancer exist but may be underutilized at all stages of diagnosis. Treatments include the use of intravesical chemotherapy within 24 hours of the initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor and use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radical cystectomy. Failure to use intravesical chemotherapy immediately post-tumor resection (and thus to prevent tumor recurrences) has been estimated to cost the United States around $20 million annually. Increasing the use of guideline-consistent care thus has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce disparities while also decreasing healthcare costs. Treatment disparities across patients group have been observed, although findings have not been consistent. Most studies have not comprehensively evaluated bladder cancer care but instead have focused on a few treatment practices, and existing research also may not reflect contemporary treatment patterns. We propose to comprehensively evaluate bladder cancer treatment overall and by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age (Aim 1) and calendar time (Aim 2) in order to identify quality gaps and treatment inequities. Our research team includes an epidemiologist, health economist, two urologists, and a biostatistician/analyst. We will create a retrospective cohort of all patients age 21 years or older diagnosed with bladder cancer during 2001- 2013 within the large, diverse, community-based membership of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). We will use our high-quality cancer registry and rich electronic health record to evaluate care among over 9,000 bladder cancer patients. Treatment practices will be coded as yes/no to indicate adherence to well-established treatment recommendations. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to evaluate differences in treatment adherence across patients groups. Poisson regression or Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models will be employed to evaluate treatment practices over time. The completion of these aims will provide a detailed comparison of recommended and actual treatment practices by patient sex, race/ethnicity, age, and calendar time for a wide range of bladder cancer treatment recommendations. Future quality improvement efforts may build upon the results to target the treatment gaps with the greatest potential to reduce disparities and improve care delivery and patient outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bladder cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer-related mortality among men and the thirteenth among women, and it is the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Disparities in recurrence, progression, and mortality have been reported across different patient groups and may be due in part to variability in treatment use. We will compare recommended and actual treatment practices for bladder cancer by patient sex, race/ethnicity, and age in order to elucidate treatment gaps and disparities, with the underlying goal of informing future quality improvement efforts to improve care delivery and reduce disparities.                ",Trends and Disparities in Bladder Cancer Treatment,8692201,R21CA185931,"['21 year old', 'Adherence', 'African American', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Appointment', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Calendar', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Cystoscopy', 'Cytology', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Funding Agency', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intravesical Administration', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Time', 'Transurethral Resection', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Urologist', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'intravesical', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'older patient', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'treatment adherence', 'trend', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2014,184295,111231681,0.032538982994485766
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.            ",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8690410,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198849,533594881,0.044955117924777174
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.            ",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8681246,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'PC3 cell line', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,201953,685608202,-0.018924099527277125
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US. The etiologies of these cancers are not well understood, but Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a promising biomarker of risk.

"Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread availability and known effectiveness, Pap smear screening and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national targets. New modes of online communication through social media - which have transformed information sharing, especially for younger individuals - present opportunities to target health communication more effectively to improve cervical cancer prevention. Although the Internet has yet to realize its full potential for health-related communication, about 87% of US adults have used the Internet to look for health information, and a large majority of younger Americans report they would share personal health information on social media sites. Thus, pushing the current boundaries to capitalize on social media to inform decision-making about cancer screening and prevention offers great potential. The long-term goals of this research are to 1) generate validated methodologies to systematically study social media content, and 2) promote cervical cancer screening and prevention more effectively using social media. In pursuit of these goals, we will used a novel methodological approaches to characterize cervical cancer content present in social media and then to create and test messages within an experimental online social network. In Aim 1, we will identify and rank the key words related to cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination in social media messages. We will identify statistically significant phrases that are co-occurring in messages drawn from six months of publically available content from Twitter and Facebook. This technique will allow us to synthesize the entire breadth of content on screening and vaccination on social media, and to extract the full-text of messages corresponding to the most common significant words/ phrases. In Aim 2, we will categorize and validate the range of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination discussion on social media websites. We will use qualitative content analysis informed by grounded theory to analyze a random sample of the findings from Aim 1, coding a minimum of 1500 messages. This will allow us to gain an in-depth understanding of the range of real-life discussions online. This will also serve as the validation of the machine learning result from Aim 1, as well as the basis for the development of new cervical cancer prevention messages that will be tested in Aim 3. Building upon both of these aims, in Aim 3, we will create tailored cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination messages and track responses and spread in an online social network. Using the content knowledge from Aims 1 & 2, we will create tailored messages about cervical cancer screening and prevention and then pre-test them using virtual focus groups to gain insights from our target audience. We will establish a simulated online network to evaluate the spread of these messages, as each network member can directly share health opinions with others in the study. Within this setting, we will be able to determine the diffusion of specific, effective screening messages, as well as determine what types of network structures and message authors have the biggest impact.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We plan to study publicly available messages on online social media websites (for example, Twitter and Facebook) related to cervical cancer screening and prevention, such as comments about Pap smears. We will determine the major discussion topics on these websites, and then use this information to craft new messages about cervical cancer prevention. Finally, in an experiment, we will test how these messages are shared between individuals - in order to learn how public health agencies and researchers can improve their online health-related communication strategies to promote cervical cancer screening.                ",Influencing cervical cancer prevention and detection online through social media,8693710,R01CA178875,"['Adult', 'American', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Promotion', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Pap smear', 'Perception', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'experience', 'girls', 'health organization', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'social networking website', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'web site', 'web-based social networking']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,504210,685608202,0.04224477057013117
"Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer prevention processes are rapidly transforming. Changes in guidelines, and resulting changes in practice, stem from breakthroughs in basic research on cervical cancer and technological advances in testing, diagnosis, and prevention. For example discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has led to         development of HPV vaccines and recommendations for their use in the general public. As cervical cancer prevention practices change, we face widening gaps in our knowledge about the impact of these changes on women's health, that is, the balance of risk and harms affected by newly recommended screening intervals, and how this balance differs for vaccinated and unvaccinated women. We also need more information about barriers to screening uptake and adherence to guidelines screening intervals. To address these gaps, we propose supplementing our Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS) PROSPR Research Center with a Cervical Cancer Unit that will collect population-based data and work with the PROSPR network to guide studies of the cervical cancer screening process. Our study team, located at Group Health Research Institute, has access to extensive data from Group Health, a health care and coverage system in Washington State. Multilevel data are available from patients (e.g., characteristics, screening dates, cancer outcomes), providers (e.g., specialty), and facilities that include both health system owned-and-operated clinics and contracted community affiliates. Group Health members represent a diverse population of patients who receive care under a range of insurance coverage programs available in the US, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to new plans offered beginning January 1, 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Our study team is well positioned to carry out this proposed work. We are already closely linked to Group Health clinical providers, and have a breadth and depth of experience in cervical cancer screening research that includes knowledge of Group Health data systems and methods for extracting information from these systems, and up-to-date methodology including study design and analysis of complex data.         Public Health Relevance:  Cervical cancer screening recommendations have undergone dramatic changes, shifting from annual Papanicolaou (Pap) testing to 2- to 3-year rescreening intervals, and incorporating HPV DNA testing. This supplement to our PROSPR Research Center will enable our team to provide population-level data to improve our understanding of the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening as practiced.                ",Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS),8791225,U54CA163261,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Commit', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Contracts', 'Cytopathology', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Equilibrium', 'Face', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Group Practice', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Northwestern United States', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'anticancer research', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'care delivery', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized data processing', 'demographics', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'population based', 'population health', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'stem', 'uptake']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,U54,2014,649872,148927,0.0331992786025966
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Serum IgE and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract There is consistent and convincing evidence that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Very little is understood about this association; a major limitation is the absence of studies of biomarkers of allergic response and their relation to risk. Individuals with allergy have higher levels of serum IgE, both total IgE and allergen-specific IgE. Study of these biomarkers can potentially provide a better indicator of risk than self-report, as well as provide a better understanding of the biologic processes behind this association. The specific aim of this study is to measure pre-diagnostic serum IgE -- total IgE and specific IgE to respiratory allergens and food allergens -- and their associations with risk pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that higher levels of IgE are associated with reduced risk. We will use a nested case-control design within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial. IgE will be measured in 230 pancreatic cancer cases and 460 controls from this cohort, with 2 controls for each case individually matched on age at baseline, gender, race, and date of blood draw. In data analysis, we will investigate the association of each IgE measure with risk of pancreatic cancer, using conditional logistic regression to obtain odds ratios and to adjust for possible confounders. Because of the widespread systemic effects of pancreatic cancer, a prospective design is far stronger than a case-control design in which disease may affect IgE levels. Our study team consists of epidemiologists and a biostatistician who are experienced in pancreatic cancer research, the PLCO cohort, and in IgE measures, and a physician with clinical and research specialties in allergy. While allergies are not a risk factor that can be modified, study of IgE will provide more complete understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the association between allergies and risk. This can help develop a risk profile to identify individuals at increased risk; in addition, understanding of the biologic basis for the observed protective association can suggest novel immune-based therapies for this deadly disease.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Several studies have found that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we will investigate whether a biologic marker of allergies, serum IgE, is also related to risk. We will compare IgE for cases and controls in serum that was collected as part of a cohort study several years ago, before cases developed pancreatic cancer. The overall goals are to help define people at higher risk of pancreatic cancer and to better understand the biologic basis of the link between allergies and this disease.",Serum IgE and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer,8536605,U01CA150138,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Allergens', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Pathway', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'abstracting', 'allergic response', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'food allergen', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2013,30932,185946435,0.013585049900868871
"Changes in Physical and Cognitive Functioning among Cancer Survivors     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to examine the impact of a cancer diagnosis on physical and cognitive functioning among older cancer survivors based on longitudinal data from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study. Public use HRS data from ten waves (1992-2010) will be linked to restricted HRS cancer data to identify respondents newly diagnosed with cancer and to form cohorts by major types of cancer. Data on sociodemographics, co-morbidities, and health behaviors, will be used to assess differences in physical and cognitive functioning exhibited at subsequent time points among cancer survivors and compared to persons with no history of cancer, to help separate the effects of cancer from the normal effects of aging. These data will be linked to the HRS Medicare Claims and Summary Data (2007) to identify extent of disease and treatment modality(s). Multilevel modeling and logistic regression models will be used to examine change over time and the association between predictors and patterns of change. This research will test the hypothesis that the diagnosis of cancer has a significant negative effect on physical and cognitive functioning separate from the normal effects of aging. We hypothesize that the risk of adverse changes in physical and cognitive functioning after a cancer diagnosis is influenced by various treatment-related factors as well as by socioeconomic and health factors present before and/or after diagnosis. Insight gained from the proposed project will improve our understanding of the adverse physical and cognitive health outcomes following a cancer diagnosis in older adults and will inform interventions targeted at addressing both age-related and cancer-related consequences to improve the quality of life for long-term cancer survivors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Insight gained from the proposed project will improve our understanding of the adverse physical and cognitive health outcomes following a cancer diagnosis in older adults and will inform interventions targeted at addressing both age-related and cancer-related consequences to improve the quality of life for long-term cancer survivors.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas. We will use unconditional logistic regression to analyze the association between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma. Findings from this exploratory study will provide preliminary data to design a prospective study with adequate sample size to confirm the findings from this study and comprehensively evaluate the role of mitochondria in colorectal cancer etiology.          This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to further our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental/lifestyle factors that affect risk for incident, sporadic colorectal cancer.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US. The etiologies of these cancers are not well understood, but Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a promising biomarker of risk.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8460774,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2013,343648,158262644,0.051445788107195925
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of these cancers. The proposed study also could potentially identify new avenues for research on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk assessment and screening.          Endometrial and ovarian cancers are the most common gynecological cancers in the US. The etiologies of these cancers are not well understood, but Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a promising biomarker of risk. Results of the proposed study will increase our understanding of the etiologies of ovarian and endometrial cancer and could potentially identify new avenues for research on approaches to risk assessment and screening.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Serum IgE and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract There is consistent and convincing evidence that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Very little is understood about this association; a major limitation is the absence of studies of biomarkers of allergic response and their relation to risk. Individuals with allergy have higher levels of serum IgE, both total IgE and allergen-specific IgE. Study of these biomarkers can potentially provide a better indicator of risk than self-report, as well as provide a better understanding of the biologic processes behind this association. The specific aim of this study is to measure pre-diagnostic serum IgE -- total IgE and specific IgE to respiratory allergens and food allergens -- and their associations with risk pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that higher levels of IgE are associated with reduced risk. We will use a nested case-control design within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial. IgE will be measured in 230 pancreatic cancer cases and 460 controls from this cohort, with 2 controls for each case individually matched on age at baseline, gender, race, and date of blood draw. In data analysis, we will investigate the association of each IgE measure with risk of pancreatic cancer, using conditional logistic regression to obtain odds ratios and to adjust for possible confounders. Because of the widespread systemic effects of pancreatic cancer, a prospective design is far stronger than a case-control design in which disease may affect IgE levels. Our study team consists of epidemiologists and a biostatistician who are experienced in pancreatic cancer research, the PLCO cohort, and in IgE measures, and a physician with clinical and research specialties in allergy. While allergies are not a risk factor that can be modified, study of IgE will provide more complete understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the association between allergies and risk. This can help develop a risk profile to identify individuals at increased risk; in addition, understanding of the biologic basis for the observed protective association can suggest novel immune-based therapies for this deadly disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Several studies have found that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we will investigate whether a biologic marker of allergies, serum IgE, is also related to risk. We will compare IgE for cases and controls in serum that was collected as part of a cohort study several years ago, before cases developed pancreatic cancer. The overall goals are to help define people at higher risk of pancreatic cancer and to better understand the biologic basis of the link between allergies and this disease.

"Mitochondria as a novel biomarker of colorectal adenoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although early detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, the precursors of most colorectal cancers, has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer, the disease remains the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. There is increasing evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. We recently found that increased circulating concentrations of oxidative stress biomarkers are associated with increased colorectal adenoma risk. Mitochondria (Mt) are the predominant source of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a major cause of endogenous oxidative stress. Mitochondrial variations (mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) have been associated with increased ROS production. Despite the central role for mitochondria in ROS production, their role in pathogenesis of colorectal adenomas has not been evaluated. We hypothesize that mtDNA copy number and germline variations in the mitochondrial genome will be associated with colorectal adenoma risk. We propose to evaluate this hypothesis by measuring mtDNA copy number using real time polymerase chain reaction and genotyping mitochondrial tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) and D-loop polymorphisms in 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls collected from three methodologically very similar, colonoscopy-based case-control studies of incident, sporadic colorectal adenomas. We will use unconditional logistic regression to analyze the association between mtDNA copy number, mitochondrial polymorphisms and colorectal adenoma risk. This innovative epidemiologic study seeks to translate our understanding of mitochondrial biology into discovery of novel mitochondrial biomarkers that can inform strategies for the primary prevention of colorectal adenoma. Findings from this exploratory study will provide preliminary data to design a prospective study with adequate sample size to confirm the findings from this study and comprehensively evaluate the role of mitochondria in colorectal cancer etiology.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to further our understanding of the complex interactions between genetic and environmental/lifestyle factors that affect risk for incident, sporadic colorectal cancer.              This application aims to evaluate the association between mitochondrial variants (mitochondrial DNA copy number and mitochondrial polymorphisms) and risk of colorectal adenoma is an existing dataset of 392 colorectal adenoma cases and 565 controls.

"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal. The proposed plans for a K22 Award will complement the strong foundation provided by the candidate's K07 Award and afford her the additional protected time needed during her critical transition phase to become an independent investigator and a leading expert in the nutritional epidemiology of female hormonal cancers, spanning prevention and survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate the role of excess body mass and changes in weight on ovarian cancer prognosis using the unique opportunity provided by the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, which includes a large population with detailed laboratory and clinical information.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b  Background: Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, recency and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.   Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities. If VAW does influence cancer care interventions can be developed to identify VAW in women with cancer and provide appropriate support to ensure receipt of recommended care.",Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b,8247668,R01MD004598,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Appalachian Region', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Cervical', 'Child', 'Choices and Control', 'Clinic', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Consent', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Divorce', 'Education', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equation', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family member', 'Fecal occult blood', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Kentucky', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Low income', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Occult blood screen', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Palliative Care', 'Pap smear', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Status', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'Unemployment', 'Uninsured', 'United Nations', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Violence', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'care seeking', 'cohort', 'emotional abuse', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'residence', 'rural area', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'violence against women']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2012,279830,158262644,0.051445788107195925
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain.

"Prospective Study of Serum MIS and Gynecologic Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence indicate a protective effect of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Objectives/Hypothesis: We hypothesize that premenopuasal women's circulating MIS concentrations are inversely associated with their risk of subsequently developing epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancer. Specific Aims: 1) Prospectively determine the association of premenopausal circulating MIS levels with risk of subsequent epithelial ovarian cancer; and 2) with risk of endometrial cancer. Study Design: A prospective case-control study will be conducted nested in 9 established cohorts including the Columbia, MO Serum Bank, CLUE I and CLUE II in Washington County Maryland, New York University (NYU) Women's Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Guernsey, UK Cohort, Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study, European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC), Hormones and Diet in the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET), and Shanghai Women's Health Study. The 9 cohorts include women who provided a blood sample at d 45 years old while premenopausal and subsequently developed invasive ovarian cancer (n=305) or endometrial cancer (n=373). For each of these cases, two controls will be selected matched on cohort, age and date of blood collection. MIS will be measured using a commercially available and validated MIS enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis will be conducted using conditional logistic regression. Significance: The proposed study will prospectively evaluate the association of a novel biomarker, MIS, with risk of developing ovarian and endometrial cancers.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Serum IgE and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract There is consistent and convincing evidence that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. Very little is understood about this association; a major limitation is the absence of studies of biomarkers of allergic response and their relation to risk. Individuals with allergy have higher levels of serum IgE, both total IgE and allergen-specific IgE. Study of these biomarkers can potentially provide a better indicator of risk than self-report, as well as provide a better understanding of the biologic processes behind this association. The specific aim of this study is to measure pre-diagnostic serum IgE -- total IgE and specific IgE to respiratory allergens and food allergens -- and their associations with risk pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that higher levels of IgE are associated with reduced risk. We will use a nested case-control design within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial. IgE will be measured in 230 pancreatic cancer cases and 460 controls from this cohort, with 2 controls for each case individually matched on age at baseline, gender, race, and date of blood draw. In data analysis, we will investigate the association of each IgE measure with risk of pancreatic cancer, using conditional logistic regression to obtain odds ratios and to adjust for possible confounders. Because of the widespread systemic effects of pancreatic cancer, a prospective design is far stronger than a case-control design in which disease may affect IgE levels. Our study team consists of epidemiologists and a biostatistician who are experienced in pancreatic cancer research, the PLCO cohort, and in IgE measures, and a physician with clinical and research specialties in allergy. While allergies are not a risk factor that can be modified, study of IgE will provide more complete understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the association between allergies and risk. This can help develop a risk profile to identify individuals at increased risk; in addition, understanding of the biologic basis for the observed protective association can suggest novel immune-based therapies for this deadly disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Several studies have found that self-reported allergies are associated with reduced risk of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we will investigate whether a biologic marker of allergies, serum IgE, is also related to risk. We will compare IgE for cases and controls in serum that was collected as part of a cohort study several years ago, before cases developed pancreatic cancer. The overall goals are to help define people at higher risk of pancreatic cancer and to better understand the biologic basis of the link between allergies and this disease.          n/a",Serum IgE and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer,8050444,U01CA150138,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Allergens', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical Research', 'Colorectal', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Pathway', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Gender', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ovarian', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'abstracting', 'allergic response', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'food allergen', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'tumor']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2011,101404,185946435,0.013607236954514046
"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.","Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis",8110692,R03DE019178,"['Affect', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bladder', 'Cells', 'Cervix carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Epithelial', 'Esophageal', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastric Adenocarcinoma', 'Genbank', 'Genes', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Larynx', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Microbe', 'Micrococcaceae', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stomach', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'carcinogenesis', 'cytokine', 'extracellular', 'insight', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'microbial', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'novel strategies', 'oral bacteria', 'oral tissue', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NIDCR,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R03,2011,115500,77336088,0.022291731484010473
"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal. The proposed plans for a K22 Award will complement the strong foundation provided by the candidate's K07 Award and afford her the additional protected time needed during her critical transition phase to become an independent investigator and a leading expert in the nutritional epidemiology of female hormonal cancers, spanning prevention and survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate the role of excess body mass and changes in weight on ovarian cancer prognosis using the unique opportunity provided by the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, which includes a large population with detailed laboratory and clinical information.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening). Each of these groups is defined by a specific combination of characteristics. The Specific Aims of this two-year, secondary analysis R21 proposal are:  Aim 1.) To apply classification methods to the 2006 and 2008 BRFSS, and to the 2005 and 2008 NHIS, in order to identify groups in the population at risk of lower screening utilization based on multivariable classification. Screening domains will be for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer.  Aim 2.) To examine the results obtained across classification methods, in order to better understand how best to capitalize on the potential of using classification methods to identify groups in the population at-risk of low cancer screening.  Aim 3.) To use classification methods to investigate whether content from BRFSS state-optional modules can supplement information from the core BRFSS to identify groups likely to have low utilization and complex service needs.  Multivariable classification of at-risk groups, informed by CTA methods, could enhance the targeting of audiences for the important pre-intervention tasks of needs assessment, barrier/facilitator identification, and marshalling the resources needed to improve the screening status of those groups.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests. It is important to continue to develop ways of identifying these groups, so that those at risk of low use can be targeted for screening programs and services. This research will examine how ""classification analysis"" methods can improve the identification of groups in the population who have low utilization of cancer screening tests (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate).              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7940859,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2010,39783,158262644,-0.011092230148623173
"Bacterial colonization, inflammation and its role in carcinogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that over 20% of fatal cancers or about 2.1 million cases per year worldwide can be attributed to viral or bacterial infections, suggesting the tremendous potential of controlling microbe-related processes for cancer prevention. Although viral infections have been associated with cancer, the involvement of bacteria has also recently received attention, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that studies on the role of bacteria in cancer progressions are warranted. Important mechanisms by which bacterial agents may promote carcinogenesis include chronic infection, inflammation, immune evasion and immune suppression. Our overall hypothesis is that the bacterial colonization is associated with chronic inflammation which has the capacity to support oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) progression. The oral cavity and OSCC represent a unique opportunity to study the bacterial association with cancer because: (1) the microbiota of the oral cavity is well documented; and (2) the ease of sample collection. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that the bacterial colonization is altered in OSCC and dysplasia as compared to adjacent normal mucosa. We will determine the difference between the bacterial colonization (cultivable and non-cultivable) in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, vs. adjacent normal mucosa. Using 400 bp fragments of the 16S rDNA gene and high throughput 454 pyrosequencing we will determine the relative abundance and species richness of the bacterial population in these sample groups. Artificial Intelligence analysis will be used to discover a pattern of bacterial phylotypes that are represented in OSCC, epithelial dysplasia, and normal mucosa. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the colonization of dysplastic lesions and OSCC by bacterial pathogens is associated with chronic inflammation. We will use immunohistochemistry to compare the composition and quantity of the inflammatory cell infiltrate and evaluate the cytokine profile in the same tissue samples of OSCC, dysplasia, and normal mucosa used in Aim 1. The differences in bacterial profile between OSCC tissue and normal mucosa and the similarities in bacterial profile for OSCC and dysplasia will be used to develop a bacterial profile of OSCC which in association with inflammatory factors will serve as an indicator of risk for OSCC. We expect that understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will open novel approaches to direct the course of future interventions and prevention strategies by controlling the infectious agent, which are the approaches now used for managing Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer.      Public Health Relevance: Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person. The study will direct the course of future intervention and prevention strategies for this pathological condition.           Narrative Understanding the impact of oral bacteria on the development of OSCC will lead to patient oriented research where one may be able to assess OSCC risk by measuring bacterial profile in oral tissue of a person.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms.

"Classification Tree Analysis to Enhance Targeting for Cancer Screening Programs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence of disparities in the utilization of cancer screening tests plays a central role in the nation's total set of efforts for cancer prevention and control. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are two key resources. Identifying groups in the population who are at risk of lower screening utilization typically starts with univariate analyses of associations between a set of potential covariates and utilization rates of a screening test, followed by multivariable analysis, most often using logistic regression, to determine the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. These statistically significant variables are then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce the observed disparities. Those interventions have the objective of providing resources necessary for improving access to, and utilization of, screening tests.  This proposed research is intended to examine the potential for Classification Analysis to inform the process of identifying at-risk groups for screening programs and services. Classification Analysis uses progressive segmentation of a dataset (i.e., recursive partitioning), to identify groups with higher versus lower rates on a dependent variable (e.g., cancer screening). Each of these groups is defined by a specific combination of characteristics. The Specific Aims of this two-year, secondary analysis R21 proposal are:  Aim 1.) To apply classification methods to the 2006 and 2008 BRFSS, and to the 2005 and 2008 NHIS, in order to identify groups in the population at risk of lower screening utilization based on multivariable classification. Screening domains will be for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer.  Aim 2.) To examine the results obtained across classification methods, in order to better understand how best to capitalize on the potential of using classification methods to identify groups in the population at-risk of low cancer screening.  Aim 3.) To use classification methods to investigate whether content from BRFSS state-optional modules can supplement information from the core BRFSS to identify groups likely to have low utilization and complex service needs.  Multivariable classification of at-risk groups, informed by CTA methods, could enhance the targeting of audiences for the important pre-intervention tasks of needs assessment, barrier/facilitator identification, and marshalling the resources needed to improve the screening status of those groups.               PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests. It is important to continue to develop ways of identifying these groups, so that those at risk of low use can be targeted for screening programs and services. This research will examine how ""classification analysis"" methods can improve the identification of groups in the population who have low utilization of cancer screening tests (breast, colorectal, cervical, prostate).              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT National-level surveys are used to identify groups in the population who need extra resources and services in order to improve their utilization of cancer screening tests.

"Obesity in ovarian cancer prognosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Because symptoms tend be nonspecific, early detection is difficult and most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage when the prognosis is poor. Nonetheless, there is clinical evidence that even given the same tumor characteristics, some cases experience much better survival than others. However, little is known about lifestyle factors affecting ovarian cancer survival. Obesity in particular may delay diagnosis, hinder optimal surgical and cytotoxic treatment, and cause postoperative complications. Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of obesity and weight changes on several aspects of ovarian cancer clinical management, including detection, treatment, and survival, as it comprises a large population with detailed laboratory, clinical, and treatment information.        We propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study including approximately 1,900 invasive ovarian cancer cases diagnosed between 2000-2008 and follow-up information through 2010 among KPNC members. Our main objectives are to examine the role of body mass index (BMI) on ovarian cancer survival and on CA-125 levels, a tumor marker routinely used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. Multivariate Cox Proportional Regression methods will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We will also use multivariate logistic regression to evaluate the association between BMI and elevated CA-125 (defined as >35 U/ml). Our findings may provide critical information to improve our understanding of ovarian cancer prognostic factors and to reduce disparities in the quality of cancer care in obese patients, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical management of ovarian cancer to reduce ovarian cancer deaths.        This study represents the first step in the preparation of an R01 application to develop a prospective cohort study of ovarian cancer survivors among KPNC members to study genetic and lifestyle factors affecting survival. In addition to addressing significant issues, the study is designed to provide experience in cancer survivorship, as well as familiarity with KPNC files and procedures, and to generate preliminary data and publications to support the R01 proposal. The proposed plans for a K22 Award will complement the strong foundation provided by the candidate's K07 Award and afford her the additional protected time needed during her critical transition phase to become an independent investigator and a leading expert in the nutritional epidemiology of female hormonal cancers, spanning prevention and survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to evaluate the role of excess body mass and changes in weight on ovarian cancer prognosis using the unique opportunity provided by the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California system, which includes a large population with detailed laboratory and clinical information.

"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer.

"Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral research with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients is high priority. The etiology of HNSCC is linked to the health risk behaviors of tobacco and alcohol consumption. At diagnosis, prevalence rates for cigarette smoking and alcohol use have been estimated to be above 80% and 65%, respectively. Among patients who report cigarette smoking in the year preceding diagnosis, about one-third continue to smoke following completion of cancer treatment. So while HNSCC diagnosis may be considered a ""teachable moment,"" in which motivation for health behavior change is theorized to be high, not all patients regard HNSCC diagnosis as a sufficient catalyst for cigarette smoking cessation. Notably, this is despite the fact that continued cigarette smoking is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including poorer treatment response and higher risk for recurrence. Researchers have made attempts to identify variables associated with cigarette smoking after HNSCC diagnosis, but the current literature is limited. The overall objective of the proposed project is to increase understanding of factors facilitating and impeding smoking cessation among patients recently diagnosed with HNSCC. Specific aims: (1) To characterize the trajectory of cigarette smoking from the time of HNSCC diagnosis to 6 months following initiation of cancer treatment, (2) To assess the utility of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking, and (3) To assess the independent contribution of depressive symptoms and concurrent alcohol use for understanding changes in HNSCC patients' cigarette smoking. The above aims will be achieved using a prospective, longitudinal design in which 120 HNSCC patients are assessed before treatment initiation and then 2 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Males and females will be included in the study and the demographic characteristics of participants are expected to reflect the population of Kentucky. At each assessment, data will be collected via telephone interview. Study hypotheses will be tested using McNemar tests of paired comparisons, binomial logistic regression, and linear multiple regression analyses. Study results have the potential to highlight the importance of integrating discussions of behavior change into the course of cancer treatment, and may inform health personnel and behavioral science researchers of significant risk factors for cigarette smoking following HNSCC diagnosis. Results of the project may also be helpful in developing more efficacious smoking cessation interventions for HNSCC patients.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Overall, the proposed research is important because of its emphasis on understanding factors related to the reduction health risk behaviors, and associated improvement in clinical outcomes.           n/a",Cigarette Smoking among Head and Neck Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,7679187,F31CA139956,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Female', 'Future', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Kentucky', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Paired Comparison', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Planning Theory', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'behavior change', 'cancer therapy', 'catalyst', 'cigarette smoking', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'smoking cessation', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,F31,2009,38329,158262644,-0.011092230148623173
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests sufficiently reliable to apply to clinical practice in the detection of colon cancer. The focus of this work is to utilized new technology develop in our laboratory to define a non-invasive blood test applicable to early detection, diagnosis and/or screening of patients and permit preventive strategies, differential treatment and/or therapeutic targeting.",Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection,7586435,R21CA132723,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Comorbidity', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family history of', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Printing', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'new technology', 'racial and ethnic', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,211859,59298088,-0.067600928308425
"Does Violence Against Women result in disparities in cancer care for women with b    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Violence against women (VAW) is defined by the United Nations as ""any act of gender based violence that results in physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women."" In Kentucky almost 40% of women had experienced some form of VAW in their lifetime. The frequency of VAW poses a serious public health challenge not only due to the prevalence but also the long term impact on women's health, documented in an impressive body of literature. However, very little research has explored the effect of lifetime VAW on cancer prevention and control. Kentucky has a high cancer burden with the highest cancer mortality rate of all US states. Incidence rates of cancer and the proportion of women diagnosed at a later stage are higher in the Appalachian region of Kentucky. VAW frequently co-occurs with social factors leading to health disparities including unemployment, less education and minority race. Overall objectives of this project are to determine the extent to which VAW may explain noted disparities in cancer care based on women's race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to health insurance, or residence in high poverty and rural areas of Kentucky. Specific aims: To determine whether VAW is associated with disparities in breast cancer (aim 1), colorectal cancer (aim 2) and cervical cancer (aim 3) care outcomes to include not receiving cancer screening at recommended intervals, being diagnosed with cancer at a later stage, not receiving recommended cancer treatment including supportive/palliative care, and poorer cancer specific survival among women diagnosed with these cancers in Kentucky and adjusting for relevant confounders including race, socioeconomic status, having health insurance, rural residence, and specific regions of high poverty (e.g., living in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky or the Delta region of western Kentucky). Methods: We propose a prospective cohort using the Kentucky Cancer Registry (KCR) as the source of 3150 breast cancer cases, 1575 colorectal cancer cases and 525 cervical cancer cases. These 5250 women will be interviewed by phone to determine their lifetime exposure to VAW and comorbid conditions. These data will be linked with state level Medicare claims data for women completing phone surveys who are 65 or older. The Medicare claims data, administered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services include comprehensive coverage of medical services regardless of where the patients seek care in the nation, which would allow the detailed examination of the proposed cancer care continuum: cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, treatment, supportive or palliative care and survivorship. Both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling will be used to determine the role of VAW (by frequency, duration, severity, and type) and socioeconomic attributes influencing disparities in cancer care. These associations will be investigated for each of the hypothesized five cancer care outcomes and by specific cancer. The mediating or moderating role of socioeconomic factors will also be explored using structural equation modeling. Relevance: This will be the first population-based cohort of the influence of VAW on the life course of cancer care in a state with high cancer burden and regions of extreme poverty. Findings will have significant public health impact in reducing disparities and improving cancer prevention and control in women.               Determining whether violence against women influences the life course of cancer prevention and control for women with breast, cervical or colorectal cancer can result in an important opportunity to understand reasons for and potential solutions to cancer care disparities.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For many years now tamoxifen has been the endocrine treatment of choice for women with breast cancer. Despite the introduction of other SERMs and aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen is still widely used and is expected to continue being widely used in important subgroups of breast cancer patients worldwide in the next decade. Many studies have consistently shown that long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine corpus cancer. The association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics of subsequent uterine corpus cancers and ultimate survival is less clear and deserves further investigation in larger studies. In addition, knowledge on effect modification by recency of use, body mass index and hormonal replacement therapy is limited. Given the fact that the survival after uterine corpus cancer is generally good, individual studies lack statistical power to examine the effect of tamoxifen on uterine corpus cancer-specific survival. Pooling of data from previous studies will allow examination of cause- specific survival of patients with a uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen with sufficient statistical power and is therefore of great importance. In addition, a combined dataset provides the opportunity to study the effect of tamoxifen in combination with other risk factors. This project involves pooled analyses of data from studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer. The specific aims of these analyses are: 1. To examine the association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics and survival of subsequent uterine corpus cancer; 2. To examine the precise nature of the duration-response curve for longer durations of tamoxifen use and effect modification by recency of use, weight and hormonal replacement therapy. From the studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer performed in recent years we selected the three largest published (100 cases or more) population-based case-control studies in which follow-up data (after uterine corpus cancer diagnosis, including cause of death), data on stage and histology of uterine corpus cancer as well as data on duration and recency of tamoxifen use, weight and use of hormonal replacement therapy were collected. Data from all patients with uterine corpus cancer after breast cancer in the three studies will be combined in one dataset, which will include about 1900 patients. Data from cases with matched controls in the three studies will be combined in a separate dataset, which will include about 1400 cases and 2600 controls. Data on grade and stage of the uterine corpus cancer were collected for part of the cases. For cases with missing data additional data will be collected and for part of the cases additional follow-up data (including cause of death) will also be collected. Cox regression and conditional logistic regression will be used for the analyses of the final combined datasets.              n/a",Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast,7500035,R03CA130108,"['Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Body mass index', 'Body of uterus', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease regression', 'Endocrine', 'Endometrioid Carcinoma', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Uterine Corpus Carcinosarcoma', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'response']",NCI,NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2008,54734,0,-0.04426567191328025
"Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  About 10% of women who are unable to get pregnant are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). DOR describes a reduction in ovarian function. Few women (<5%) with this diagnosis will become pregnant spontaneously and they do not respond normally to fertility drugs. There are no effective treatments to reverse this condition. Women with DOR may have a premutation alteration of the Fragile X gene (""carriers""). Carriers of this premutation are also at increased risk for premature ovarian failure (POF), which is a greater degree of ovarian dysfunction than DOR. About 5-6% of the women with POF are premutation carriers (14% if she has a family history of premature menopause; 2% otherwise). It is unknown what percentage of women with DOR are premutation carriers. We will extend the current Fragile X research on POF to the DOR population. Specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the prevalence of the Fragile X premutation among DOR women; (2) to determine if the prevalence varies with a family history of early menopause and/or infertility; and (3) to determine if there is a relationship between patient age, follicle stimulating hormone level, and the ""size"" of the premutation. In this prospective cohort, 65 eligible DOR patients will be enrolled from three academic medical centers (Virginia, North Carolina) and one private practice. The protocol includes pretest genetic counseling, a blood sample for Fragile X testing, and questionnaires. No blood test results will be filed in the medical charts, and women will have the option of learning their Fragile X test results or not. Post test genetic counseling will be provided to all carriers. We are currently pilot-testing this study; among our first 16 participants, one is a carrier and 15 have wanted to learn their test results. The statistical analysis will consist of proportions with binomial testing, logistic regression models, and linear regression models. This research may identify a new phenotype from Fragile X premutations, begin the development of a clinical tool to predict age-at-infertility among carriers, and enhance reproductive planning and decision-making by carriers. The implications of fertility treatment to Fragile X carriers is notable in terms of transmitting Fragile X Syndrome to the children born via fertility treatment; therefore, this research also has applications to the greater issue of the impact on society and individuals from unanticipated genetic testing.          n/a",Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve,7393354,R03HD052768,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Condition', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'FMR1 Gene', 'Failure', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Female infertility', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Agents', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Premutation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Menopause', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovary', 'Participant', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premature Menopause', 'Premature Ovarian Failure', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Degree Relative', 'Societies', 'Son', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virginia', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'improved', 'prospective', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'reproductive', 'size', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R03,2008,78645,169622494,0.023533615721660447
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,7428847,R01NR008434,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adverse Drug Experience Report', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Progress Review Group', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mails', 'Mammography', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer program', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2008,93015,232986943,0.0190069588345053
"Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite their potential to reduce cancer burden through early detection, the effectiveness of screening programs is often undermined by systems-based factors and human factors. The broad aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a computer-based technology called TRACS to monitor the process of cancer screening in individual patients and intervene as necessary to ensure that the screening is conducted reliably and effectively. Interventions in TRACS consist of reliable notifications to clinicians and/or patients. However, unlike many other reminder systems, TRACS continues to monitor the care of the patient subsequent to the notification.       In this phase of the application, TRACS will be used to address the reliability of follow up of abnormal or equivocal results from screening mammography for breast cancer. A knowledge module will be created in TRACS knowledge base for the monitoring of the follow up of abnormal screening mammograms. A knowledge module comprises the process definition that specifies the appropriate course of actions for a clinical scenario and logical rules for making decisions within the process. In the next phase, additional knowledge modules will be included for comprehensive support for screening of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colon cancer.       An important feature of TRACS will be the ability to extract information from clinical text documents using a natural language processing engine called HITex. Reports of several cancer screening tests, such as mammography, cervical smear, and colonoscopy, are in the form of text documents. Thus it is important to be able to extract relevant information from these documents for use by TRACS. HITex will be customized to extract the recommendations of the radiologist from screening mammogram reports. Specifically, it will extract whether the radiologist recommends a non-routine follow up. If that is the case, HITex will extract the recommended follow up (e.g., diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or needle biopsy).       TRACS will be deployed and evaluated at the New England Medical Center (NEMC), a large urban medical center in Boston. The first step in the evaluation will be to confirm that information from screening mammogram reports from NEMC can be extracted accurately by HITex. During this phase, the TRACS software and the abnormal mammography follow up knowledge module will be tested in a simulated setting at NEMC. The tests will be conducted using records of patients who had previously undergone screening mammography at NEMC. The behavior of TRACS for these cases will be rated by a panel of experts from NEMC. In the next phase, TRACS will be deployed operationally at NEMC. Project Narrative The software proposed to being developed under this project aims to improve the early identification of a number of commonly occurring cancers. It will do so by following up reliably on the management of those patients that have abnormal results in cancer screening tests.          n/a",Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System,7481710,R43CA134042,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Boston', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Closure', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mammography', 'Medical center', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Puncture biopsy', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Schedule', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Simulate', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer generated', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCI,U.S. CARELINK,R43,2008,122518,0,-0.013504500671600212
"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7404442,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,191838,127562714,-0.016675700884269777
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, about 390,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide. Mortality from oral cancer is high in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 207,000 deaths per year usually after devastating disfiguration and loss of vital functions such as swallowing and breathing. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly due to often advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, prevention, identification of high-risk populations and early diagnosis are the most important ways to control oral cancer. The oral mucosa is exposed to numerous factors. However, existing preventive strategies against oral cancer have been focused on tobacco and alcohol use only. Chronic infections have been shown to influence carcinogenesis. Periodontitis, a chronic oral infection, may play a key role in the etiology of oral cancer. Periodontitis is caused by inflammatory reactions to microorganisms in the dental plaque leading to destruction of tissues around the teeth including alveolar bone. A causal relationship between periodontitis and oral cancer is biologically plausible. Surprisingly, studies assessing this relationship are lacking. Our long-term objective is to determine the role of periodontitis on the incidence of oral cancer. The specific aim of the proposed study is to test whether alveolar bone loss (ABL), a radiographic outcome measure of periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. We will utilize existing patient records at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients admitted between June 15, 1999 and January 10, 2005 will be eligible excluding children, edentulous and those with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A case-control study design will be used to compare oral cancer cases to controls with no cancer by the severity of ABL. We will use multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate independent effect of ABL on the incidence of oral cancer adjusting simultaneously for other risk factors of oral cancer such as tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of this study is substantial. New information will be gained providing insight into the etiology of oral cancer in a cost-effective way, using existing data. If an association between periodontitis and oral cancer exists, subjects with periodontitis could be screened for oral cancer as a ""high-risk population"" and survival from oral cancer could be improved by early diagnosis.

"Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For many years now tamoxifen has been the endocrine treatment of choice for women with breast cancer. Despite the introduction of other SERMs and aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen is still widely used and is expected to continue being widely used in important subgroups of breast cancer patients worldwide in the next decade. Many studies have consistently shown that long-term use of tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk of uterine corpus cancer. The association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics of subsequent uterine corpus cancers and ultimate survival is less clear and deserves further investigation in larger studies. In addition, knowledge on effect modification by recency of use, body mass index and hormonal replacement therapy is limited. Given the fact that the survival after uterine corpus cancer is generally good, individual studies lack statistical power to examine the effect of tamoxifen on uterine corpus cancer-specific survival. Pooling of data from previous studies will allow examination of cause- specific survival of patients with a uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen with sufficient statistical power and is therefore of great importance. In addition, a combined dataset provides the opportunity to study the effect of tamoxifen in combination with other risk factors. This project involves pooled analyses of data from studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer. The specific aims of these analyses are: 1. To examine the association between duration of tamoxifen use and specific clinicopathological characteristics and survival of subsequent uterine corpus cancer; 2. To examine the precise nature of the duration-response curve for longer durations of tamoxifen use and effect modification by recency of use, weight and hormonal replacement therapy. From the studies on tamoxifen and uterine corpus cancer performed in recent years we selected the three largest published (100 cases or more) population-based case-control studies in which follow-up data (after uterine corpus cancer diagnosis, including cause of death), data on stage and histology of uterine corpus cancer as well as data on duration and recency of tamoxifen use, weight and use of hormonal replacement therapy were collected. Data from all patients with uterine corpus cancer after breast cancer in the three studies will be combined in one dataset, which will include about 1900 patients. Data from cases with matched controls in the three studies will be combined in a separate dataset, which will include about 1400 cases and 2600 controls. Data on grade and stage of the uterine corpus cancer were collected for part of the cases. For cases with missing data additional data will be collected and for part of the cases additional follow-up data (including cause of death) will also be collected. Cox regression and conditional logistic regression will be used for the analyses of the final combined datasets.              n/a",Risk and prognosis of uterine corpus cancer after tamoxifen treatment for breast,7321399,R03CA130108,"['Aromatase Inhibitors', 'Body mass index', 'Body of uterus', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease regression', 'Endocrine', 'Endometrioid Carcinoma', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Uterine Corpus Carcinosarcoma', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'response']",NCI,NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE,R03,2007,54734,0,-0.04426567191328025
"Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, about 390,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide. Mortality from oral cancer is high in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 207,000 deaths per year usually after devastating disfiguration and loss of vital functions such as swallowing and breathing. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly due to often advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, prevention, identification of high-risk populations and early diagnosis are the most important ways to control oral cancer. The oral mucosa is exposed to numerous factors. However, existing preventive strategies against oral cancer have been focused on tobacco and alcohol use only. Chronic infections have been shown to influence carcinogenesis. Periodontitis, a chronic oral infection, may play a key role in the etiology of oral cancer. Periodontitis is caused by inflammatory reactions to microorganisms in the dental plaque leading to destruction of tissues around the teeth including alveolar bone. A causal relationship between periodontitis and oral cancer is biologically plausible. Surprisingly, studies assessing this relationship are lacking. Our long-term objective is to determine the role of periodontitis on the incidence of oral cancer. The specific aim of the proposed study is to test whether alveolar bone loss (ABL), a radiographic outcome measure of periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. We will utilize existing patient records at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients admitted between June 15, 1999 and January 10, 2005 will be eligible excluding children, edentulous and those with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A case-control study design will be used to compare oral cancer cases to controls with no cancer by the severity of ABL. We will use multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate independent effect of ABL on the incidence of oral cancer adjusting simultaneously for other risk factors of oral cancer such as tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of this study is substantial. New information will be gained providing insight into the etiology of oral cancer in a cost-effective way, using existing data.

"Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  About 10% of women who are unable to get pregnant are diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). DOR describes a reduction in ovarian function. Few women (<5%) with this diagnosis will become pregnant spontaneously and they do not respond normally to fertility drugs. There are no effective treatments to reverse this condition. Women with DOR may have a premutation alteration of the Fragile X gene (""carriers""). Carriers of this premutation are also at increased risk for premature ovarian failure (POF), which is a greater degree of ovarian dysfunction than DOR. About 5-6% of the women with POF are premutation carriers (14% if she has a family history of premature menopause; 2% otherwise). It is unknown what percentage of women with DOR are premutation carriers. We will extend the current Fragile X research on POF to the DOR population. Specific aims of this study are: (1) to determine the prevalence of the Fragile X premutation among DOR women; (2) to determine if the prevalence varies with a family history of early menopause and/or infertility; and (3) to determine if there is a relationship between patient age, follicle stimulating hormone level, and the ""size"" of the premutation. In this prospective cohort, 65 eligible DOR patients will be enrolled from three academic medical centers (Virginia, North Carolina) and one private practice. The protocol includes pretest genetic counseling, a blood sample for Fragile X testing, and questionnaires. No blood test results will be filed in the medical charts, and women will have the option of learning their Fragile X test results or not. Post test genetic counseling will be provided to all carriers. We are currently pilot-testing this study; among our first 16 participants, one is a carrier and 15 have wanted to learn their test results. The statistical analysis will consist of proportions with binomial testing, logistic regression models, and linear regression models. This research may identify a new phenotype from Fragile X premutations, begin the development of a clinical tool to predict age-at-infertility among carriers, and enhance reproductive planning and decision-making by carriers. The implications of fertility treatment to Fragile X carriers is notable in terms of transmitting Fragile X Syndrome to the children born via fertility treatment; therefore, this research also has applications to the greater issue of the impact on society and individuals from unanticipated genetic testing.          n/a",Fragile X Premutations Among Women Diagnosed with Diminished Ovarian Reserve,7195967,R03HD052768,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Condition', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'FMR1 Gene', 'Failure', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Female infertility', 'Fertility', 'Fertility Agents', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Fragile X Gene', 'Fragile X Premutation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Hormonal', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Menopause', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal Screening', 'North Carolina', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Ovarian hormone', 'Ovary', 'Participant', 'Patient currently pregnant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premature Menopause', 'Premature Ovarian Failure', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Purpose', 'Questionnaires', 'Rate', 'Reaction', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Degree Relative', 'Societies', 'Son', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virginia', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'X Chromosome', 'cohort', 'day', 'experience', 'improved', 'prospective', 'racial/ethnic difference', 'reproductive', 'size', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R03,2007,83008,169622494,0.023533615721660447
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,7263963,R01NR008434,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adverse Drug Experience Report', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Progress Review Group', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Education', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronics', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Information Technology', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Link', 'Localized', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mails', 'Mammography', 'Managed Care', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Telephone', 'Telephone Interviews', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'computer program', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'follow-up', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'mortality', 'programs', 'response']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2007,94818,232986943,0.0190069588345053
"Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence for disparities in the utilization of screening tests plays a central role in the nation's efforts at cancer prevention and control. Persons in traditionally underserved racial and ethnic groups have had lower screening rates relative to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition, they often have disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality. The process of making decisions about groups in the population who are ""at-risk"" of lower screening test utilization typically starts with bivariate analyses of the associations between a set of potential covariates and use of a screening test. The next step is to conduct multivariable analysis most often using logistic regression, to identify the final set of variables that achieve statistical significance. This final set of statistically significant variables is then translated into population groups who need targeted interventions to reduce disparities. This proposed research addresses a situation we, and others, have observed in several analyses of cancer screening in population-based data sets. That is, analyses done with different survey databases have found several instances where bivariate associations between race/ethnicity and cancer screening have been ""reversed"" in multivariable analyses. That is, a group with lower screening in bivariate (""crude rate"") analysis shows higher screening based on the ""adjusted"" results from the multivariable analysis. These reversals may have implications not only for intervention planning, but also for the way that analyses are conducted to identify correlates of a screening procedure. The Specific Aims of this proposed research are: 1.) To investigate the extent of reversals of associations from bivariate to multivariable analyses of the correlates of cancer screening, by examining results several population-level surveys, by using multiple years of each survey, and by expanding the scope of screening tests to include both women and men. 2.) To investigate variables that may explain reversals of association when comparing the results of bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with cancer screening tests. This two-year project will conduct secondary analyses with multiple years of data from three national- level surveys: The National Health Interview Survey, The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and the Health Information National Trends Survey. Five screening tests will be examined: mammography, clinical breast exam, Pap testing, prostate exam, and colorectal examination. This research will extend research to date in several ways. First, it greatly expands the number of survey databases being examined. Second, it expands the number of screening tests being reviewed, and gives added attention to male screening. Third, it uses definitions of screening that are as consistent as possible across the individual surveys. Fourth, it uses a consistent set of independent variables across the surveys. Fifth, it will be possible to look for trends over time in the presence of reversals of association for repeat screening.           n/a",Understanding Reversed Race/Ethnic Associations with Cancer Screening Tests,7238472,R21CA127828,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Breast', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diffusion', 'Disease regression', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Factor Analysis', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Health Information National Trends Survey', 'Individual', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Purpose', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistically Significant', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'racial and ethnic', 'trend']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,168472,127562714,-0.016675700884269777
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models. Statistical power calculations produced for the specific aims show that our study is adequately sized.         n/a",Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma,7227781,R01CA111720,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Biological Assay', 'Build-it', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cervical Adenocarcinoma', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cohort Studies', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Human papillomavirus 16', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Invasive', 'Investigation', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Oncogenic', 'Pap smear', 'Papillomavirus', 'Participant', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Population', 'Population Registers', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Specimen', 'Squamous Cell', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'leukocyte antigen typing', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'size', 'viral DNA']",NCI,KAROLINSKA INSTITUTE,R01,2007,395107,1346985,0.038114678677024075
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Survival is strongly determined by stage at the time of diagnosis but only approximately 40% of all new cases are diagnosed at local stage. Effective screening methods are available which can lead to early detection and reduced mortality from this disease, but these remain underutilized. We believe the factors that influence colorectal cancer screening rates in a population determine the stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in that population. We propose to conduct a population based case: control study to identify factors associated with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high-risk, underserved population. In particular, we will study the relationship between physician characteristics, type of practice, specialty training, knowledge of screening guidelines, attitudes regarding screening, actual screening practices, approaches to patient education and communication, and perceived barriers to screening in relation to stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis. The study will compare approximately 533 patients with incident local stage invasive colorectal cancer (cases) and 1242 patients with more advanced stage disease (controls) identified from a population-based cancer registry. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between cancer stage and physician characteristics and behaviors while controlling for confounding. This research will increase the knowledge base regarding screening practices of community-based physicians and how these practices affect stage at diagnosis and ultimately colorectal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the utilization of currently available screening procedures and attitudes toward screening will help illuminate the reasons for the low prevalence of colorectal screening and high colorectal mortality observed in the United States.

"Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, about 390,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed worldwide. Mortality from oral cancer is high in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 207,000 deaths per year usually after devastating disfiguration and loss of vital functions such as swallowing and breathing. Despite advances in therapy, the 5-year survival rate has not improved significantly due to often advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, prevention, identification of high-risk populations and early diagnosis are the most important ways to control oral cancer. The oral mucosa is exposed to numerous factors. However, existing preventive strategies against oral cancer have been focused on tobacco and alcohol use only. Chronic infections have been shown to influence carcinogenesis. Periodontitis, a chronic oral infection, may play a key role in the etiology of oral cancer. Periodontitis is caused by inflammatory reactions to microorganisms in the dental plaque leading to destruction of tissues around the teeth including alveolar bone. A causal relationship between periodontitis and oral cancer is biologically plausible. Surprisingly, studies assessing this relationship are lacking. Our long-term objective is to determine the role of periodontitis on the incidence of oral cancer. The specific aim of the proposed study is to test whether alveolar bone loss (ABL), a radiographic outcome measure of periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of oral cancer. We will utilize existing patient records at the Department of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Patients admitted between June 15, 1999 and January 10, 2005 will be eligible excluding children, edentulous and those with prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A case-control study design will be used to compare oral cancer cases to controls with no cancer by the severity of ABL. We will use multiple logistic regression analysis to estimate independent effect of ABL on the incidence of oral cancer adjusting simultaneously for other risk factors of oral cancer such as tobacco, alcohol, age, gender and race/ethnicity. The significance of this study is substantial. New information will be gained providing insight into the etiology of oral cancer in a cost-effective way, using existing data. If an association between periodontitis and oral cancer exists, subjects with periodontitis could be screened for oral cancer as a ""high-risk population"" and survival from oral cancer could be improved by early diagnosis. Prevention of oral cancer could begin with prevention and early treatment of periodontitis.           n/a",Periodontal Disease and the Incidence of Oral Cancer,7152031,R03CA119262,"['clinical research', 'mouth neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer', 'periodontitis']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R03,2006,87280,38765145,0.06051997020995316
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,7071179,R01NR008434,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'cost effectiveness', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'nursing research', 'patient oriented research', 'telemedicine', 'therapy compliance']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2006,97650,232986943,0.0190069588345053
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in the VA Populatio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background:Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of Cancer death in the United States. In spite of demonstrated efficacy and guideline recommendations, colorectal cancer screening rates are low.  Purpose: This study is the next step in development and validation of new instrument, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior Questionnaire (CRCSBQ) to measure colorectal cancer screening participation. The long- term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a resource of cancer screening measures with known validity across multiple settings and populations.  Methods: Phase 1: The CRCSBQ will undergo cognitive testing in a sample of patients (32 total) at two geographically diverse Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Patients will be from the primary care clinics, over age 50 and include Caucasians and African-Americans of both genders. Phase 2: The CRCSBQ and a demographics questionnaire will be administered to 200 (total) primary care patients at the 2 sites. In addition, medical record data will abstracted from the VA electronic medical record, non-VA medical records and Medicare claims data (patients older than 65). The questionnaire responses will be compared to the medical record data. We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the concordance, relative sensitivity, specificity and report-to-records ratio of the CRCSBQ to detect current colorectal cancer screening status by the American Cancer Society guidelines compared to the medical record review. We will use logistic regression analysis to explore patient factors that may be associated with agreement between self-report and medical records for colorectal cancer screening.  Importance: Accurate measurement of colorectal cancer screening behavior is the essential first step in studying the problem of low screening rates. Veterans followed at VA primary care clinics represent the ideal population in which to validate the new instrument. The VA health care system is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. There is a comprehensive electronic record which includes all inpatient and outpatient care at any VA medical center. The VA population is diverse and includes representation from a range of age groups, racial and ethnic minorities and a substantial proportion of individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and lower educational levels. n/a",Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in the VA Populatio,7007710,R21CA102379,"['behavior prediction', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'psychometrics', 'questionnaires', 'veterans']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,126389,607172798,-0.00040448920756717553
"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,7061307,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2006,322534,0,-0.030843865240930114

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,7030281,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2006,404298,533302350,0.06631587584909678
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.      Using validated and sensitive PCR-assays, the presence of HPV DNA will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on an average four smears per individual, giving totally about 4,088 smears).HPV persistence, HPV16/18/45 viral load and HLA (types DQ6 and DR15) will be analyzed for all included women. Relative risks of cervical adenocarcinoma for oncogenic HPV infections, HPV persistence,HPV16/18/45 high viral load, HLA haplotype and interactions between these factors will be estimated with conditional logistic regression. The likelihood ratio test will be used to discriminate between nested models.

"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.

"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened. This is the first study to explore very elderly women's approach to decisions about screening mammography. n/a",Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly,7107006,F32CA110424,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'decision making', 'female', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'interview', 'mammography', 'perception', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'preference', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2005,1913,135941803,0.016439850478119862
"Physician Characteristics and Colorectal Cancer Stage    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Survival is strongly determined by stage at the time of diagnosis but only approximately 40% of all new cases are diagnosed at local stage. Effective screening methods are available which can lead to early detection and reduced mortality from this disease, but these remain underutilized. We believe the factors that influence colorectal cancer screening rates in a population determine the stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in that population. We propose to conduct a population based case: control study to identify factors associated with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high-risk, underserved population. In particular, we will study the relationship between physician characteristics, type of practice, specialty training, knowledge of screening guidelines, attitudes regarding screening, actual screening practices, approaches to patient education and communication, and perceived barriers to screening in relation to stage at colorectal cancer diagnosis. The study will compare approximately 533 patients with incident local stage invasive colorectal cancer (cases) and 1242 patients with more advanced stage disease (controls) identified from a population-based cancer registry. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between cancer stage and physician characteristics and behaviors while controlling for confounding. This research will increase the knowledge base regarding screening practices of community-based physicians and how these practices affect stage at diagnosis and ultimately colorectal cancer outcome. A better understanding of the utilization of currently available screening procedures and attitudes toward screening will help illuminate the reasons for the low prevalence of colorectal screening and high colorectal mortality observed in the United States. Public Health Relevance: Underutilization of colorectal cancer screening contributes to delays in detection causing patients to be diagnosed with larger (more advanced stage) tumors.

"Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Assessing whether items are biased against minority groups is very important for the validity of measurement scales in cancer control and in health sciences in general. Although we have scales to measure beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) that are predictive of cancer screening behavior, we do not know the extent of cultural bias. Thus, we are missing a critical component in the assessment of psychometric validity. The statistical techniques for detecting item bias are called procedures for detecting differential item functioning (DIF). Under certain conditions, two of the most commonly-used DIF procedures, logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel, can inaccurately display inflated Type I error. The primary purpose of the present methodological proposal is to improve power and Type I error of both the logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedures by using alternative matching scores other than traditional summed-item score. Using existing data from two large NIH-funded randomized intervention trials to increase mammography screening (ideal because of equal percentages of Caucasians and African-Americans), we will address these aims: (1) Using computer simulations based on the data structure for generalizing results to breast cancer screening belief scales, we will evaluate the extent to which innovative modifications of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures control Type I error inflation and improve power, and (2) Using the best modified logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures (derived from Aim 1), assess items for DIF in the two existing data sets based upon ethnicity, age, education and income in six scales commonly used to predict cancer screening (barriers, benefits, susceptibility, fatalism, self-efficacy, and fear). Improved accuracy of DIF procedures will increase the validity of cancer control scales, providing a firm measurement foundation for advancing the science of cancer control and prevention. Additionally, the findings will have broad applicability to detecting item bias in other scales. n/a",Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales,6953171,R03CA113099,"['analytical method', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'bias', 'cancer prevention', 'computer simulation', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'human data', 'mammography', 'mass screening', 'method development', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2005,59961,232986943,0.013423772358214436
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,6943947,R01NR008434,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'cost effectiveness', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'nursing research', 'patient oriented research', 'telemedicine', 'therapy compliance']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2005,100000,232986943,0.0190069588345053
"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6917000,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2005,131400,0,0.010235824971267708
"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.  It will provide insight into colon cancer etiology and therefore avenues to disease prevention.  n/a",Growth Factors and Colon Cancer,6952693,R01CA085846,"['apolipoprotein E', 'aspirin', 'calcium', 'cancer prevention', 'carcinogenesis', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell proliferation', 'colon neoplasms', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic susceptibility', 'growth factor', 'informatics', 'information systems', 'insulin', 'insulin receptor', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'nutrition aspect of cancer', 'nutrition related tag', 'peroxisome proliferator activated receptor', 'somatotropin', 'vitamin D', 'vitamin D receptors']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2005,155712,228951281,0.016543551567417623
"Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in VA Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background:Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of Cancer death in the United States. In spite of demonstrated efficacy and guideline recommendations, colorectal cancer screening rates are low.  Purpose: This study is the next step in development and validation of new instrument, the Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior Questionnaire (CRCSBQ) to measure colorectal cancer screening participation. The long- term goal of this study is to contribute to the development of a resource of cancer screening measures with known validity across multiple settings and populations.  Methods: Phase 1: The CRCSBQ will undergo cognitive testing in a sample of patients (32 total) at two geographically diverse Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities. Patients will be from the primary care clinics, over age 50 and include Caucasians and African-Americans of both genders. Phase 2: The CRCSBQ and a demographics questionnaire will be administered to 200 (total) primary care patients at the 2 sites. In addition, medical record data will abstracted from the VA electronic medical record, non-VA medical records and Medicare claims data (patients older than 65). The questionnaire responses will be compared to the medical record data. We will calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the concordance, relative sensitivity, specificity and report-to-records ratio of the CRCSBQ to detect current colorectal cancer screening status by the American Cancer Society guidelines compared to the medical record review. We will use logistic regression analysis to explore patient factors that may be associated with agreement between self-report and medical records for colorectal cancer screening.  Importance: Accurate measurement of colorectal cancer screening behavior is the essential first step in studying the problem of low screening rates. Veterans followed at VA primary care clinics represent the ideal population in which to validate the new instrument. The VA health care system is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. There is a comprehensive electronic record which includes all inpatient and outpatient care at any VA medical center. The VA population is diverse and includes representation from a range of age groups, racial and ethnic minorities and a substantial proportion of individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and lower educational levels. n/a",Colorectal Cancer Screening Behavior in VA Population,6863573,R21CA102379,"['behavior prediction', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'health behavior', 'health care service utilization', 'health services research tag', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'mass screening', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'psychometrics', 'questionnaires', 'veterans']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,165120,607172798,-0.00039867321417429505
"Understand Disparities in Cervical Cancer Survival DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cervical cancer is an entirely preventable disease yet in Texas approximately 1200 women are newly diagnosed and 300 die with this disease per year. Several recent studies suggest that poverty not minority ethnicity may be an important predictor of poor survival particularly for those diagnosed at an early stage. The purpose of this project is to explore disparities in cervical cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment and survival in Texas, a large state with great ethnic, income, and rural / urban diversity. We propose a population-based cohort study of all women diagnosed with cervical cancer and reported to the Texas Cancer Registry (TCR) between 1995-2002 (N>8800 women). Specific Aims are (1) To determine whether women of minority race or ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, and African-American relative to White), those with lower income or education, and those living in more rural regions among women diagnosed with CxCa are more likely to die or have shorter survival, stratified by tumor stage. (2) To determine to what extent the differences in survival experienced by women of diverse ethnicity, income, or rurality can be explained by their treatment received, tumor stage at diagnosis or comorbid conditions. We plan to use (a) geocoded data to allow a more precise census tract level measures of socio-economic status and (b) multiple sources of cancer treatment data (Texas Medicaid, Medicare, and Hospital Discharge merged with TCR cancer and mortality data). A conceptual model is proposed to assess the role of disparities in (1) cervical cancer surivival, (2) intermediate outcomes (late stage at diagnosis and suboptimal treatment), and (3) comorbid conditions. Multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling are planned to estimate the risk of mortality and survival time, respectively. This R21 will provide pre-intervention data to identify those disparities indicators which should be the target of aggressive individual and health care provider level interventions to identify cervical cancer early and get women needed effective treatment in a timely manner. n/a",Understand Disparities in Cervical Cancer Survival,6906836,R21CA114330,"['academic achievement', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'cancer registry /resource', 'cervix neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'income', 'long term survivor', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'racial /ethnic difference', 'rural area', 'statistics /biometry', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2005,191834,135644722,0.0406428002974991
"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears). HLA and C trachomatis will be analyzed in the first smear from all included women.

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,6883181,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,400229,533302350,0.06631587584909678
"Molecular epidemiology of cervical adenocarcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this project is to improve the biologic understanding of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous cancer of the cervix uteri (in the following referred to as adenocarcinoma) through investigation of its viral etiology, and genes encoding certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes. The long-term objective is to propose rational prevention strategies for this disease. Our main specific aims are to: 1) estimate the relative risks for adenocarcinoma both as a function of HPV presence overall and as a function of time since first detected infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); 2) to assess whether persistence and/or a high initial HPV 16/18/45 viral load is a determinant of adenocarcinoma; 3) to assess whether certain HLA haplotypes are associated with risk for adenocarcinoma, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HPV 16/18/45. This project will build on experience from two previous studies examining squamous cell cervical cancer and HPV (both funded by NIH). Our capacity to conduct these studies is derived from the utilization of unique prerequisites in Sweden, namely the extensive documentation present in computerized registers for population-based PAP-smear screening, potential ascertainment of all incident cases of adenocarcinoma, and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested case-control design in this large study base, with up to 32 years of complete follow-up, 511 women with adenocarcinoma and 511 individually matched control women will be identified.

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant. We will also generate logistic regression models to test the independent effects of the intervention and to identify predictors for colorectal cancer screening. n/a",Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial,6887830,R01CA100856,"['Asian Americans', 'Internet', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'continuing education', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'health disparity', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'information dissemination', 'longitudinal human study', 'mass screening', 'medical education', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'patient oriented research', 'radio', 'television', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCI,CANCER PREVENTION INSTIT OF CALIFORNIA,R01,2005,437729,0,-0.030843865240930114
"Epidemiology of Stress and GDM among Latina Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. with rates consistently higher in Latinas than non-Latina whites. Shifting the prevention period for these conditions upstream, to pregnancy, may be an innovative strategy. The major aims of this proposal are to evaluate new and timely hypotheses regarding modifiable determinants of GDM among Latina women. We propose to evaluate the association between external stressors (physical activity), internal stressors (psychosocial stress), and mediators between these variables and risk of GDM.   Using a prospective cohort design, 2,300 Latina (predominantly Puerto Rican) prenatal care patients will be recruited from Baystate Medical Center at their first prenatal care visit (8-12 weeks gestation). Bilingual interviewers will obtain detailed information on physical activity patterns via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ) (NIH/NICHD R03-39341) developed and validated for use in this population. Psychosocial stress will be assessed through 1) self-report (life events, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem) using scales validated in Latina populations, and 2) salivary cortisol, a physiologic marker of response to stress. Information on pregravid BMI, diet, cigarette smoking, substance abuse, medical and obstetric history, acculturation, and sociodemographic factors will also be queried. Weight and waist circumference will be measured. Two subsequent interviews, conducted at the time of routine ultrasound (18-20 weeks gestation) and GDM screen (24-28 weeks gestation), will update information on the variables of interest and repeat the salivary cortisol collection. A gestational-age stratified sample of 100 women from the cohort will be selected to assess diurnal variation in the cortisol measure. Lab reports will be abstracted for GDM screen results and a 4th interview will be conducted at 32-34 weeks gestation among those with elevated screening glucose. After delivery, medical records will be abstracted to confirm incident GDM and birth outcomes. Logistic regression will be used to assess the relationship between physical activity, psychosocial stress and GDM risk. Marginal structural models will assess the role of diet, body fat distribution, weight gain, and smoking as mediating variables in the relationship between stress and GDM. Cortisol will be analyzed in a nested case-control fashion on 116 GDM cases and a matched 4:1 sample of controls. A secondary analysis will prospectively assess the relationship between stress and adverse birth outcomes in among women with elevated screening glucose.  The proposed study builds upon our experience in the Latina GDM Study (American Diabetes Association Career Award) and extends the work of prior investigations through prospective assessment at multiple points in gestation, a multidimensional approach to stress measurement, and detailed evaluation of potential confounding and mediating factors in a large, high-risk population.

"Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The benefits of mammography screening in women age 80 and older are uncertain. Guidelines encourage physicians to consider life expectancy before screening elderly women and to discuss the risks and benefits of screening with their elderly patients. Despite these recommendations, many elderly women are screened even those in poor health. It is unknown why so many elderly women are choosing to be screened and what factors influence this decision. To determine the accuracy of elderly women's knowledge about screening mammography and factors that influence screening decisions, the applicant proposes a two-phase study. Phase 1 uses qualitative methods to develop a survey about mammography screening decisions in the elderly and phase 2 involves administering the survey to a larger sample of women age 80 and older, using women ages 50-69 as a comparison group. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression will be performed to compare the accuracy of screening knowledge between elderly and younger patients as well as to determine age differences in the influence of several factors on the decision to be screened. This is the first study to explore very elderly women's approach to decisions about screening mammography. n/a",Mammography Screening Decisions in the Elderly,6834886,F32CA110424,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'clinical research', 'data collection', 'decision making', 'female', 'health surveys', 'human middle age (35-64)', 'human old age (65+)', 'human subject', 'interview', 'mammography', 'perception', 'postdoctoral investigator', 'preference', 'women&apos', 's health']",NCI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,F32,2004,52492,135941803,0.016439850478119862
"Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Assessing whether items are biased against minority groups is very important for the validity of measurement scales in cancer control and in health sciences in general. Although we have scales to measure beliefs (based on the Health Belief Model) that are predictive of cancer screening behavior, we do not know the extent of cultural bias. Thus, we are missing a critical component in the assessment of psychometric validity. The statistical techniques for detecting item bias are called procedures for detecting differential item functioning (DIF). Under certain conditions, two of the most commonly-used DIF procedures, logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel, can inaccurately display inflated Type I error. The primary purpose of the present methodological proposal is to improve power and Type I error of both the logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel procedures by using alternative matching scores other than traditional summed-item score. Using existing data from two large NIH-funded randomized intervention trials to increase mammography screening (ideal because of equal percentages of Caucasians and African-Americans), we will address these aims: (1) Using computer simulations based on the data structure for generalizing results to breast cancer screening belief scales, we will evaluate the extent to which innovative modifications of logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures control Type I error inflation and improve power, and (2) Using the best modified logistic regression and Mantel-Haenszel DIF procedures (derived from Aim 1), assess items for DIF in the two existing data sets based upon ethnicity, age, education and income in six scales commonly used to predict cancer screening (barriers, benefits, susceptibility, fatalism, self-efficacy, and fear). Improved accuracy of DIF procedures will increase the validity of cancer control scales, providing a firm measurement foundation for advancing the science of cancer control and prevention. Additionally, the findings will have broad applicability to detecting item bias in other scales. n/a",Improving Item Bias Detection in Cancer Control Scales,6889155,R03CA113099,"['analytical method', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'belief', 'bias', 'cancer prevention', 'computer simulation', 'health behavior', 'health disparity', 'human data', 'mammography', 'mass screening', 'method development', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R03,2004,73289,232986943,0.013423772358214436
"Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the percentage of US women who have had at least one mammogram is rising, there is still a cadre of women who have never been screened, and adherence for routine repeat screening that will decrease mortality is poor. We need to identify mammography interventions that are effective for facilitating routine repeat screening, acceptable to women, and cost-effective for health care providers, managed-care organizations and insurers. In previous research, mammography-promotion interventions delivered via computer programs and telephone counseling have each led to increases in screening but, to date, neither their behavioral outcomes nor their cost effectiveness has been evaluated in direct comparison with each other.  This study will compare outcomes from a mammography intervention delivered by computer (CD-ROM) versus telephone. Approximately 1,686 women who are age-eligible for mammography, enrolled in a managed care organization or a large insurance plan, and have not had a mammogram within the previous 15 months will be enrolled in the study. Women will be randomly assigned to receive: (1) a mammography promotion intervention delivered via interactive computer program; (2) the intervention delivered via telephone; or (3) usual care. Computer and telephone interventions will be tailored to recipients' perceptions of susceptibility, benefits and barriers associated with mammography, and perceived self-efficacy for obtaining a mammogram. Women in the computer and telephone groups will receive ""booster"" interventions 12 months after their first intervention.  We will conduct process and outcome evaluations. Outcomes will include mammography adherence and stage of mammography adoption and intervention cost-effectiveness. A logistic regression model will be used to compare the binary outcome of mammography screening adherence by the primary predictor of intervention group, with age, race, and site and their interactions used as covariates. Stage of mammography adoption will be tested using logistic regression with ordinal outcome. Traditional cost and marginal cost-effectiveness analyses are planned. n/a",Promoting Breast Cancer Screening Via Computer V Phone,6825152,R01NR008434,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'cost effectiveness', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'neoplasm /cancer education', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'nursing research', 'patient oriented research', 'telemedicine', 'therapy compliance']",NINR,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2004,100000,232986943,0.0190069588345053
"Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program (NC-BCSP) has conducted a ten-year effectiveness trial of a natural helper lay health advisor intervention in 10 counties (5 interventions, 5 comparisons) in eastern North Carolina to increase mammography use by low-income, rural, African American women. Three waves (baseline and 2 follow-ups) of interview data collected from a stratified random sample of, initially, 1000 Black women (500 intervention, 500 comparison) indicate that NC-BCSP's lay health advisor intervention was modestly effective overall after 30 months (at first follow-up IT2] in 1997), and associated with a greater increase in recent mammography use among specific subgroups, particularly women with annual family incomes under $12,000.  The proposed exploratory study uses all three waves of cohort data to determine: 1) whether NC-BCSP's intervention effect was sustained over the full 8 years of the evaluation (T1-T3), and for which subgroups; 2) what factors are associated with, and what pathways mediated, the intervention's effect initially (T1 - T2,) and in the second follow-up period (T2-T3); 3) how successfully an existing administrative data set (Medicare) can be used, instead of self-report data, to evaluate intervention effectiveness; and 4) whether geographical proximity, as measured by GIS software, of lay advisors to cohort respondents can serve as a useful proxy for self-report measures of exposure to the lay advisors. Analyses will use multivariate models with logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to account for repeated mammography reports.  The proposed secondary analyses of this unique longitudinal data set will provide valuable insights for designing more effective, better targeted, and more cost-effective interventions to reach the hardest-to-reach rural women still not being screened regularly. The goal of this grant is to understand the differences between continuous users, backsliders, late adopters and non-users of screening mammography, and the mechanisms, which explain variation in these groups' exposure to the intervention and their use, or non-use, of mammography. n/a",Secondary Analysis of NC-BCSP Mammography Use Evaluation,6707741,R21CA098934,"['African American', 'Medicare /Medicaid', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'clinical research', 'early diagnosis', 'female', 'geographic difference', 'health behavior', 'health care referral /consultation', 'health care service availability', 'health care service evaluation', 'health care service utilization', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'longitudinal human study', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mammography', 'medically underserved population', 'physicians', 'rural area', 'social support network']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2004,131400,0,0.010235824971267708
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By.

"Prospective study on viral load of cervical cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective is to bring about prevention of cervix cancer through improved biologic understanding and more cost-effective screening strategies. Although human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer, it is incompletely known if viral load of HPV influences progression from cancer in situ (CIS) to invasive cancer and/or interacts with genetic factors. Since clinical intervention precludes direct observation of this progression. unconventional approaches are needed. Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears). HLA and C trachomatis will be analyzed in the first smear from all included women.

"A GIS Based Workbench to Interpret Cancer Maps   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will develop and test a           methodology for identifying regions of excess cancer burden for breast and           colorectal cancer in Iowa. It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.

"Colorectal Screening in Vietnamese : A Controlled Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project is designed to increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans in Northern California through an intervention focused on educating Vietnamese American public and their health care providers. The objective of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Vietnamese American men and the fourth in women. The rate of colorectal screening is low among Vietnamese Americans; only 35 percent of Vietnamese have ever had a fecal occult blood test. The aims of this project are: 1) increase colorectal cancer screening among Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 through a multifaceted intervention; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by following longitudinal cohorts in a controlled trial; 3) identify predictors of screening.   The primary hypotheses are that the proportions of Vietnamese Americans ages 50 to 74 who 1) have ever had a colorectal cancer screening test; or 2) are up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening will increase more in the intervention population than in the control. The intervention will be carried out over 24 months in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties, California with Vietnamese Americans in Harris County, Texas serving as the control population. Building on the ""Pathways"" conceptual framework and our preliminary qualitative and quantitative research findings, the intervention will promote colorectal cancer screening by: 1) reaching Vietnamese Americans through a print and electronic media campaign that will distribute Vietnamese language health education information; and 2) reaching health care providers with Vietnamese-language counseling materials, training videos, and continuing medical education seminars. We will conduct formative research using focus groups to develop culturally appropriate materials (booklets, calendars, posters, and a web site) and products for distribution through Vietnamese-language media (newspaper, television, and radio advertisements). We will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention by comparing rates of screening using pre- and post intervention surveys. To test the primary hypotheses we will use z-tests to determine if the differences in the change in rates (deltas) between the intervention and control populations are statistically significant.

"The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Study Objectives and Specific Aims: This study's objective is to ensure that elderly cancer patients receive the highest quality care for their non-cancer conditions in conjunction with their cancer care, thereby improving their quality of life and maximizing their survival. Most elderly cancer patients enter the cancer care system with a broad range of medical conditions. Little information is available on cancer patients' receipt of non-cancer care. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to compare the receipt of non-cancer care (recommended preventive care, care for chronic medical conditions, and elective surgical procedures) among colorectal cancer patients compared to an age/sex matched non-cancer cohort, 2) to compare receipt of noncancer care among colorectal cancer patients before and after their cancer diagnosis, 3) to identify the patient, tumor, physician/health system, and environmental factors associated with non-cancer care use among colorectal cancer patients, 4) to determine whether receipt of recommended preventive or chronic disease care is associated with improved overall survival among colorectal cancer patients, and 5) to identify the physician specialties providing the most care to colorectal cancer patients. Research Design and Methods: This study will use a retrospective cohort design to evaluate receipt of non-cancer care among colorectal cancer patients and non-cancer controls. This secondary database analysis will use Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data on stage I-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 linked with 1991-2001 Medicare claims data and the American Medical Association Master file. Data for controls will be provided by the 1991-2001 Medicare claims for the 5 percent sample of Medicare beneficiaries living in the SEER areas. We first will define preventive, chronic disease, and elective surgical care measures using claims data, then compare non-cancer care both before and after cancer diagnosis, as well as between the cancer and non-cancer cohorts. We will use logistic regression analyses to identify the factors associated with receipt of non-cancer care, and survival analysis to determine whether there is an association between receipt of preventive and diabetic care services and survival. n/a",The NonCancer Care of Elderly Colorectal Cancer Patients,6717532,R01CA104935,"['age difference', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bias', 'cancer rehabilitation /care', 'chronic disease /disorder', 'clinical research', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'comorbidity', 'disease /disorder onset', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'health care quality', 'health care service availability', 'health disparity', 'health services research tag', 'human data', 'human old age (65+)', 'human population study', 'medical rehabilitation related tag', 'medically underserved population', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient care', 'patient care personnel relations', 'physicians', 'surgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2004,468563,533302350,0.06631587584909678
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention.

Our main specific aims are to ; 1) quantify the absolute and relative risks for CIS and invasive cancer as a function of time since detected HPV and HPV 16 high viral load, 2) assess whether persistent HPV 16 high viral load is a determinant for development of CIS and invasive cancer, 3) assess whether the specific HLA DQ6/DR15 haplotype is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer, and if the association is mediated via a higher viral load and/or persistence of HP V. and 4) assess whether Chlamydia infection is associated with risks for CIS and invasive cancer. Building on experience from an earlier study of CIS (funded by NCI). we will take advantage of unique prerequisites in Sweden created by extensive population-based PAP smear screening documented in computerised registers. ascertainment of all incident cases of CIS and invasive cancer. and access to archival smears and tissue specimens. Using a nested design in this large study base with up to 25 years of complete follow-up, we will identify 600 women with invasive cancer, 600 women with CIS and 600 individually matched control women to each case-group. Using validated and sensitive PCR assays, the presence of viral DNA - and for HPV 16, also the viral load -will be analyzed in all available smears from each participant (on average four per individual, giving a total of about 9600 smears). HLA and C trachomatis will be analyzed in the first smear from all included women.

"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6603279,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2003,428953,61416950,0.037172142994587376
"A GIS Based Workbench to Interpret Cancer Maps   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will develop and test a           methodology for identifying regions of excess cancer burden for breast and           colorectal cancer in Iowa. It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.           Stochastic variations will be computed using Monte Carlo simulation methods.         Regions will be identified using modified, geographic feature extraction             methods. The methodology will be validated in Iowa and, in year three, plans         will be developed for its adoption and implementation in two other states with       strong cancer registries belonging to the North American Association of Cancer       Registries.

"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.

"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6637934,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2003,611480,593605914,0.03489647740259324

The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders. TLC-M users in both studies will be queried regarding their             satisfaction with TLC-M.                                                                                                                                                  n/a",AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY,6514314,R01CA084447,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' biomedical automation', ' clinical research', ' clinical trials', ' computer assisted patient care', ' counseling', ' female', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' telecommunications', "" women's health""]",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2002,405159,61416950,0.037172142994587376
"A GIS Based Workbench to Interpret Cancer Maps   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research will develop and test a           methodology for identifying regions of excess cancer burden for breast and           colorectal cancer in Iowa. It will refine measures of geographic access to           cancer prevention, treatment, and screening services in Iowa by computing            values using fine-scaled geographic data on individuals, the spatial choices of      individuals, and the locations of services providers, It will use Iowa Cancer        Registry (SEER) data for a ten year period (1900-1999) and linked patient files      to Medicare and selected medical insurance records. It will compute statistical      models from the family of logistic regression models to associate specific           cancer burden measures to predictor vanables that capture local characteristics      of the area and characteristics of the individuals. The cancer burden measures       for breast and colorectal cancer are stage at diagnosis, five-year survival,         and probability of screening. The methodology will develop a regional                simulation workbench (RSW) to generate the expected range and variations in the      cancer burden measures for small geographic areas of Iowa based on local             demographic characteristics of the area and statewide cancer burden rates.           Stochastic variations will be computed using Monte Carlo simulation methods.         Regions will be identified using modified, geographic feature extraction             methods. The methodology will be validated in Iowa and, in year three, plans         will be developed for its adoption and implementation in two other states with       strong cancer registries belonging to the North American Association of Cancer       Registries. Results can be used to plan more appropriate cancer prevention and       control programs.

"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.  Then they will be offered a concentrated intervention.  A STD-Prevention Framework derived from a tested nursing model, Cox's Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior, will guide the overall intervention and the components.  Analyses include change scores, logistic regression, proportional odds regression and random regression analysis.  n/a",STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,6539375,R01NR004836,"['AIDS /HIV test', ' African American', ' HIV infections', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' clinical research', ' communicable disease control', ' counseling', ' female', ' health behavior', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' low socioeconomic status', ' nursing intervention', ' sex behavior', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' substance abuse related behavior', "" women's health"", ' young adult human (21-34)']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2002,467931,148463823,-0.03747192127378555
"Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion   DESCRIPTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is extremely prevalent among low-income,       urban pregnant women. The current standard of medical care does not involve          screening pregnant women for BV unless clinical symptoms are reported; however,      the majority of pregnant women with BV are asymptomatic. A number of studies         have found associations between BV and late pregnancy outcomes; such as,             preterm labor, premature rupture of membrane, chorioamnionitis, and low birth        weight. The impact of BV on the risk for spontaneous abortion (SAB) is unclear.      In the proposed prospective cohort study, all women will be screened for BV          early in pregnancy regardless of symptoms. The specific aims of this study are       to: 1) characterize the prevalence and predictors of BV in women early in            pregnancy and 2) evaluate whether BV during pregnancy is an important,               independent predictor of SAB. Women attending their first clinical prenatal          care visit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Obstetric Clinic        with a pregnancy of 12 weeks gestation or less as determined by last menstrual       period will be recruited. We will screen all women for bacterial vaginosis and       follow-up through 22 weeks gestation to identify women experiencing a                spontaneous abortion. We will enroll 2200 women over a three year period arid        compare SAB rates for the estimated 400 women found to test positive for BY (20      percent of patients) and the 1600 women found to test negative for By. Baseline      data collection will be standardized and include a structured in-person              interview, a vaginal smear used to detect By, and urine analysis to determine        alcohol, cocaine and cotinine. Follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted      at 22 weeks gestation to determine the status of pregnancy (SAB vs. non-SAB)         and BV diagnosis and treatment. Pregnancy outcome status will also be                ascertained through ongoing review of medical records, pathology logs and birth      certificates. Initial analyses will be exploratory and descriptive,                  characterizing the prevalence and predictors of BV and the risk factors for          SAB. The primary analysis will be logistic regression, with relative risks and       95 percent confidence intervals, to explore whether BV is an independent             predictor of SAB. This study will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the       prevalence of BV among pregnant women and to determine the relationship between      BV and incident SAB.                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Bacterial Vaginosis and Spontaneous Abortion,6536122,R01HD038856,"['African American', ' bacterial disease', ' caucasian American', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' drug detection', ' gestational age', ' human pregnant subject', ' interview', ' mass screening', ' patient oriented research', ' pregnancy', ' spontaneous abortion', ' statistics /biometry', ' telecommunications', ' urinalysis', ' vaginitis', "" women's health""]",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2002,611300,593605914,0.03489647740259324
"Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears Some studies have found Latina women to be a particularly vulnerable population as regards underutilization of preventive services (Anderson and May, 1995, Kirkman-Liff and Kronenfeld, 1992). Given the importance of preventive services, including cancer-screening services to reduce morbidity and mortality, it is important to identify predictors of this under-utilization of services. Barriers specific to immigrant women have been investigated including issues of acculturation, language, and country of origin. However, one factor that has not been explored is the impact of citizenship status. The Expanded Andersen Behavioral Model of Health Services Use is a highly regarded model for explaining health care services utilization. To date, citizenship status has not been included in this model. Citizenship may increase the predictive ability of this model and should be considered for inclusion. The purpose of this research is to test, through applied research, the appropriateness of including a citizenship variable in the Andersen paradigm. This research is designed to examine utilization of preventive services by Latina women living in Los Angeles County with the intent of determining whether citizenship plays a significant role in access, especially for the large Latina immigrant population. Access/ utilization will be measured by appropriate use of the specific cancer-screening test for cancer of the cervix, the Pap smear. A cross-sectional study design using a secondary data source will examine the impact of citizenship on a sample of 1784 Latina women, ages 18 years or older, living in Los Angeles County. The data are from the 1997 Los Angeles County Health Survey which is a population-based, random digit dialing telephone survey of 8,004 households in Los Angeles County. Logistic regression will be performed separately for each of the empirical models. Stepwise regression will facilitate variables being added (forced in) according to the expansion of the initial, simple model. This modeling methodology allows for analysis of changes in the results as the conceptual model is expanded to include additional predictors of Pap smear utilization. The final model will control for approximately 40+ separate factors derived from the Andersen Model that might impact on access/utilization of this preventive service.  n/a",Latinas:  Impact of Citizenship on Access to Pap Smears,6315032,R03HS011273,"['Hispanic Americans', ' United States', ' cervical /vaginal smear', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' female', ' health care service utilization', ' health services research tag', ' human subject', ' immigrant', ' interview', ' named group']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2001,32048,673201228,0.026417098093462495
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.

"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M.

"Growth Factors and Colon Cancer Cell growth and proliferation are central to carcinogenesis.  Scientific evidence that growth hormones, and genetic variants that influence these growth hormones, are importantly related to colorectal cancer is increasing. Furthermore, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF), growth hormones that appear to be important for colorectal cancer, are influenced by previously identified risk factors for colorectal cancer such as body size and physical activity.  In this study we will use existing lifestyle and metabolic exposure data; known tumor mutational status of microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and available germline DNA from an incident colorectal cancer case-control study of approximately 3000 cases and 3000 controls to study how genetic variants that influence growth hormones and cell growth and proliferation relate to development of colorectal cancer and subsequent survival after diagnosis.  The study focuses on genetic and environmental interaction.  Specific genes examined are molecular variants of genes along insulin pathway, including the IGF1 gene, insulin- like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), the insulin receptor substrate gene 1 (IRS-1), the insulin receptor substrate gene-2 (IRS-2); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma gene (PPARgamma), apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE), and the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR).  We hypothesize that these variants are associated with altered risk of colorectal cancer in conjunction with genetic, diet, and lifestyle factors. Specially, we hypothesize that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR interact with dietary such as calcium, vitamin D, sugar, and glycemic index; sunshine exposure, physical activity, aspirin use, and body size to alter risk of colorectal cancer; that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with specific types of mutations in tumors including microsatellite instability and K-ras mutations; and that molecular variants of IGF1, IGFBP3, IRS-1, IRS-2, PPARgamma, ApoE, and VDR are associated with survival after diagnosis.  To test the hypothesis that these variants interact with dietary and other factors, it is necessary to have a large sample size, such as the one available.  Molecular variants of these genes that are involved in the insulin and growth factor disease pathway will be determined.  Statistical analyses will use logistic regression and survival methods.  This study builds on a unique existing resource to study genetic and environmental associations with colorectal cancer.  It will provide insight into colon cancer etiology and therefore avenues to disease prevention.  n/a",Growth Factors and Colon Cancer,6370654,R01CA085846,"['apolipoprotein E', ' aspirin', ' calcium', ' cancer prevention', ' carcinogenesis', ' cell growth regulation', ' cell proliferation', ' colon neoplasms', ' disease /disorder prevention /control', ' gene environment interaction', ' genetic susceptibility', ' growth factor', ' informatics', ' information systems', ' insulin', ' insulin receptor', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' nutrition aspect of cancer', ' nutrition related tag', ' peroxisome proliferator activated receptor', ' somatotropin', ' vitamin D', ' vitamin D receptors']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2001,692093,228951281,0.016543551567417623
"STD PREVENTION FOR AT RISK AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN The purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a 12-month multi-modal Well Woman intervention to prevent new sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among young, low-income African American women with a history of repeated STDs.  The target group lives on or near the Chicago Westside, where women are plagued with some of the highest STD rates in the nation. The Specific Aim is to determine the effects of the randomized, controlled repeated measures trial on (a) the mediating outcomes--STD related social, psychological, and skill/behavioral factors, and (b) the health status outcome-laboratory-confirmed newly contracted STDs.  The intervention is case-managed by advanced practice nurses (APNs) and complemented by a social worker and peer educators.  The intervention has a 2 month intensive phase and a 10-month maintenance phase with evidence- based standardized and individualized STD-prevention strategies: STD diagnosis, treatment, teaching, and support by APNs; STD prevention classes led by peer educators; community referrals and retention strategies by a social worker; and partner classes, counseling, and referrals.  Subjects will be 670 women aged 18-29 years who have an index STD and at least 1 other STD in their histories.  Subject recruitment will occur at 4 publicly supported West Side clinics, and the intervention will be in the West Side Health Center, a new Cook County Health Services facility in the center of the area.  After baseline measures, the women will be randomly assigned to control or intervention groups with the minimization subject distribution procedure, taking into account the history of intravenous drug use, number of sexual partners, sexual violence, and HIV seropositivity.  The control group will have usual care, STD urine screening, HIV testing (offered) and a minimal didactic experience until the 12-month measure is taken.

"DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA Chinese families are particularly in a vulnerable position for domestic violence due to lack of awareness and cultural background.  Few studies have looked at the prevalence and outcomes of domestic violence among the Chinese population, in the US or in China.  The specific aims of the proposed study will focus on: 1) to develop a culturally appropriate instrument for assessing domestic violence against Chinese women in the US and in China; 2) to investigate, document and compare the type and prevalence of domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; 3) to investigate and compare the risk factors for domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and in China; and 4) to examine and compare the mental and physical health outcomes associated with domestic violence in Chinese women in the US and China.  For preliminary instrument development, a total sample of 200 battered Chinese women and staff working with them will be obtained from 3 Asian Women's Shelters in the US and a Women's Federation in China.  A final random sample of 2000 Chinese women will be interviewed in New York Chinatown clinical settings and 4 major hospitals in Fuzhou, China for the abuse prevalence survey. Medical records will be reviewed on at least 120 battered women identified from the prevalence survey in both countries.  The interview instrument for domestic violence screening, which will screen for prior year abuse and lifetime history of abuse and types of abuse, will be designed and tested for reliability and validity prior to the dissertation.  Descriptive statistics and odds ratios will be used to compare types and prevalence of abuse, and multiple logistic regression will be used to determine the risk factors and associated medical conditions and symptoms for cases as compared to controls.  This proposed study will build on the Sponsor's prior and current research in the area with case control studies, and the applicant's preliminary prevalence violence study in China to investigate domestic violence in Chinese population in the US and in China.  n/a",DOMESTIC VIOLENCE--CHINESE WOMEN IN THE US AND IN CHINA,6187489,F31NR007446,"['China', ' Chinese', ' Chinese American', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' case history', ' clinical research', ' culture', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' epidemiology', ' female', ' health', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mental health', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' spouse abuse', ' statistics /biometry', ' violence']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2000,28480,807432003,0.025291567681952284
"INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY TESTICULAR CANCER The trend of increasing testicular cancer incidence is unlikely to be explained by known risk factors such as cryptorchidism. An infectious etiology of testicular cancer has been proposed, based on similarities between the age-specific incidence pattern of testicular cancer and that of other virus-associated malignancies. Only a small number of epidemiologic studies have evaluated this hypothesis, but collective results suggest that exposure to EBV and CMV may relate to testicular cancer risk. Further indirect evidence comes from studies showing increased risk among immunocompromised men, as well as from studies indicating a relation between testicular cancer and history of sexually transmitted diseases. Direct epidemiologic evidence regarding the role of sexually transmitted infectious agents in testicular cancer etiology is limited although suggestive. Using serum collected prospectively, we propose to evaluate the association between antibody response to HSV-2, HPV-16 and 15, HHV-8 and Chlamydia trachomatis on the one hand and the occurrence of testicular cancer on the other. As a secondary aim, we will examine whether the associations between infection with any of these agents and testicular cancer are modified by age. The proposed study is a case-control study nested in a well-defined cohort of men who donated blood samples as part of the JANUS project in Norway. The JANUS project, sponsored by the Norwegian Cancer Society, was established in 1973 for the purpose of prospectively collecting serum to be used in epidemiologic studies of cancer development and cardiovascular disease. As of October 1993, the JANUS serum bank contained 424,938 serum samples from 293,692 individuals, none of whom had cancer at the time of blood sampling. All blood donors to the JANUS serum bank are annually linked, through a unique, individual identification number, with the Cancer Registry of Norway. Eligible cases for the present analysis are male blood donors listed in the Cancer Registry through 1993 with a diagnosis of invasive testicular cancer. For each case, three blood donors, individually matched by age and year at sample collection, have been randomly selected from the JANUS serum bank as controls. A total of 88 case patients and 262 matched controls have been identified and will be included in the proposed analysis. Serum antibody titers against HSV-2, HPV, HHV-8 and C. trachomatis will be determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent and immunofluorescence assays. Individual antibody titer values will be distributed into quartiles based on the distribution of the entire study population. The data will be modeled through conditional logistic regression, taking into account the individual matching. The JANUS cohort provides a unique opportunity to study infectious agents in relation to testicular cancer risk. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the viral origin of testicular cancer using serum collected prior to diagnosis.  n/a",INFECTIOUS ETIOLOGY TESTICULAR CANCER,6173940,R03CA081590,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Scandinavian country', ' age difference', ' antibody titering', ' cancer registry /resource', ' cancer risk', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' herpes simplex virus 2', ' human data', ' human herpesvirus 8', ' human papillomavirus', ' human tissue', ' immunofluorescence technique', ' infection related neoplasm /cancer', ' male', ' mathematical model', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' serum', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' testis neoplasms']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MED CTR,R03,2000,69109,0,0.027559296008207355
"COMMUNITY INTERVENTION TO INCREASE MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING Low-income African American women are at relatively high risk for breast cancer mortality, due in part to their limited mammography use.  The purpose of the proposed stud is to compare the effect of a tailored interactive computer program with a culturally appropriate video on mammography use.  Secondly, this study will assess the effect of a booster tailored interactive computer programed and booster video program that is delivered one year after the initial intervention to improve interval mammography screening.  Finally, the cost effectiveness of both delivery methods will be explored. The design for this study contrasts three groups randomly allocated to tailored interactive computer, video, or control.  Subjects will include 625 African American women ages 41 to 75 years and at 150% poverty or below who have not had a mammogram in the last 18 months. A network of multi service centers located in the poorest areas of a large metropolitan are will serve as resources for recruitment and intervention delivery.  The interactive computer and video programs will build on concepts found to be predictive of mammography in prior work.  The intervention will be delivered to appropriate groups after a baseline interview and again at 12 months for women who are randomly assigned to receive a booster intervention. Only have of the women initially assigned to receive the interactive computer program or video will receive the booster in order to compare the women receiving the booster intervention with women who receive only the initial intervention.  Baseline interviews prior to intervention) will take place in the multi service center and telephone interviews will take place a three times following intervention delivery. l. Women will receive $25.00 following each interview, for a total of $100. This study is developed to have 90% power to detect overall differences in compliance at six months and 21 months.  Mammography compliance will be measured through self-report and facility verification.  Belief variables built into the intervention and measured through validity and reliability.

"AUTOMATED TELE COUNSELING FOR SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (adapted from investigator's abstract): The goal of this project is      to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a computer-based                  telecommunications system for increasing of regular screening mammography among      women ages 50-74. The Telephone-Linked-Communications for Mammography Screening      (TLC-M) is designed to educate, advise and motivate women to have regular            screening mammograms. There will be two versions of the TLC-M: one for women         who are coming due for their annual screening mammogram (""pre-due"" women) and a      second version for women who missed their annual mammogram and who are               ""past-due"" (""past-due"" women). The TLC technology supporting TLC-M has been          successfully used to positively affect patient behavior in medication                compliance, diet and exercise. It uses real human voice to speak over the            telephone; the users communicate by using the touch tone keypad on their             telephones. TLC-M will consist of up to three automated telephone                    conversations. The content of these conversations is based on the                    Transtheoretical Model in which a women's readiness to obtain routine screening      mammograms is assessed. Depending upon the women's intention, barriers for           having mammography are identified and addressed.                                                                                                                          In the proposed project, the investigators will (1) modify a current version of      TLC-M, (2) pretest and modify the system accordingly, and (3) conduct two            linked randomized controlled trials of the effectiveness of TLC-M in increasing      mammography rates in ""pre-due"" and ""past-due"" women. Eligible women will be          ages 50-74 and will have received a screening mammogram six months prior to          entering the study. The researchers will recruit 1,050 participants over 12          months from a general medical practice, using the computer system of an              affiliated radiology department to screen for potentially eligible women,            followed by a telephone and office interviews to determine final eligibility         and to collect baseline data. One month prior to their due date for annual           screening mammography, these women will receive a reminder letter to schedule a      mammogram. In addition, a random sample of 150 of them will use TLC-M. All           participants in this 'pre-due"" intervention will be evaluated 4 months after         their intervention to determine whether they obtained a mammogram. Women who         received the letter only and who did not obtain a mammogram during the               observation period (estimated to be 360 [40 percent of 900]} will enter a            ""past-due"" reminder letter or to use TLC-M. Four months after the                    interventions, participants will be evaluated to determine whether they had a        mammogram. Mammography rates will be determined and compared using logistic          regression to control for potential demographic, medical and behavioral              confounders.
