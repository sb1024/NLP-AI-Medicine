"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record,10214973,K23HL153775,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Angiotensins', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Automation', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Coughing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Cardiac Output', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'hospitalization rates', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193510,550947887
"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000,377931988
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts. We will evaluate the impact of hypothetical lifestyle and clinical risk factors interventions on reducing the racial/ethnic disparities in developing HF. In addition using unsupervised machine learning phenomapping techniques, we will evaluate subtypes of HF and their prognosis, including models stratified by race/ethnicity.",Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration,10228457,R01HL150170,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac Output', 'Caucasians', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Pooling', 'Diagnosis', 'EFRAC', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Risk Factors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Woman', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data harmonization', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic disparity', 'health disparity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'learning network', 'lifestyle factors', 'men', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'sex', 'sex disparity', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,KENT COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,766081,619461
