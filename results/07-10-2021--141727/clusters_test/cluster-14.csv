"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,10114984,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1,197030888
"The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma Abstract Singers are known to be at an increased risk of developing voice disorders and often represent a large percentage of patients who are seen at voice clinics. One of the most common disorders seen in singers is vocal fold nodules that result from chronic trauma to vocal fold tissue, referred to as phonotrauma or phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH). While PVH in singers is thought do be due to the simple increase in vocal demands associated with singing, it continues to be unclear why some singers develop PVH though others do not. One factor that has been shown to be more highly associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders is personality, as described in the “Trait Theory of Voice Disorders.” Testing of this theory has provided empirical evidence that those with PVH score significantly higher on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than individuals with healthy voices. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information about whether personality relates to PVH in a similar way to singers. We hypothesize that singers with PVH will score significantly higher on personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than singers without PVH. Additionally, information is also lacking about whether personality traits correlate with daily vocal behaviors. PVH in singers is often assumed to be the sole result of how the voice is used when singing. Our preliminary work using an ambulatory voice monitor and an automated singing classifier has shown a larger number of significant differences between singers with PVH and normal controls during speaking than during singing across a full week of monitoring. We expect that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be significantly correlated with ambulatory measures that reflect the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load, specifically in speech. We hypothesize that these relationships will be stronger in singers with PVH compared to healthy singers. The goal of the proposed project is to determine if certain personality traits are significantly related to the presence of PVH in singers and/or to the daily vocal behaviors that could contribute to the etiology and pathophysiology of phonotrauma in singers. We will administer a multidimensional personality inventory to singers diagnosed with PVH and vocally healthy matched-singers. We will compare each trait scale for singers with PVH and healthy singers using a t- test and then determine which traits are more predictive of patient status using a stepwise binary logistic regression. Each participant will also be monitored for one typical week using an ambulatory voice monitor. Relationships between personality traits scales and voice-related parameters will be conducted using Pearson's r correlations, and linear multiple regression will be used to determine which traits are the most predictive of vocal behavior. The new knowledge produced by this project could be used to aid in improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vocal nodules in singers, particularly with respect to predicting which singers are at a greater risk for developing vocal fold nodules, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment. Laura Toles PROJECT NARRATIVE Singers are known carry an elevated risk of developing voice disorders, specifically those that are presumed to result from chronic vocal fold tissue trauma such as vocal fold nodules. However, despite the increased voice use requirements of singing, not all singers develop vocal fold nodules. This study aims to identify the influence that personality traits have on ambulatory voice behaviors to differentiate singers with vocal fold nodules from singers with healthy voices. Specifically, we hypothesize that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be more strongly correlated with the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load in speech in singers with vocal fold nodules. We expect that knowledge gained from this project will be useful to improve prevention of vocal fold nodules through prediction of individual risk for singers, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment.",The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma,10371003,F31DC019284,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Behavior', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nodule', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Personality inventories', 'Prevention', 'Risk', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Vocal Cord Nodule', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'social', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tissue trauma', 'trait', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,F31,2021,2500,1683766
"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,10218102,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38527,550947887
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10320271,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'remote screening', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,45000,585067
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036,52157977
"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000,551214295
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10336135,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,100000,558628098
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,10075985,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,100000,63611576
"Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 1  2 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  3  4 One of the most critical gaps in management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the lack of effective  5 methods of early identification in the population. The objective of this study is to leverage data and analytics to  6 improve healthcare outcomes by early detection and risk stratification of NAFLD, before onset of liver-related  7 complications. Artificial intelligence applications in large electronic health records have the potential to identify  8 disease traits before onset of disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that targeted screening with  9 machine-learning models applied to large integrated healthcare datasets can identify individuals with NAFLD 10 and, more specifically, those with a progressive phenotype. We will test the central hypothesis in 2 specific 11 AIMs. First, we will train a machine learning model of NAFLD prediction using multiple longitudinal data points 12 of all health-care encounters of a well-characterized population-based cohort of individuals diagnosed with 13 NAFLD in reference to individuals without NAFLD from the general population. We hypothesize that 14 unsupervised machine learning can identify complex processes and patterns without a human's guidance and 15 discover early comorbidity clusters (“latent traits” present prior to NAFLD development) that reflect a phenotype 16 at risk to develop NAFLD later in life. Second, we will test and optimize the model for the prediction of patient 17 outcomes (development of cirrhosis, liver-related complications and death) in the NAFLD cohort. We 18 hypothesize that machine learning approaches could be used to further stratify patients into subgroups with 19 different disease trajectories, with the goal of identifying those individuals at risk of progressive NAFLD and 20 liver-related outcomes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it expands the 21 analytical toolbox beyond conventional methods to identify individuals with NAFLD using all health-encounters 22 of a large, well-characterized population-based cohort with long follow-up. This proposal is significant because 23 it addresses a critical need of identification and management of the most prevalent chronic liver disease and 24 offers a practical solution to large scale implementation of screening and risk-stratification strategies using 25 routinely collected data. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve the population health in obesity- 26 associated diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will use innovative statistical methodology to improve the understanding of factors that predict an individual’s risk to develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver-related complications using routinely collected data available during the health care course of an individual. The development of effective and accessible tools to predict the risk of future development of liver disease will enable timely intervention to prevent the disease and reduce the burden of illness and mortality associated with obesity. Hence, the proposed research is critically important and relevant to the public health in a disease which affects a quarter of the adult population in the United States.",Digital Phenotyping of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,10188162,R03DK128127,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'care outcomes', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver development', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2021,119250,276703803
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999,228951281
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110,188894159
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,10135919,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'excessive weight gain', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant obesity', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2021,139614,232986943
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated. ADVANCE Kidney Health responds to this need by assembling diverse mentors, interdisciplinary infrastructure and novel engineering technologies to impact career trajectories and develop the new technological cures of tomorrow.",Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health),10230895,R25DK128859,"['Active Learning', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Arizona', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Career Mobility', 'Caring', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Thinking', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Hypertension', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internships', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laws', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motivation', 'Nephrology', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem Solving', 'Ramp', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Solid', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Universities', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'career preparation', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'early experience', 'education research', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'graduate student', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'kidney dysfunction', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'product development', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'summer research', 'technology development', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2021,140400,161094826
"Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors PROJECT SUMMARY Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by persons with dementia (PWD), affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Agitation brings much stress and detriment to patients and caregivers. Treatment of agitation is often pharmacological intervention which can have adverse side effects. There is a great need for identification of early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation so that it can pave the way for proactive management of agitation and lower the burden on caregivers. The overall goal of this project is to address this critical unmet need through the proposed research and mentored training of the applicant. The Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH), under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor), has more than a decade of experience developing and deploying a digital behavioral assessment platform in older adults' homes and has the experience analyzing the data collected in the clinical context of older adults. The scientific goals of this proposal are to develop digital behavioral markers that identify episodes of agitation, identify early behavioral warning signs and environmental precipitants of agitation, and build a risk prediction model of episodes of agitation using environmental and behavioral sensors and techniques from machine learning and time series analysis. The applicant will collect behavioral data from 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living in memory care units and 10 study participants with later-stage dementia living at their own homes using passive infrared motion sensors, wearable actigraphy devices, and bed pressure mats and follow them for 2 years. Such behavioral data will be used to identify digital behavioral markers that indicate or predict episodes of agitation. The applicant will also collect environmental data (ambient light level, noise level, temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure) from their living environments, and such data will be used to identify environmental precipitants of agitation. In order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career, the applicant will be trained through taking courses and attending workshops in the following areas: (1) the different diagnosis and standard of care for PWD, their neuropsychiatric symptoms and their precipitants; (2) methods of using technology in dementia research; (3) novel methods from deep learning and time series analysis for building risk prediction models of agitation; and (4) development of professional skills for conducting successful and ethically responsible clinical research. The proposed team of mentors and consultant each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are together committed to collaboratively facilitating the applicant's training. The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01 support in order to use the methods for detecting and predicting episode of agitation to create and explore the effectiveness of early interventions for agitation in PWD. Such findings are likely to lead to improve methods for reducing and detecting episodes of agitation and ultimately help protect caregivers' physical and mental health while improving dementia care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Agitation is one of the most common and unmanageable neuropsychiatric symptoms among persons with dementia, affecting 45-83% of this ever-growing population. Pharmacological treatment of agitation often has adverse side effects, and time-constrained caregivers cannot reasonably be expected to monitor the patients and take continuous note of the environment to identify precipitants of agitation. The research and training for this Mentored Quantitative Research Development Award will be centered on identifying digital behavioral markers both during and preceding agitation, identifying environmental precipitants of agitation, and building risk prediction models of agitation using data collected from patients with later-stage dementia and their living environment.",Agitation in Alzheimer's Disease: Identification and Prediction Using Digital Behavioral Markers and Indoor Environmental Factors,10190522,K25AG071841,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Assisted Living Facilities', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Controlled Environment', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Family Caregiver', 'Formal caregiver', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Activity', 'Noise', 'Nursing Records', 'Oregon', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Residential Treatment', 'Resources', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging and technology', 'analytical method', 'barometric pressure', 'burnout', 'care providers', 'career', 'caregiver strain', 'deep learning', 'dementia care', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'improved', 'informal care', 'informal caregiver', 'intervention cost', 'memory care', 'motion sensor', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'pressure', 'research and development', 'research study', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'standard of care']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K25,2021,147437,304670088
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10382633,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,148243,550947887
"Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex Project Summary Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects nearly one in four adults in the United States. With recent discov- eries pertaining to cochlear synaptopathy and outer hair cell (OHC) loss in the extended high frequencies, it is clear that much of the early NIHL remains `hidden' under traditional audiological scrutiny. Without early de- tection and intervention, such damage can progress into more severe hearing loss. Thus a critical window for therapeutics/lifestyle changes may go unutilized. However, there are currently no feasible tools that can identify early hearing damage. Prior studies that test the integrity of the auditory afferent pathway have not produced conclusive results. However, short- and long-term noise exposure-related peripheral damage are correlated with changes in the auditory efferent system. Speciﬁcally, hyperactivity in the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and threshold elevation of the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR) have been reported. Given the protective roles of the MOCR and the MEMR through inhibition of peripheral inputs, and their differential changes with damage, we argue that a combined assay of MOCR and MEMR may serve as a marker for early hearing damage in humans.  Using a novel otoacoustic emission (OAE)-based efferent assay, in the proposed studies we aim to (1) eval- uate long-term age-speciﬁc changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure and (2) evaluate short-term changes in efferent and afferent function due to noise exposure. We will investigate the concurrent working of the two reﬂexes across a wide age range (18-50 years) and noise exposure by recruiting individuals from high noise exposure (musicians, veterans, construction workers, farmer) and low noise exposure occupa- tions (students, professors). To evaluate short-term changes due to noise exposure, we will test participants before and after their typical work day. For reliable exposure stratiﬁcation, noise exposure will be objectively quantiﬁed using 5-day sound dosimetry. We will also use the most sensitive afferent measures to allow compari- son with efferent measures. Machine learning approaches will be employed to ascertain relationships among the cochlear, afferent, and efferent function for short- and long-term noise exposures.  Findings from project 1 will reveal if the combined MOCR and MEMR metrics can delineate noise exposure effects from aging, and highlight the relationships among cochlear, afferent, and efferent measures. Findings from project 2 will reveal if long-term noise exposure predicts short-term changes following noise exposure and vice- versa. A better understanding of short- and long-term changes in the auditory system following noise exposure will aid in the development of (1) an objective rapid screening test of the auditory efferents capable of detecting noise exposure-related hearing damage and (2) a statistical model to enable predicting impending damage based on efferent function. Together, these tools will contribute to early detection and promote hearing conservation. Project Narrative This study will investigate the role of the auditory efferents, the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR) and the middle ear muscle reﬂex (MEMR), in short- and long-term noise exposure-related changes in the auditory system. Additionally, statistical models will be developed to understand the relationship between efferent and afferent candidate measures of hearing damage. The outcomes of this study will lay the foundation for a screening test of early hearing damage based on the integrity of the auditory efferent system.",Effects of Lifetime Noise Exposure Viewed Through the Brainstem Reflex Bifocals: Middle Ear Muscle Reflex and Medial Olivocochlear Reflex,10204332,R21DC018108,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Afferent Pathways', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain Stem', 'Clinical', 'Cochlea', 'Cohort Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Protection', 'Hearing Tests', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Legal patent', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Noise-Induced Hearing Loss', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Noise', 'Occupations', 'Outcome Study', 'Outer Hair Cells', 'Participant', 'Peripheral', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rapid screening', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Students', 'System', 'Temporary Threshold Shift', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'base', 'clinically translatable', 'cochlear synaptopathy', 'conditioning', 'demographics', 'dosimetry', 'ear muscle', 'farmer', 'hearing impairment', 'middle ear', 'musician', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'professor', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sound', 'therapeutic lifestyle change', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2021,155333,338121506
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900,593605914
"Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States, with over 30,000 new HPV-related-cancers are diagnosed annually. Although HPV vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2006 and recommended for routine vaccination for school-age girls and boys, vaccination rates remain low. One reason that has contributed to low vaccination rates is incorrect “risk perceptions” around HPV vaccines such as the high perceived risks of adverse events or side effects from the HPV vaccine. Incorrect risk perceptions are often rooted in the false information about HPV vaccines that people are exposed to in their daily life, including social media. The impact of social media on health information is substantial. Negative social-media HPV-vaccine information has been found to have an association with low vaccination coverage. Given the negative consequences of false information, there is a need to develop a robust and scalable way to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it propagates and negatively impacts behavior. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to build a model to identify false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter, demonstrate its impact on individual risk perceptions and measure its underlying mechanisms on risk perception formation. We propose a novel approach to leverage machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis, crowdsourcing/expert data annotation, psycholinguistic analysis and statistical modeling to investigate the false HPV-vaccine information collectively (in terms of its detection and propagation patterns) and individually (in terms of its impact and underlying cognitive mechanisms). Our study will first build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on Twitter. By modeling the domain-specific HPV- vaccine related text content, information-veracity related linguistic features, individual and collective user behaviors, and dissemination patterns, our model will be able to detect false HPV-vaccine information before it gets verified and spreads widely. We will then investigate the impact of false HPV-vaccine information on risk perceptions around HPV vaccination operationalized by natural language processing methods and a developed HPV-vaccine Risk Lexicon. We will further conduct psycholinguistic analysis on the false HPV-vaccine information and use statistical modeling to uncover the underlying mechanism of risk perceptions. Our study will make a critical and timely contribution to identifying the false HPV-vaccine information and its impact, which has the potential to be applied to other health topics. This proposed project will also address the National Cancer Institute priorities in promoting HPV vaccines and combating misinformation in cancer prevention and control. PROJECT NARRATIVE The uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in part because of incorrect perceptions of vaccination risks, which has been linked to the spread of false HPV-vaccine information. The proposed study seeks to build a computational model to detect false HPV-vaccine information on social media (Twitter) and determine its impact on risk perceptions of the HPV vaccine. The findings will provide important contributions to understand the impact of false health information on HPV vaccination behavior and could be expanded to other health topics.",Identifying False HPV-Vaccine Information and Modeling Its Impact on Risk Perceptions,10114245,R21CA237483,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Individual', 'Information Dissemination', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Politics', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'School-Age Population', 'Semantics', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'boys', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'girls', 'high risk', 'information model', 'information processing', 'multilevel analysis', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'risk perception', 'side effect', 'social media', 'theories', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2021,174255,76545728
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500,14237512
"Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications. For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1. Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding. NARRATIVE Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain glycemic control results in a number of secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness. A reversible glucose responsive insulin (GRI) would represent a significant improvement in diabetes care for both T1D and T2D patients. The success of this project will result in clinical candidates that will ultimately supplant basal and prandial insulins while simultaneously improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemic incidences known to increase cardiovascular risk as well as secondary complications.",Novel Glucose Responsive Insulin for Improved Treatment of Diabetes,10250801,R43DK126521,"['Adult', 'Affinity', 'Amputation', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Calorimetry', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Fructose', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypoglycemia', 'IGF1 gene', 'Incidence', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Leucine', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neuropathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rapid screening', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Somatomedins', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Trees', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Valine', 'Xylose', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'carbene', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical candidate', 'computational platform', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diabetic', 'drug candidate', 'euglycemia', 'global health', 'glycemic control', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'insulin Wakayama', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milligram', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'phase 2 study', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard of care', 'success', 'type I diabetic', 'vigilance', 'web server']",NIDDK,"AMIDEBIO, LLC",R43,2021,183955,816607
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548,2238991
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidate’s career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Innovative technologies for active surveillance of older adults with low-risk skin cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the number one cancer diagnosed in the US each year and accounts for more cases than all other cancers combined.1,2 Most BCCs are not dangerous, as they typically grow slowly and rarely metastasize or affect quality of life. Because cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is a major cause of these lesions, BCCs are considered a non-lethal disease of aging, with the vast majority occurring in people 65 years or older. Despite the low risk BCCs present to patients, in the US all lesions are usually treated. Though existing treatments are effective,3,4 post treatment complications are common; in one prospective cohort study 27% of patients reported a problem after a procedure.5 Moreover, over 100,000 BCCs are treated annually in persons who ultimately die within one year of unrelated causes.6 For patients near the end of life, who often manage multiple health issues, treating these lesions may expose them to the associated medical risks with little potential benefit.7  There is a pressing need to reduce over-treatment and instead develop safe and effective active surveillance methods for low risk BCC in older patients. This research aims to fundamentally change the current “one size fits all” standard of care for treatment of BCCs, which is particularly problematic for older adults.6,8,9 The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care. For the first step of the proposed research, we will refine an existing artificial intelligence algorithm and mobile app to optimize it for at-home active surveillence use for older adults with low-risk BCC. We will then conduct pre-testing with a small group of patients and caregivers (n=15) to iteratively improve the app and ensure usability. Finally, we will compare the data collected via the app to that collected during routine clinical visits. Over a 9-month period, we will follow participants (n=30) with low-risk BCC who have selected an active surveillance option. We will collect data monthly through the app, and every 3 months through in-person clinic visits. We will evaluate patient satisfaction and clinical course to determine the feasibility of using a mobile app for active surveillance of low-risk BCC. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this application is to develop a mobile app for safe, home-based active surveillance of low-risk basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). We hypothesize that home-based active surveillance of low risk BCCs would reduce unnecessary surgical procedures, complications and burdensome clinic visits in patients whose BCCs are not changing, while ensuring that patients whose BCCs grow or become symptomatic receive prompt care.

"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10171553,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serology test', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2021,201875,685608202
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",10140254,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,202259,550947887
"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications. With the data generated through this registry, we will add to the generalizable knowledge about implant therapy, the complications and therapies associated with implant success at the fixture level and the patient level.",A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network,10101988,UG3DE030090,"['Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Budgets', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Dental General Practice', 'Dental Implants', 'Dentistry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Esthetics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral health', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Private Practice', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical practice', 'data registry', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health related quality of life', 'medical specialties', 'peri-implant bone loss', 'peri-implantitis', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'practice-based research network', 'recruit', 'restoration', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,UG3,2021,202410,325573502
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

"Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The National Institute of Health report Diabetes in America (2018) noted that 39.5% of adults with diabetes are aged ≥ 65 years, and the prevalence of diabetes in older adults is dramatically increasing. Management of diabetes in older adults in nursing homes is challenging due to this population having heterogeneous comorbid medical conditions, and associated medications, many of which are contraindicated for common antidiabetic drugs. Intensive diabetes management in older adults is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Drug induced hypoglycemia is the 3rd most common adverse drug event among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. Hypoglycemia is experienced by 18% to 40% of nursing home residents. There is a lack of observational or clinical evidence pertaining to antidiabetic treatments in long-term care nursing home residents, despite this population being at high risk for diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and adverse effects of antidiabetic drugs. The American Diabetes Association’s consensus report on diabetes in older adults noted that “There are essentially no directly applicable clinical trial data on glucose control for large segments of the older diabetic patient population.” Furthermore, there are few real-world studies of antidiabetic treatments in nursing home residents. In recognition of this knowledge gap in this high-risk population, the Diabetes Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee, as reported in the NIDDK Recent Advances & Emerging Opportunities (2019), issued a call for studies that increase our understanding of diabetes treatments in long-term care settings, with a particular emphasis on the need to understand the impact of cognitive and functional impairments, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and risk of hypoglycemia. These priorities are central to our proposed scope of research. Using the Federally-mandated Minimum Data Set 3.0, linked to Medicare Part A and D claims, the aims are to: 1) characterize antidiabetic treatment practices among nursing home residents; 2) identify and describe clinically relevant phenotypes of diabetic nursing home residents based on patterns of cognitive/functional impairments, comorbidities, and treatment procedures/medications, and 3) estimate the occurrence of hospitalizations (overall, hypoglycemia-related, and hypoglycemia-specific) by propensity- matched patterns of antidiabetic treatments, across resident phenotypes. We hypothesize that risks associated with antidiabetic treatments will be heterogeneous across resident phenotypes. We anticipate that the phenotypic approach we propose will serve as a foundation for future work to conduct phenotypic-specific comparative effectiveness research in support of evidence-based personalized antidiabetic treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nursing home residents have a high prevalence of diabetes and high risks of diabetes complications. There is limited observational or clinical evidence supporting antidiabetic treatment decisions in long-term care nursing home residents. This study will examine the use and safety of antidiabetic treatments across subgroups (phenotypes) of older nursing home residents with diabetes.",Diabetes Treatments and Hypoglycemic-Related Adverse Events in Nursing Home Residents,10137311,R21NR019160,"['Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Age Distribution', 'Age-Years', 'American', 'Americas', 'Antidiabetic Drugs', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Coin', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Home Nursing Care', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Long-Term Care Nursing', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Medication Management', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse event risk', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'diabetes management', 'diabetes risk', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'human old age (65+)', 'instrument', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'novel', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized medicine', 'trend', 'virtual']",NINR,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2021,209375,294146927
"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'nutrition', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796,673201228
"Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is responsive to NIH solicitation PA-17-089 for projects involving secondary analysis of pre-existing geriatric datasets. While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, existing literature indicates that early diagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There is a pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individuals at Alzheimer’s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (including microarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliest observable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the need for noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic) preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleep features derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposing to perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well- suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG, and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow “on-the-go” sleep monitoring. The combination of these on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer’s diagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latent characteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA data resource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators of health status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deep learning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is a longitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. To address any concern about the “black-box” nature of deep learning models, we will compare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classical statistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject’s apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoE4) allele carrier status influences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this by incorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. The on-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have a significant impact on early Alzheimer’s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease before the onset of symptoms would be critically important for disease management and therapeutics. In this R21 Exploratory Analyses Grant, we propose to develop and validate state-of-the-art deep learning tools to discover novel sleep-based predictors for Alzheimer’s disease through secondary analysis of sleep, activity, and cognitive data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort of human subjects.",Sleep metrics from machine learning for Alzheimer's disease diagnostics,10221599,R21AG068890,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nature', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research Design', 'Route', 'Series', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'aging brain', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'carrier status', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sleep pattern', 'sleep quality', 'sociodemographic variables', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R21,2021,217797,7208224
"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000,9132113
"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG.

"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663,0
"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Bladder', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Invaded', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannosides', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Uropathogenic E. coli', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'de novo mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleobase', 'pathogen', 'recurrent infection', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'time use', 'tool']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500,327644200
"Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the aging population and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, including cerebrovascular injury. Repetitive exposure to acute CV response, such as sympathetic surge and blood pressure (BP) rise following obstructive respiratory events, is an important mediating mechanism linking OSA to CV disease and cerebrovascular injury. However, such acute CV responses are not effectively captured by conventional polysomnography metrics, such as the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) commonly used in OSA evaluation. This results in imprecise classification of patients in terms of their CV risk and may be responsible for inconsistent results in epidemiologic and clinical studies. More importantly, the uncertainty of the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing the CV risk poses a significant challenge in therapeutic decision-making in older individuals. Therefore, the identification of additional phenotypic markers that better quantify the unfavorable CV effects of OSA and provide improved prediction of CV outcomes is crucial to improving risk stratification and clinical therapeutic decision-making. Herein, we propose to study novel physiologic measurements that can readily be retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether PPG features are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CV disease, and cerebrovascular injury. We will extract PPG features from polysomnography obtained in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study and examine whether PPG features are associated with CV outcomes, including left ventricular mass, aortic stiffness, and incident cardiovascular events, as well as markers of cerebrovascular injury, including brain structural abnormalities by MRI and cognitive impairment by Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument in the older men and women. We will compare the association of PPG features with these outcomes with that of conventional OSA assessment metrics (such as apnea hypopnea index). The main PPG feature of interest is slope transit time. To assess the utility of the various PPG features for use in estimating and classifying outcomes, we will use novel machine learning methods, such as are based on the GNOSIS (Generalized Networks for the Optimal Synthesis of Information Systems) information-theory-based modeling tool. Subsequently, we will determine how PPG features predict BP treatment response to CPAP and O2 therapy using data from the HeartBEAT randomized controlled trial. This study attempts to identify novel PSG metrics that are cardiovascular-centric and to assess their clinical utility in the older adults. The findings of the study will provide a basis for further development of a simpler method by which to assess and monitor OSA. Considering the high prevalence of OSA in older populations, coupled with its impact on adverse health outcomes, the proposal has significant public health implications. Project Narrative Currently used conventional metrics for sleep apnea assessment has many limitations including insufficient consideration of acute cardiovascular response to sleep apnea event. We propose to study a novel physiologic measurements that can be readily retrieved from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and investigate whether they are associated with markers of subclinical, clinical CVD and neurocognitive outcomes. We will use data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep study to evaluate PPG features in their associations with outcomes and examine whether these features help identify people who respond better to CPAP therapy in terms of blood pressure in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) randomized controlled trial data.",Photoplethysmography Analysis to Assess Cardio-Cerebrovascular Impact of Sleep,10266835,R21AG070576,"['Acute', 'Apnea', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Continuous Positive Airway Pressure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Heart', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Information Theory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Left Ventricular Mass', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Older Population', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Polysomnography', 'Public Health', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea Syndromes', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'aging population', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'older men', 'older women', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'sensor', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2021,273213,533302350
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671,327644200
"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889,127562714
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000,0
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138,377931988
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,10080731,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural area', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'underserved area', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,351666,148463823
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587,533594881
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10236819,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,354795,28663340
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10159296,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,376064,533302350
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC ABSTRACT Head and neck cancer is one of the most prevalent aggressive cancers worldwide, with the majority being squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), or HNSCC. The well-known risk factors associated with the genesis of HNSCC include human papillomavirus and environment factors including tobacco and alcohol use. Despite more than two decades of research into the molecular genetics of HNSCC, there is still lack of prognostic biomarkers that can guide current treatment and management of HNSCC patients. Previous studies and our preliminary analysis showed that top immune-centric biomarkers had the most promising prognostic value for HNSCC patients compared to other immunotherapy-favorable cancers such as skin and lung cancers. In this R01 project, we propose a large-scale secondary analysis of existing transcriptomic and genetic data to elucidate the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in head and neck cancer. The underlying central hypothesis is that tumor-intrinsic and host-intrinsic immune signaling co-modulate the effectiveness of existing therapies in HNSCC; and elucidation of the interaction between targeted genomic/genetic alternations and background tumor-immune signatures via efficient statistical and machine learning methods can lead to novel prognostic biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we propose three specifics aims. In the first aim, we will generate HNSCC-specific immune signatures by integrating single-cell and bulk-tumor transcriptomic data using novel machine learning methods developed by our team. In the second aim, we will discover and prioritize immune-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers by recalling existing transcriptome data and applying an efficient genome-wide screening method. In the third aim, we will combine baseline germline variants with tumor immune signatures and further examine its prognostic value in patients treated by immune checkpoint blockade (provide by multiple institutes including Moffitt, OSU and UNC). Collectively, we propose the most extensive study to date in HNSCC investigating under-investigated element of the genomics source for predicting clinical and tumor immune phenotypes. The new omics data resource and resulted biomarkers, especially the immune-related biomarkers, from our research have potential to impact upon the diagnosis and prognosis of HNSCC patients and could guide more efficient and personalized immunotherapy selection in the future. NARRATIVE There is a pressing and unmet need to identify prognostic biomarkers in head and neck cancer. By repurposing existing genomic data available in public databases and at Moffitt, we propose the first large-scale study investigating the potential of immune mechanistic signatures and their mediators as biomarkers in predicting patient survival outcomes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Such knowledge may lead to improved identification of patient subgroups for development of novel and targeted therapies in HNSCC.",Investigating the prognostic role of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in HNSCC,10184419,R01DE030493,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Biological Markers', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dissection', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune signaling', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Domains', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Tobacco use', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Tumor Markers', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'conventional therapy', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'exhaustion', 'functional group', 'genome wide screen', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenic', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'lymphoid structures', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survival outcome', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NIDCR,H.

"Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework Project Summary / Abstract The proposed research aims to develop novel causal inference methods to resolve unmeasured confounding bias known to plague vaccine effectiveness and safety studies by leveraging so-called negative control variables widely available in vaccine studies. A negative control outcome is a variable known not to be causally affected by the treatment of interest, while a negative control exposure is a variable known not to causally affect the outcome of interest. Both share a common confounding mechanism as the exposure-outcome pair of primary interest. Examples of negative controls abound in vaccine studies. Such known-null effects form the basis of falsiﬁca- tion strategy to detect unmeasured confounding, however little is known about when and how negative controls can be used to resolve unmeasured confounding bias. We plan to develop principled negative control methods for identiﬁcation and semiparametric estimation of causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, incorporating modern highly adaptive machine learning methods. We also plan to develop negative control meth- ods to detect and quantify causal effects in complex longitudinal and survival settings critical to vaccine studies using routinely collected healthcare data. Finally we plan to apply the proposed methods to evaluate vaccine effectiveness using data collected from a pioneering test-negative design platform and to monitor vaccine safety using electronic health record data. Successful completion of the proposed research will equip investigators with paradigm-shifting methods to unlock the full potential of contemporary healthcare data, encourage investigators to routinely check for evidence of confounding bias, and ultimately improve the validity of scientiﬁc research. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop statistical methods to detect and resolve unmeasured confounding bias by leveraging prior knowledge about known-null effects widely available but often underappreciated in healthcare data — thereby facilitating valid and reproducible research in vaccine effectiveness and safety studies.",Accounting for Hidden Bias in Vaccine Studies: A Negative Control Framework,10093358,R01GM139926,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Plague', 'Plague Vaccine', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'adverse event risk', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'public health priorities', 'safety study', 'semiparametric', 'theories', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine evaluation', 'vaccine safety', 'vaccine trial']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,401613,641965656
"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421,148186688
"Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY  Metabolite levels in human blood are regulated by a relatively strict system of homeostatic control. Previous investigations of homeostasis have taken a number of approaches, and models of glucose and a few other metabolites have been developed, typically focused on a single organ. However, while potentially extremely useful, an accurate and quantitative model of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis does not currently exist.  It is well known that numerous demographic and clinical factors such as gender, age, BMI, smoking, etc., as well as pre-analytical factors and many diseases, significantly affect the levels of blood metabolites. Numerous studies in the field of metabolomics have attempted to account for the effects of many such factors. However, efforts to quantify these effects and validate them across different studies have so far been challenging, and resulted in consistent failures to validate discovered putative biomarkers. The challenges to integrate metabolite profiles with clinical and demographic factors are complicated by the high dimensionality of the data and the numerous correlations among the metabolites. Traditional statistical methods are incapable of accounting for these factors, and hence, investigations suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR).  To overcome these challenges, we propose to develop quantitative statistical models of blood metabolite levels in healthy adults, and thereby produce a predictive model of homeostasis. Our preliminary work indicates that we can predict metabolite levels with much reduced variance using the reproducibly measured levels of a large pool of blood metabolites and clinical and demographic variables. We propose to develop sophisticated models of homeostasis based on advanced statistical methods and evaluate their predictive performance across different sample sets and metabolite classes.  The proposed project has four main Aims: (1) Obtain broad-based metabolomics data on blood samples collected from geographically distinct sites to explore the effects of a range of confounding effects on metabolite levels. (2) Model individual or biologically related groups of metabolite levels using multivariate statistical approaches to determine the contribution of clinical/demographic and pre-analytical variables and their predictability across collection site. (3) Investigate the interactions between metabolites and clinical/demographic variables using machine learning approaches to identify stable metabolites and key interactions. (4) Provide the community with user-friendly software packages for the prediction of blood metabolite levels under homeostasis.  An overall model of the metabolite concentrations in blood will be highly useful for a number of applications that include a better understanding of systems biology at the whole organism level, and ultimately improved risk prediction, disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and outcomes analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE A quantitative model of blood homeostasis based on predicting the normal levels of small molecules in the blood can help identify diseases or other stresses that cause changes to those levels. The proposed statistical methods that will be used to develop this homeostasis model have the potential to efficiently identify more reliable disease markers and to more accurately predict disease risk.",Modeling Homeostasis of Human Blood Metabolites,10372262,R01GM131491,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Gases', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Glucose', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolite Interaction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical effect', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data quality', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'lipidomics', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,431464,533302350
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020,327644200
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10265790,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,449250,415711940
"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence.

"Digital High Resolution Melt and Machine Learning for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis in Neonatal Sepsis Project Summary Blood culture sensitivity in neonates is poor but is the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of sepsis. Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. We have advanced U- HRM into a digital PCR format (U-dHRM), where DNA sequences that are present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified as is needed for polymicrobial infections. We have also established unique signature melt curves for 37 bacterial species that commonly infect older children and adults and automatically identify them using machine learning technology. With the goal of creating an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, we will advance this technology to identify unique fungal, viral, and bacterial HRM signatures along with antibiotic resistance genes with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1mL). Our aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess the U-dHRM platform for neonatal bacteremia diagnosis by expand our bacterial database (13 additional bacteria) to detect causes of >99% of neonatal bacterial infections, expand our antibiotic resistance gene database to include five clinically actionable genes, and assessing the performance of the system for bacteremia diagnosis in mock and clinical whole blood samples; Aim 2. Advance the U-dHRM platform for simultaneous detection of fungal and viral pathogens by upgrading our optical system to enable expansion to fungal and viral detection in a high-throughput format, multiplexing the assay to expand to viral and fungal pathogens causing >99% non-bacterial infections, and conducting analytical validation of the multiplexed platform using mock whole blood samples; and Aim 3. Advance the machine learning algorithm for detection of emerging pathogens by developing and integrating an anomaly detection algorithm for reporting emerging pathogens that are not included in our database and validating the algorithm using data generated in Aims 1 and 2. Thus, this proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to overcome the biomedical challenge of rapidly diagnosis sepsis, a hidden public health disaster. Project Narrative Digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA combined with machine learning creates unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antibiotic resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection and treatment of pathogen(s) causing sepsis. This project will advance and test the clinical performance of dHRM technology in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV- related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC.

"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10089406,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,483863,558628098
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995,499995
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,10134187,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,532141,685608202
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop an automated screening and prediction system that can be widely deployed to identify these individuals at risk of vision loss.",A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration,10172914,R44EY031202,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Antioxidants', 'Blindness', 'Categories', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Drusen', 'Ear', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fees', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Lasers', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modeling', 'New York', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Sun Exposure', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Trademark', 'Treatment Cost', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitamins', 'age related', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care costs', 'checkup examination', 'commercial application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'photobiomodulation', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'remote screening', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal imaging', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'software as a service', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NEI,"IHEALTHSCREEN, INC.",R44,2021,545819,585067
"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and prediction of disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxias.",A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change,10210639,R01NS117826,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Disorders', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Vision', 'arm', 'arm function', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'illness length', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microphone', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oculomotor', 'open source', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555308,551214295
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Shape up! Kids Project Summary/Abstract Of all markers of pediatric health, the most intuitive is body shape. Human and animal studies indicate that weight loss/gain correlates closely with increasing/decreasing insulin sensitivity, respectively. Anthropometry and regional composition measures such as waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and visceral adipose tissue area are better predictors of obesity-related diseases and mortality risk than pediatric body mass index Z-score. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can quantify regional adiposity in more detail than these measures but is underutilized for many reasons including the sensitivity to children to ionizing radiation, cost, and training. A study is needed to take advantage of rapid technological developments in optical technology to better describe phenotypes of pediatric body shape and its relation to metabolic risks (obesity, “failure to thrive”) and bone density and size. If successful, sophisticated obesity phenotype profiles could be constructed to clarify the underlying associations of body composition with disease, genetics, lifestyle exposures, metabolomics, and be highly assessable using self-assessment technology. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Kids Study is 1) to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health using body shape, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in research, clinical practice, and personal health assessment. Our overall approach is to first derive predictive models of how body shape relates to regional and total body composition (subcutaneous fat, visceral fat, muscle mass, lean mass, and percent fat) and bone mineral density (BMD) over a wide range of ages (5 to 18 years), weights and heights, stratified by sex, and ethnicity. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates with shape classification of soft tissue composition and bone density better predict fracture and metabolic risk factors than anthropometry (WC, WHR, and BM) alone. The Investigators will highly leverage existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and Bone Mineral Density in Children Study. Our specific aims are: 1) Identify the unique associations of body shape to body composition and bone density indices in a pediatric population that represents the variance found in the US population, 2) Describe the precision and accuracy of optical scans to monitor change in body composition, bone density, 3) Estimate the level of association of optical scans to common health indicators including metabolic risk factors. Our exploratory aim is to investigate holistic, high-resolution descriptors of 3D body shape as direct predictors of body composition and metabolic risk using statistical shape models and Latent Class Analysis. By the end of this study, we expect to have models of the shape and composition suitable for self-assessment technologies that are capable of representing over 95% of the shape variance in the US pediatric population, and to define how these models relate to important metabolic status indicators. The positive impact of these outcomes will be the immediate applicability to other researcher studies and clinicians using the automated tools and models developed here for 3D optical images. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is relevant to public health because they have the potential to provide a better understanding of what children are at high risk of metabolic consequences of obesity. Thus, the advances proposed are expected to have a high impact to the health and wellbeing of all US citizens because metabolic diseases, such as obesity and its complications, are currently the number one killers of adults, and are becoming epidemic in children as well.

"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability. In this project we will develop novel algorithms and hardware with improved stability to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring,",Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring,10121622,R01EB027122,"['Academia', 'Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Annual Reports', 'Arterial Lines', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Catheters', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Arteries', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'data format', 'data fusion', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'privacy protection', 'recurrent neural network', 'sensor', 'surgical risk', 'technology development', 'tonometry']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,595683,551214295
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779,136810522
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults.

A combination of experiments, theoretical modeling and computer simulations will reveal how mechanical stresses (due to blood flow) in synergy with enzymatic lysis induce structural damage from the molecular to continuum scales and affect the propensity of a clot to embolize. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Measure and model fracture toughness of fibrin gels in quasi-static conditions, (2) Investigate rate dependent dissipative effects on toughness of fibrin gels, and (3) Study the effects of blood cells, prothrombotic blood composition, and fibrinolysis on rupture of blood clots. In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we will measure toughness of fibrin clots and provide a structural basis for rupture at the micron and nanometer scales. In SA2, we will delve into the thermodynamics and rate-dependence of the fracture of fibrin gels, including fluid flow through pores and fluid drag on fibrin fibers to capture how energy dissipation increases toughness. In the translational SA3, we will investigate toughness of physiologically relevant clots with effects of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in the absence and presence of the physiological fibrinolytic activator (tPA). We will also study the rupture of clots made from the blood of venous thromboembolism patients to explore the effects of (pro)thrombotic alterations of blood composition on clot mechanical stability. Our preliminary studies show that i) the toughness of cross-linked fibrin gels is in the range of those for synthetic hydrogels, ii) the addition of tPA to a crack tip reduces the loads for crack growth, iii) fibers are aligned and broken along the tensile direction at the crack tip, and iv) crack propagation results from the rupture of covalent and non-covalent bonds. We also developed v) dynamic force spectroscopy in silico to mechanically test fibrin fibers and fibrin networks using pulling simulations and vi) atomic stress approach to map the stress-strain fields using the output from simulations. We will use continuum and finite element models of swellable biopolymer hydrogels, and statistical mechanical models for the forced unfolding of fibrin molecules. We will employ multiscale computational modeling based on Molecular Dynamics simulations of atomic structures of fibrin fibers, and Langevin simulations of fibrin networks accelerated on Graphics Processing Units. The proposed experiments cover the whole gamut of macroscopic tensile tests, shear rheometry, electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to visualize and quantitate the structural alterations of ruptured blood clots. Our experiments and modeling will help us to understand the mechanisms of thrombotic embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong association between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular diseases? The new knowledge will also help to design new hydrogel-based biomaterials that are currently at the forefront of research in mechanics, materials science and bioengineering. Project Narrative The research objective of this proposal is to measure, model and predict the mechanisms of mechano-chemical rupture of blood clots and thrombi at the molecular and continuum length scales. Our experiments and modeling will help to understand the mechanisms of embolization and will address the clinically important question: why is there a strong correlation between clot structure/mechanical properties and cardiovascular disease?

"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893,415711940
"Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) Biomarkers of Cerebral Cavernous Angioma with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) PROJECT SUMMARY Cerebral cavernous angioma (CA) is a capillary microangiopathy affecting more than a million Americans, predisposing them to a premature risk of brain hemorrhage. Fewer than 200,000 cases who have suffered a recent symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) are most likely to re-bleed again with serious clinical sequelae, and are the primary focus of therapeutic development. Genetic mechanisms of CA have been extensively studied, and consequent signaling aberrations in the neurovascular unit. These include proliferative dysangiogenesis, blood- brain barrier hyperpermeability, inflammation and immune mediated processes, anticoagulant vascular domain, and gut microbiome-driven mechanisms. Plasma levels of molecules reflecting these mechanisms and measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage leak on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been correlated with CA hemorrhage in pilot studies. It would be desirable to optimize these biomarkers to accurately diagnose CASH, to prognosticate the risk of future SH, and to monitor cases after a bleed and in response to therapy. This would influence clinical management, and select higher risk cases for clinical trials. Additional candidate biomarkers are emerging from ongoing mechanistic and differential transcriptome studies, which would be expected to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis and prediction of CASH. Weighed combinations of levels of plasma proteins and characteristic micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNA) may further strengthen biomarker associations. Plasma biomarkers may reflect (and potentially replace) more cumbersome and expensive imaging biomarkers for monitoring CA hemorrhage. We here assemble leading clinical CA researchers and propose to deploy advanced statistical and computational biology approaches (including supervised machine learning) for the integration of novel candidate biomarkers, rejecting non-correlated candidates, and determining the best clustering and weighing of combined biomarker contributions. In Specific Aim 1 we assess these biomarkers in a large CA cohort from multiple sites, to discover the best plasma biomarkers and validate them in sex, age and relevant clinical subgroups. In Specific Aim 2 we compare changes in MRI measures of vascular permeability and hemorrhage with plasma biomarkers over time. In Specific Aim 3 we query the biomarkers in non-CA subjects, to identify potential confounders in the clinical context. This project leverages the synergy of established CA research consortia, and integrates analytic and computational biology expertise to develop blood tests for better CASH diagnosis and prognosis. The project tests a novel integrational approach of biomarker development in a mechanistically defined cerebrovascular disease with a relevant context of use. This approach is applicable to other neurological diseases with similar pathobiologic features. PROJECT NARRATIVE The project assembles leading cavernous angioma researchers with the aim of developing blood tests for the diagnosis and prediction of symptomatic brain hemorrhage, a critical clinical challenge in a disease affecting more than a million Americans. We further examine whether blood biomarkers can replace or enhance the accuracy of advanced imaging in association with lesional bleeding.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.

"Investigating the Systems Genetics of the Patterns of Polysubstance Abuse and Addiction Abstract. Polysubstance Substance Use (PSU) is common among individuals meeting diagnosis for any substance use disorder (SUD) and is defined as the use of two or more addictive drugs. These drug combinations are associated with increased short- and long-term mental and physical health concerns. Due to the high degree of variability in PSU patterns, limited data are available regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying PSU vulnerability. The overall goal of this project is to use novel approaches based on genome-wide data to dissect the fundamental biology of polysubstance abuse and addiction. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will conduct heritability and high-resolution cross-phenotype polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses of probabilities of PSU classes in three moderately-large study populations characterized by a high degree of PSU, our Yale-Penn cohort, the SAGE (Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment) cohort, and the ICGHD (International Consortium on the Genetics of Heroin Dependence) cohort. The PSU pattern will be identified applying latent class analysis (LCA) and a multinomial logistic regression procedure to substance use data available from the SSADDA (Semi-structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism; Yale-Penn Cohort), the SSAGA (Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism; SAGE cohort), and the SSAGA-OZ (SSAGA – Australia; ICGHD cohort). We expect that the R21-Phase analyses will identify heritable PSU patterns and gene sets associated with them, providing the background necessary to investigate PSU in other molecular paradigms. In the R33 phase of the project, we will test the R21-phase results with respect to two different settings: 1) longitudinal PSU data; and 2) PSU-induced epigenetic changes. Re-contacting a sub-sample of the Yale-Penn cohort, we will be able to assess the trajectory of PSU patterns and the consequences of PSU and to test whether the genetic factors associated with the initial PSU status predict the PSU trajectories and consequences. Similarly, we will also test whether heritable PSU correlates with epigenetic changes and whether these mediate health outcomes. The expected results of the R33 phase will provide multiple findings related to the biology of PSU that can improve clinical practice, deliver new therapeutic targets, and open new directions in molecular investigations of PSU. Public Health Relevance Statement. Polysubstance abuse and addiction consist of various combinations of substance use disorders, which by definition reflect the harmful use of two or more addictive substances. The aim of this project is to conduct a genome-wide analysis of polysubstance use patterns and investigate the results with respect to longitudinal data and epigenetic information.",Investigating the Systems Genetics of the Patterns of Polysubstance Abuse and Addiction,10334662,R33DA047527,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Australia', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cannabis', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Combinations', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Heroin Dependence', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'depressive symptoms', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetics of alcoholism', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'physical conditioning', 'polygenic risk score', 'polysubstance abuse', 'polysubstance use', 'prospective', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'statistics', 'study population', 'trait']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R33,2021,671377,550947887
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385,254622553
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863,90419233
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902,197030888
"Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS Abstract  Ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) of the breast are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions that are usually detected by screening mammography. Workup generally includes a percutaneous (core) Biopsy (Bx) for histologic confirmation, followed by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), followed by breast-conserving excision, and adjuvant radiation. Approximately 20-25% of patients with core Bx-confirmed DCIS are upstaged to invasive carcinoma upon pathology of resected tissue. Foreknowledge of this would dictate a more aggressive surgical intervention, including sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging. Further, another 20-25% of patients are judged to have low-risk disease and current thought is that such women may have better outcomes in an active surveillance setting, and this is being tested in clinical trials. The ultimate goal and the overall impact of this project is to use machine learning to identify biochemical (SA1) or imaging (SA2) biomarkers, as well as their combination (SA3) to discriminate indolent from aggressive DCIS, as determined by upstaging upon excisional biopsy.  The major hypothesis to be tested in this work is that hypoxia and expression of hypoxia-related proteins (HRPs) can discriminate aggressive from more indolent DCIS, and that this can be used for decision support. Expression of HRPs is optimally characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we have deployed methods for multiplexed IHC, as well as methods for advanced analytics using machine learning (pathomics). We have also shown that hypoxic habitats within breast cancers can be identified from mpMRI using machine learning (radiomics). We thus propose to use pathomics of core biopsies and radiomics of mpMRI to determine the presence and extent of hypoxic habitats in DCIS prior to surgery to predict subsequent upstaging after surgical resection. This work will be performed in Aim 1 for pathomics and Aim 2 for radiomics, and Aim 3 will develop combined radio-pathomics predictors. Each aim will contain: (a) retrospective arms for training, tuning, and testing; and (b) prospective internal and external cohorts for rigorous validation. For the retrospective studies, we have identified 604 cases wherein women with DCIS obtained core Bx, mpMRI, and surgery with pathology at Moffitt in the last 10 years. Internal prospective studies will accrue ~6 women/month who have consented to the total Cancer Care® protocol and who have their complete workup at Moffitt. External validation cohorts will be accrued at UCSF and at Advent Health.  At the end of this work we will have developed a risk model for DCIS that can be deployed prior to surgery to guide decisions along the spectrum from active surveillance at one end to more extensive surgical intervention at the other. This is expected to lay a foundation for subsequent interventional trials. Additionally, the inclusion of hypoxia as a central hypothesis has high potential to illuminate components of the natural history of this disease. Narrative  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies of the breast and data are lacking with regard to optimal treatment. Consequently, the majority of DCIS are treated in the same manner: i.e. surgery +/- radiation +/- hormonal therapy that results in either over- or under-treatment of many patients. In the current work we will test the hypothesis that histologic or radiologic markers prior to surgery can guide decision support by identifying predicting up-staging and pathological risk scoring following surgical excision.",Radiomics and Pathomics to predict upstaging of DCIS,10120171,R01CA249016,"['Acidosis', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Axilla', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinoma', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consent', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Excision biopsy', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Indolent', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammographic screening', 'Mammography', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Methods', 'Milk', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radio', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resected', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'breast malignancies', 'cancer care', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disease natural history', 'disorder risk', 'hormone therapy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic', 'optimal treatments', 'practical application', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,H.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target. Achieving and maintaining blood pressure target will reduce the incidence of adverse events [stroke (35-40%), heart failure (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (15-25%)] or death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension.",PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target,10159301,R44HL140624,"['Acute', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Confidential Information', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Euclidean Space', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Medical center', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resources', 'Route', 'Safety', 'San Francisco', 'Seminal', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Women&apos', 's Role', 'Work', 'base', 'blood pressure intervention', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'commercial application', 'comparative efficacy', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'hypertension treatment', 'innovation', 'optimal treatments', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'processing speed', 'response', 'stroke incidence', 'stroke risk', 'success']",NHLBI,"OPTIMA INTEGRATED HEALTH, INC.",R44,2021,715983,1405065
"Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation. A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep- dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents (UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS, but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials. A fundamental challenge to finding effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders is the paucity of biomarkers that can gauge whether a potential intervention affects abnormal circuitry early in the treatment development pipeline, before embarking on expensive and lengthy clinical trials. This research proposal will develop novel physiological assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation in humans and rodents that can be used to predict the efficacy of newly emerging treatments. These assays will enable the efficient screening and identification of treatments that can alleviate highly disabling cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",Optimizing sleep spindle measurements as translational assays of memory consolidation,10112344,UG3MH125273,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Eszopiclone', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rodent', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinical candidate', 'density', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'memory consolidation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'screening', 'sleep spindle', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UG3,2021,734247,551214295
"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026,292134808
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction model', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765,685608202
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885,558628098
"Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are typically the result of neurodegenerative processes that begin 15-20 years before clinical diagnosis. Despite this lengthy subclinical phase and advances in early diagnostic technologies including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain MRIs, and positron emission tomography (PET) measures there are no scalable biomarkers to identify individuals with preclinical disease, which may offer the best time window for intervention. Specifically, because brain MRI and PET tests are resource-intensive and CSF sampling is invasive, there is urgent need for biomarkers based on blood samples, which can be non-invasively collected even in centers lacking highly specialized technology. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), unlike the stable nuclear genome, is dynamic and accumulates somatic mutations over the lifespan. Mutations in the mtDNA can be induced by oxidative stress and lead to declining mitochondrial function as we age; in turn, less functional mitochondria generate higher levels of oxidative stress, which induces chronic inflammation and tissue injury in specific organs including the brain. Yet, no study has investigated mtDNA mutations as early predictors of ADRD. We hypothesize that individuals with higher levels and faster accumulation of blood mtDNA mutations have greater cognitive decline and preclinical ADRD brain imaging changes during midlife, and that these mtDNA biomarkers will predict ADRD diagnosis in older adults. We will test our hypotheses by leveraging the NHLBI-funded Coronary Artery Risk Development In young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a multicenter, community-based, longitudinal cohort that recruited 5,115 black and white young adults (mean age 25 years), followed them up at least every five years, and is preparing to conduct its examination Year 35 (Y35) visit in 2020/21 (mean age 60 years) when over 3,000 participants are expected to return. We will use state-of-the-art deep sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutations in CARDIA blood samples collected at Y15, Y25, and Y35. In Aim 1, we will determine whether higher levels of mtDNA mutations and their accumulation over time are associated with greater cognitive decline in midlife. In Aim 2, we will determine whether mtDNA mutations are associated with structural, physiological, and functional MRI phenotypes of preclinical ADRD as well as with sensitive MRI-based markers of accelerated brain aging and preclinical ADRD constructed by our team using contemporary machine learning techniques. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the clinical utility of these mtDNA mutation biomarkers in identifying individuals at risk of future ADRD in four older cohorts that have large numbers of longitudinally identified, clinically-diagnosed ADRD. Our focus on longitudinal measures of blood mtDNA, cognitive function, and MRI changes over a 10- year period during midlife, combined with characterization of their clinical utility in older populations, is highly innovative. If successful, our study may help initiate possible future interventions in early midlife and reduce the public health and medical burden of AD and dementia. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This study has high potential for characterizing novel blood-based biomarkers to identify preclinical ADRD and test their utility in predicting clinical ADRD. No other study has a similar design with repeated blood mtDNA mutations, cognitive assessments, and brain imaging data during midlife, a critical time window for interventions to prevent clinical ADRD development. By also using data from four large cohorts of older adults, we can determine the clinical utility of these mtDNA biomarkers to predict clinical ADRD and move the field closer toward the NIH’s goal of personalized health interventions.",Blood mitochondrial DNA biomarkers of midlife cognitive decline and adverse brain imaging changes - A longitudinal investigation in the CARDIA population‐based cohort study,10216953,R01AG069120,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mutation', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nuclear', 'Older Population', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep sequencing', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome sequencing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'mitochondrial DNA mutation', 'mitochondrial genome', 'novel', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'tissue injury', 'tool', 'whole genome', 'young adult']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,796409,558628098
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics. We will work closely with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC) on assay development, testing, and validation for submission to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and timely deployment of these assays for clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Novel approaches to accurately diagnose acute pediatric COVID-19 associated diseases, including the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), as well as predict clinical severity and outcomes, are urgently needed. For this project, we will identify RNA transcriptomic and cell-free DNA omics biomarkers that will be used to develop and validate host-based assays from nasal swab and blood samples, with the goal of regulatory submission for FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).",Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19,10273964,R61HD105618,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'BLase', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 assay', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'California', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'FDA Emergency Use Authorization', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'RADx', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'cell free DNA', 'clinical assay development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'genetic pedigree', 'nasal swab', 'novel strategies', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'research clinical testing', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R61,2021,863810,685608202
"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),10273778,R61HD105613,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensor', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cardiac', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colombia', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mind', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Native Americans', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'RADx', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'Youth', 'acute infection', 'arm', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biosignature', 'care outcomes', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fight against', 'gut-brain axis', 'instrument', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'pediatric patients', 'plasmonics', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2021,877921,488339
"Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis ABSTRACT Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by non-caseating granulomas in affected organs, primarily in the lungs. Approximately 30% of patients with sarcoidosis progress to debilitating disease; however, the drivers of susceptibility or resilience to disease remain poorly understood. An inflammatory response to an undefined antigen is postulated as the etiology of granuloma formation, and the pathogenesis has been suggested to involve gene-pathogen interaction, yet analysis of single genes or microbes has not proven applicable to diagnosis of all forms of sarcoidosis. Indeed, rather than a single organism, the disease may represent an interaction between the community of organisms that comprise the lung microbiome (community of organisms that live in and on us) and the host immune response. We propose that understanding the microbiome/host interaction will suggest strategies for precision medicine approaches to sarcoidosis. This proposal addresses this significant gap by investigating interactions between the lung microbiome, host immune and clinical responses in sarcoidosis using multiomics approaches – a critically innovative strategy. Our preliminary data support our novel hypotheses. First, we identified distinct lung microbiomes that differentiated patients with sarcoidosis versus controls. Second, our results identified biomarkers of disease severity that were associated with decreased lung function. Third, a recurrent analytic theme that emerged, regardless of the type of -omic analysis, was that sarcoidosis is characterized by pathways related to apoptosis and autophagy, which is consistent with our observation of decreased abundance of peripheral lymphocytes and functional immune anergy. These data led us to our Overall Hypothesis: Lung microbiome and host immune interactions characterized by apoptosis and autophagy pathways influence sarcoidosis clinical course. This hypothesis will be tested by an observational prospective and validation study of sarcoidosis patients at 5 time points to facilitate time series analyses. Aims 1 and 2 focus on lung microbiome or host immune responses, respectively, in relation to clinical course of sarcoidosis. Using these data in Aim 3, predictive models will be constructed based on integrated data of metagenomic and host-immune interactions. The novelty and significance of our multiomics strategy is to construct models for precision medicine therapies to harness bioinformatic strategies into focused, patient-specific approaches. The long-term significance of this study is to define pathways for sarcoidosis progression or resolution, and to develop database of these findings to further develop more precise, testable, models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that predominately affects the lung and may affect other organs. We propose to construct a model to predict sarcoidosis progression or resolution by identifying microbial and immune interactions. We postulate that these models will be helpful in designing therapeutic options.",Precision Medicine in Sarcoidosis,10087953,R01HL138628,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Genes', 'Granuloma', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lung', 'Lymphocyte', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Sarcoidosis', 'Severity of illness', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'anergy', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'host microbiome', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'lung microbiome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'resilience', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,912947,148463823
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775,641965656
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830,593605914
"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730,560644462
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'dieting', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872,415711940
"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'European', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guide prevention', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep-focused interventions', 'sociodemographic factors', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,1968065,570146095
"Fluomics: The Next Generation Influenza A virus is a major human respiratory pathogen, and available vaccines and antivirals are of limited efficacy. In order to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention during influenza virus infection, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team that uses a highly integrated systems level approach to identify and validate key genes/networks involved in virus pathogenesis. The overarching theme of our multidisciplinary proposal “FluOMICS: The NEXT Generation” is to obtain multiple OMICS-based systems level measurements and integrate them using modeling approaches and machine learning algorithms to identify and validate 1) host-virus networks that modulate influenza A virus disease severity, 2) biomarkers in blood that reflect the activation states of these networks and 3) novel host targets for therapeutic interventions. Our underlying main hypothesis is that host networks involved in viral replication and early host responses regulate disease outcomes and represent targets for therapeutic intervention. The proposed studies leverage on our previous collaborations that generated global datasets and models that predict severity of disease caused by three influenza virus strains with different levels of virulence. While our previous studies gave many novel insights in influenza pathogenesis, they likely provide a narrow window on the determinants of disease severity in humans. Thus, it is necessary expand beyond the specific virus strains that were used to study pathogenesis, and explore a broader context of viral and host perturbations linked to clinical outcomes. In order to identify clinically relevant networks involved in influenza virus pathogenesis we propose to integrate into predictive and comprehensive models global responses during influenza virus infection in three systems 1) human blood from a human cohort of patients with documented influenza virus infection and diverse clinical outcomes (Project 1); 2) mouse blood and tissues from experimentally infected animals under a variety of conditions and perturbations resulting in diverse disease outcomes (Project 1) and 3) relevant primary human cells (Project 2). Samples will be processed and send to the Technology Core for global transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics analysis. OMICS data sets will be integrated and compared by the Modeling Core to generate network models of disease, uncover blood biomarkers and identify key drivers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Predicted network regulators will be used as a source for subsequent iterative rounds of perturbations to refine existing and to identify new network disease models. Data and models will be managed and disseminated by the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core. We expect that these studies will uncover and validate novel pathogenic networks, blood biomarkers associated with them, and specific therapeutic targets to revert pathogenic networks. In summary, our modeling approaches will find correlates and associations between diverse experimental systems that will help us define human blood biomarkers, and link them to in vivo and ex vivo signatures for both companion diagnostics and personalized therapies. We propose a systematic approach (FluOMICS) to generate predictive models of influenza virus pathogenesis which will a) allow us to identify biomarkers for predicting disease outcome, and b) provide avenues to explore for new, host-directed, therapeutic interventions.",Fluomics: The Next Generation,10080700,U19AI135972,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Pathogenesis', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'data integration', 'data management', 'early detection biomarkers', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'human pathogen', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus strain', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'lipidomics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'resilience', 'respiratory pathogen', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,2648626,415711940
