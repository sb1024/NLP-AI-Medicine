"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,10058252,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,38571,560644462
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243,2966077
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556,4738513
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10159875,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'refractory cancer', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2021,153920,61807989
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,10112301,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2021,162792,367414121
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Mapping Single Extracellular Vesicles to Parent Cells for Immunotherapy Monitoring This proposal aims to develop an ultra-high sensitive platform that can map cell and extracellular vesicle (EV) molecular information at the single particle level, and apply it to proﬁle tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for immunotherapy monitoring. This technology can resolve heterogeneity of biological systems and has the potential to discover robust biomarkers that can accurately proﬁle status of the body for disease diagnostics. This proposal hypothesizes that single cell-single EV mapping will provide new molecular information on cell-cell communication for better understanding of pathological development and disease diagnosis. The goals of this proposal are threefold: i) development of single EV protein sequencing technology to resolve EV heterogeneity and discover rare EV subtypes for disease biomarkers, ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed live cell ﬂuorescence imaging to monitor the changes of cellular phenotypes and identify multiple immune cell types, and iii) single cell-single EV mapping to discover new molecular information on cell-cell communication through vesicle secretion. This technology will allow repeat sampling and monitoring of TIME during the course of immunotherapy and provide guidance to achieve the best possible patient outcomes. With the expertise in microﬂuidics, molecular biology, and machine learning, Jina Ko (the PI of this proposal) has developed new micro- and nano-technologies for liquid biopsy that can extract multidimensional molecular data from blood-based biomarkers (e.g. circulating tumor cells, EV). She has extended her expertise to chemistry, droplet microﬂuidics, and translational medicine to develop novel platforms that will serve as a fundamental work to this proposal. She has recently developed i) ultra-high sensitive single EV proﬁling technology using droplet digital PCR and ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed cellular ﬂuorescence imaging. Through this work, Jina has forged research collaborations within and outside the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School at the Wyss Institute and Harvard University. Building upon these achievements, this work will be executed with a team of world experts in droplet microﬂuidics and physics (Weitz), molecular imaging and diagnostics (Weissleder), immunology (Pittet), exosome biology and neurogenetics (Breakeﬁeld), and neurosurgery and oncology (Chiocca) who will provide a full support on this work. Working with these mentors will allow her to tackle clinically challenging problems and further develop her career as an independent investigator with the ability to develop next generation medical diagnostics. The aim of this proposal is to develop an ultra-high sensitive single cell-single extracellular vesicle (EV) mapping technology that can resolve both cell and EV heterogeneity.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. As an application of this platform, we propose to measure the forces stem- cell derived cardiomyocytes which bear genetically encoded contractile dysfunction for drug screening.",Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets,10158533,R21GM137151,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boron', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Individual', 'Island', 'Kinetics', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Myopathy', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Relaxation', 'Role', 'Sarcomeres', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'analog', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cellular engineering', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'detection limit', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'metallicity', 'nano', 'nanofabrication', 'response', 'sensor', 'stem cells', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2021,182532,524978793

"Role of Epigenetically Active Environmental Compounds in Neurodevelopmental Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), are increasingly recognized as originating from dysregulation of early brain development, which represents a window of vulnerability to environmental compounds. Environmental compounds may alter neurodevelopment via epigenetic mechanisms, which may not induce massive cell death, but change the brain function through their epigenetic effect on stem cell fate and lineage development. However, tools to systematically examine the epigenetic impact of environment on neurodevelopment are lacking. Here we employ Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL) to screen ToxCast e1k chemical library (1800 compounds) and to characterize hits that alter epigenetic landscape of human neural precursors without inducing cytotoxicity. Recognizing environmental insults and understanding their mechanism of action will enable the development of regulations and guidelines aimed at avoiding such insults and the development of antidotes and protective agents when exposure is unavoidable. PROJECT NARRATIVE We developed a novel technique rooted in analysis of the epigenome topography at the single-cell level.

"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury.

"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points. Our study aims to combine state-of-the art advances in microfluidics, computer vision, laboratory automation and a massively curated genetically diverse nematode species to produce a new screening approach capable of testing thousands of chemicals relevant to agriculture, nutraceutical and biotech markets.",A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations,10112054,R43ES032516,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Agriculture', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Automation', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Cadmium', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Food Additives', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Hazard Assessment', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Infrastructure', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Liquid substance', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metformin', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nematoda', 'Nutraceutical', 'Paraquat', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Safety', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug candidate', 'genetic resource', 'genetic strain', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo Model', 'neuromuscular', 'new technology', 'reproductive', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'technology development']",NIEHS,NEMALIFE INC.,R43,2021,251040,0
"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580,1815440
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,R21AI151491,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691,558628098
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844,641965656
"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,10160919,R01GM127985,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Biomass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Giant Cells', 'Goals', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Interferometry', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'Western World', 'biological systems', 'biophysical properties', 'body system', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'desmoplakin', 'electrical measurement', 'electrical property', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'regenerative', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,379224,673201228
"Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with high- risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, HSCT is affected by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft- versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, both are mediated by donor T lymphocytes and significantly impact treatment success and thus overall outcome. AML patients commonly harbor FLT3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that is associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 targeted therapies have proven clinical benefit particularly when used in combinational approaches. Midostaurin (a kinase inhibitor) was recently approved for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition to their direct leukemia suppressive effects, FLT3 inhibitors activate leukemia antigen-specific T-cell responses. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that recognize antigens presented by MHC molecules. We recently characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or haplo-cord HSCT. We demonstrated that GvHD and relapse (exclusive of each other) are associated with lower TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our data suggest that individual variations in the immune repertoire significantly impact the clinical outcome in AML patients and underscore the need for comprehensive quantitative, functional, and mechanistic analyses of the TCR repertoire in a large cohort of AML patients. Here, we hypothesize: 1) TCR repertoire (diversity, clonal expansion, and V-segment utilization) affects clinical outcome (GvHD or relapse) and can therefore be used to identify GvL- and GvHD- associated clones; 2) Somatic mutations in leukemic cells (e.g., FLT3-ITD) affect the TCR repertoire and subsequent expansion of specific T-cell clones; and 3) FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin) modulate the TCR repertoire and function and enhance GvL effects in patients undergoing HSCT. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study characterizing the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape of leukemia cells in ~250 patients (~ 60–80 with FLT3-ITD). GvHD or relapse will be predicted using a proportional hazards model for competing risks based on TCR repertoire characteristics. TCR sequences and somatic mutations will be analyzed using a structure based prediction algorithms we developed to predict candidate leukemia neoantigens and associated TCR clones. Neoantigens will be validated using in vitro and murine models. Finally, functional analyses will examine the effect of midostaurin on TCR repertoire and function. Our findings will establish the TCR repertoire as a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes of HSCT and identify responsible TCR clones. The identification of TCR clones associated with the GvL effect against FLT3-ITD+ cells will facilitate the development of engineered T cells expressing GvL-associated TCR clones. Modifying the TCR repertoire composition via therapies targeting specific somatic mutations will facilitate development of optimized combinational therapeutic approaches, such as the addition of targeted therapy to post-transplant regimens. Narrative: Sparing normal cells while killing leukemic cells (harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia effect) by manipulating alloreactive T cells remains challenging in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative approach for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this proposed research, we leverage genomic and immunogenomic data obtained from patients undergoing HSCT to identify leukemia- specific neoantigens for preclinical investigation as potential therapeutic targets. The knowledge resulting from this proposed research will advance the development of personalized treatments for AML patients.",Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia,10120569,R01CA248381,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Antigens', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease remission', 'FDA approved', 'FLT3 gene', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immune', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective cohort study', 'RNA', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxic', 'disorder risk', 'engineered T cells', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'graft vs host disease', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'high risk', 'individual variation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge of results', 'leukemia', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'post-transplant', 'pre-clinical', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'relapse risk', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,379419,324592664
"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.

"Validation of an in vitro model of progressive fibrosis that mimics Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press). To make our progressive fibrosis model specific to IPF, we have developed it into a model system that utilizes the lung 3D architecture and specific cell types. Our 3D model displays additional features of IPF such as airway epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and replacement of alveolar architecture. Our proposal aims to improve and validate this 3D model such that it will be amenable to a high throughput drug discovery platform in a patient specific manner for precision medicine.

"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330,570146095
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis.

"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,621465,86807134
"Integrative single cell analyses of inflammation-derived circulating hybrid cells to identify aggressive disease PROJECT SUMMARY The lifetime risk for acquiring colorectal cancer (CRC) is 7%, with an astounding rate of disease recurrence in 32% of newly diagnosed patients after their “successful” treatment. Patient with recurrent disease have a dismal 14.3% five-year survival. Lack of effective biomarkers hampers early detection of pre-metastatic disease, impacting overall survival from CRC. We identified a promising disseminated tumor cell—a product of macrophage (MФ) and cancer cell fusion—that harbors genotypic and phenotypic features of both cells of origin. Detectable along the metastatic cascade, hybrid cells can initiate tumor growth, migrate in response to MФ receptor-ligand chemotaxis, and seed metastatic sites. In peripheral blood, hybrids, named circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CRC patients, overcoming the sensitivity of CTC—a primary barrier—to usage as a biomarker for disease. CHCs are phenotypically diverse and reflect protein expression of the primary tumor. Based on these exciting findings, we propose that hybrid cells subpopulations harbor discrete phenotypes of pre-metastatic cells that can be identified and defined using single cell image-based phenotyping through multiplexed imaging and multimodal integration with –omics. To this end, we will analyze CHCs derived from early stage and metastatic tumors for image-based phenotyping with single cell gene expression. Utilizing quantitative and advanced image analytics including deep learning approach for image-based cell profiling, we will define inter/subcellular spatial features in single cells to identify new subpopulations and differentiate discrete phenotypic populations associated with metastatic signatures. In addition, the application of both imaging and genomic technologies to the same specimen independently measures highly dimensional, yet non-orthogonal, sets of cellular features. Multimodal integration of imaging and single cell data will quantify systems-level biological functions of cellular subpopulation and enhance imaging biomarker panel to gain biomarker specificity and sensitivity for validation in a discrete CRC patient cohort. Our overall goal is to develop a novel tumor biomarker, based upon CHC phenotyping and –omics analyses that can be used to provide new quantitative insights and develop machine-driven prediction with superior accuracy for identifying risk of metastases in CRC patients to ultimately impact survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite advances in screening, colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death due to a high recurrence rate after initial treatment and a dismal 14.3% survival rate of patients with recurrent disease. Improving survival from colorectal cancer requires the ability to develop effective biomarkers for early detection of recurrent/pre-metastatic disease.

"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant. Understanding what stimulates these behaviors will help research scientists and physicians to make bone marrow transplants more successful at curing cancer.",Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes,10101252,R01HL155741,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allogenic', 'Allografting', 'Antitumor Response', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Donor Selection', 'Education', 'Failure', 'Gene Combinations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologist', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'NK cell receptor NKB1', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptide Leader Sequences', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Receptor Gene', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Models', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'dimorphism', 'disorder risk', 'graft vs host disease', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'peptide B', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relapse prediction', 'response']",NHLBI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,650223,185946435
"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.
