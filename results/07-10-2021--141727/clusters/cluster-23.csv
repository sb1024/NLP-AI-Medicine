"Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia Project Summary  HIV testing jumpstarts entry into the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. HIV testing levels, however, are especially low in men who have sex with men (MSM), who increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM in Malaysia has soared to 21.6% nationally, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that ever tested is 70.3%, past- year tested is 40.9%, and only 9.5% were tested more than 1 time per year, despite extraordinary levels of self- reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in Malaysia are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given that there are many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using social-networking apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) may overcome such limitations, but has yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test an AI-chatbot (R21 phase). Findings from the R21 phase will inform a Type 1 Hybrid Implementation Science trial (R33 phase) to evaluate the efficacy and implementation outcomes of the AI-chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that using artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (My). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (named MyTestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create an mHealth intervention to provide MSM with real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. MyTestBot will provide culturally tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain.",Developing an artificial intelligence-based mHealth intervention to increase HIV testing in Malaysia,10064898,R21TW011663,"['AIDS prevention', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemic', 'Facebook', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysian', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Peru', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Same-sex', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexual Transmission', 'Social Network', 'South Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'computer program', 'cost', 'criminal behavior', 'design', 'experience', 'health management', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk men', 'humiliation', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'next generation', 'overtreatment', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'response', 'same sex behavior', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social stigma', 'sodomy', 'stem', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'treatment as usual', 'web site']",FIC,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,100000,550947887,0.3427923397053342
"The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cities account for a large proportion of the global population of people living with HIV. As a result, Cities have become the focus of UNAIDS's “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic through targeted scale-up of prevention and testing services. In the United States, HIV surveillance data indicates a shifting composition of the population of people newly infected with HIV, with females and minority populations accounting for disproportionate rates of infection. These emerging health disparities in HIV incidence suggest that the largely successful “Getting to Zero” public health initiatives (e.g. rapid expansion of pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], needle exchange and safe injecting sites, etc.) are not reaching the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging routinely collected surveillance data paired with primary data collection, the major goal of this research is to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection in Fast Track cities, using San Francisco as a test case. This proposal seeks to provide multidisciplinary methodological and theoretical training to investigate the scientific knowledge gap of ongoing HIV transmission in the era of “Getting to Zero.” The proposed training areas are: (1) semi-parametric statistical modeling and machine learning in order to improve the accuracy and precision of population size estimation methods; (2) molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic techniques to assess the relatedness of HIV viral sequences between individuals, inferring a shared source of infection; and (3) minority stress theory to measure the (socio-structural) characteristics of the environment and relate these structural exposures to disparities in HIV infection. Aligned with the training components, the research goals of this study are to: (a) estimate how many people are living with HIV in San Francisco and quantify the magnitude of disparities in infection rates and access to health care services; (b) identify the sociodemographic correlates of membership to a transmission cluster; and (c) identify the socio-structural facilitators of recent HIV infections, particularly among minority populations, using a case-control study design. The evidence generated from this work could have a direct impact on San Francisco's Getting to Zero campaign and inform novel intervention targets for other Fast Track cities. Additionally, the exceptional methodological and practical experience gained from this project will position the candidate for an impactful career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cities account for a large proportion of HIV prevalence and incidence, and therefore are the focus of UNAIDS' “Fast Track” approach to ending the AIDS epidemic. Several “Fast Track Cities”, including San Francisco, CA, have achieved significant reductions in new HIV infections, and yet despite this success racial/ethnic and gender disparities in new infections are emerging. The proposed study will use semi-parametric statistical modeling and HIV phylogenetics applied to routinely collected public health surveillance data, paired with primary data collection informed by a minority stress theoretical framework, to identify the residual drivers of HIV infection and offer novel targets for intervention to achieve zero new infections.",The science for the last mile: Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance to accelerate HIV elimination,9926504,K01AI145572,"['Accounting', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'African American', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease model', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Antibodies', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infection', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Needle Sharing', 'Needle-Exchange Programs', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sizes', 'Population Surveillance', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universal Coverage', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'diverse data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender disparity', 'health care availability', 'health care service', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'housing instability', 'improved', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevention service', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'scale up', 'semiparametric', 'sex', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social epidemiology', 'social stigma', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'success', 'surveillance data', 'testing services', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2020,135824,685608202,0.29695897471027827
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9851871,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2020,165510,168440418,0.13964562602897596
"Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a training and research program that will enable the Candidate to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator with expertise in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) and maternal and child health.    The Candidate is an Infectious Disease physician trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, with experience in evaluating TB diagnostics, and implementation and evaluation of HIV and TB screening algorithms. For this K23 award, the career development plan will provide the Candidate with mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage influence latent tuberculosis (LTBI) infection test discordance.     HIV-infected individuals and infants have an increased risk of progression from Mtb infection to TB disease. Pregnant and postpartum periods have also been associated with increased risk of TB. Whether maternal HIV increases susceptibility to Mtb infection among peripartum women and their infants, and the dual roles of HIV and peripartum stage on latent TB testing are unknown.     The investigator proposes to develop new parallel prospective cohorts enrolling HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Research Specific Aims are to determine the: (Aim 1) effect of maternal HIV on risk and timing of maternal peripartum Mtb infection, (Aim 2) influence of maternal HIV on risk of infant Mtb infection, and (Aim 3) effect of maternal HIV status and peripartum stage on LTBI test performance, including interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). The incidence of maternal Mtb infection will be estimated and compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women using IGRA in pregnancy, and at 6 weeks, and 1 year postpartum. The prevalence of Mtb infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants will be compared at 6 and 12 months of age by IGRA. TST and IGRA discordance will be compared in pregnancy, early postpartum, and late postpartum within each maternal cohort and between HIV-infected and uninfected women. Potential cofactors for maternal and infant Mtb infection and maternal LTBI test discordance will be evaluated.     The Candidate proposes training designed to provide her skills in implementing prospective cohort studies and conducting complex longitudinal data analysis in maternal-infant cohorts as part of her research proposal, as well as in interventional trial design, cost-effectiveness and outcomes modeling to provide a foundation for future directions including submitting an R01 proposal. Skills will be gained through directed mentorship, didactic coursework, the proposed research plan, as well as additional mentor-identified opportunities to collaborate on international HIV/TB trials.     Her specific goals over the training period are to 1) gain proficiency in advanced logistic regression and linear mixed models, 2) develop content expertise in key areas of HIV/TB-related research in maternal child health settings, 3) lead a longitudinal epidemiologic study, 4) contribute to understanding epidemiologic correlates of Mtb infection in HIV-infected mothers and their children, 5) build a foundation in cost-effectiveness modeling including the use of composite risk-benefit maternal-infant outcomes, and 6) generate original data and scientific questions while expanding her publication record in order to successfully compete for independent funding at the R01 level. The Candidate has identified an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. John-Stewart, Gupta, Kinuthia, Richardson) and collaborators (Drs. Horne, Maleche-Obimbo, Cain, Levin) from University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nairobi, and CDC with expertise in HIV and TB epidemiology in women and children, longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, TB diagnostics, cost-effectiveness and infectious disease modeling. The Candidate's institution has a long-standing history of collaborative research in Kenya. Her mentors and institution have committed the resources needed to successfully advance her research independence.     The research findings will provide important data regarding TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and inform future TB interventional trials and models in the context of maternal/child health. This proposed project will provide the groundwork for the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden through evidence- based preventive strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sylvia LaCourse, MD, MPH, is an Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington. For this K23 award, the proposed career development plan and clinical research will allow the Candidate mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage are associated with latent tuberculosis infection test discordance. The research findings will provide important data regarding Mtb infection and TB epidemiology and pathogenesis in high HIV prevalence settings and inform future interventional trials and cost-effectiveness models to evaluate TB screening and preventive therapy approaches in the context of maternal/child health that will form the basis of the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden.",Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants,9884715,K23AI120793,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Household', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type II', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health economics', 'health seeking behavior', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'infection risk', 'infectious disease model', 'instructor', 'intervention cost', 'isoniazid', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'trial design', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,184588,533302350,0.036995824753456814
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9873904,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'perinatal HIV', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2020,188938,327644200,0.3527569620524907
"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health",9995041,K08MH118094,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amphetamines', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'dual diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'mental health epidemiology', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'personalized management', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychiatric symptom', 'racial diversity', 'research and development', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,198210,807432003,0.2083514448320323
"UTILIZING TWITTER TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT YOUNG BLACK MEN AT HIGH RISK OF HIV INFECTION Project Summary  The disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black men underscores a dire need for technologically innovative and culturally-responsive approaches to reduce HIV in Black communities. There is evidence that social media platforms such as Twitter may offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify and recruit young Black men (YBM) at elevated risk, but to date there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support that social media based-recruitment using natural language processing is feasible and/or acceptable. On social media platforms like Twitter, young men share substance and sex related content. We propose mining these Twitter posts to identify YBM who may be at risk of elevated HIV, based on their substance and sexual risk posts. This study will serve as a proof of method to test the extent to which we can identify and recruit YBM based on their social media posts. We will extend and calibrate our “High-Risk Language” (HRL) algorithm to identify users who post HIV-risk related language on Twitter. Those who agree to participate and deemed eligible will complete a qualitative interview and in- person study visit which includes HIV testing, multi-drug screening, and a survey of their sexual risk and substance use behaviors. Our primary outcomes are; (1) condomless (and/or without PrEP) vaginal or anal sex and (2) illicit drug use before or during sex. We will assess the yield and accuracy of our HRL algorithm at identifying YBM at risk, compared to their biomarkers and surveys. This work will test cutting-edge research tools aimed at increasing the rigor and precision of online recruitment efforts to reduce HIV in the Black community. Project Narrative HIV prevention and care strategies require a synergistic approach to fight HIV in the Black community. The proposed project aims to test an innovative identification and recruitment method using social media to target young black men at elevated risk for HIV infection.",UTILIZING TWITTER TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT YOUNG BLACK MEN AT HIGH RISK OF HIV INFECTION,10214087,R21DA049572,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anal Sex', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Drug Screening', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Prevention', 'Privatization', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Social support', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Twitter', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cisgender', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'eligible participant', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'illicit drug use', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevention service', 'primary outcome', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'residence', 'screening', 'sex', 'sexual minority', 'social media', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'web site', 'young adult', 'young man']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2020,247500,324592664,0.2770102441843489
"Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Title Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing Abstract (30 Lines)  HIV testing jumpstarts the HIV prevention and treatment care continuum. HIV testing levels in men who have sex with men (MSM) and in diverse settings like Malaysia are especially low. MSM increasingly contribute to heightened HIV transmission in the presence of high levels of stigma and discrimination. For high risk MSM, new guidelines recommend frequent HIV testing, ranging from every 3 to 6 months. Yet, HIV testing in MSM often occurs less frequently due to individual (e.g., heightened concerns about risk disclosure), clinic (e.g., confidentiality breaches, and discrimination from healthcare providers) and policy (criminalization of same-sex sexual behaviors) barriers. HIV prevalence in MSM has soared to 21.6% in Malaysia, exceeding 40.9% in Kuala Lumpur. While surveillance surveys of MSM in Malaysia who meet criteria for PrEP suggest that lifetime HIV testing is 70.3%, past-year testing is 40.9% and only 9.5% were tested more than once-yearly despite extraordinary levels of self-reported risk. Once tested, however, MSM with HIV in Malaysia are likely to be treated with ART and achieve viral suppression, making HIV testing a central focus for HIV prevention and treatment.  Innovative strategies that motivate and provide guidance for testing among MSM in these settings are therefore urgently needed. Intervening using Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IBM) model of behavioral change is ideally suited to overcome barriers to recommended HIV testing in MSM. Moreover, in settings like Malaysia where the HIV epidemic has transitioned from primarily concentrated in PWID to a volatile epidemic in MSM, theory-guided behavioral change strategies that inform, motivate and provide pragmatic skills to more fully engage in recommended HIV testing are poised to accelerate the HIV prevention and care continuum. Given the many individual, clinic and policy barriers to HIV testing, mobile health (mHealth) interventions that reduce “in person” contact and offer a menu of behavioral skills is ideally suited to increase access to MSM in highly stigmatized settings and promote recommended HIV testing. Recent studies in the U.S., China, South Africa, and Peru show that mHealth interventions using smartphones and apps have the potential to increase HIV testing while maintaining MSM’s confidentiality and providing real-time information, motivation and behavioral skills to overcome barriers. Such mHealth interventions are feasible and acceptable among MSM, including in Malaysia where most MSM find sexual partners using smartphone apps with similar interfaces and functionalities to the proposed intervention. Current mHealth strategies, however, are limited by their lack of automation and need for high-intensity and sustained human inputs, which restricts their scale-up. Artificial intelligence using machine learning (AI/ML) may overcome such limitations, but have yet to be applied to mHealth-based HIV testing algorithms. We therefore aim to develop and pilot test to assess acceptability and feasibility of an AI/ML-Chatbot for HIV testing relative to treatment as usual (control). Findings from this exploratory pilot study will inform a future prospective Type 1 Hybrid implementation science trial. Project Narrative The proposed research will focus on developing a chatbot that adapts using machine learning and artificial intelligence to promote HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM). Once developed and adequately tested, the new chatbot (TestBot) will be embedded into a social networking app selected by MSM to create a mHealth intervention for MSM to promote real-time HIV testing-related information, motivation, and behavioral skills. TestBot will provide culturally-tailored messages to promote HIV testing in MSM that does not rely on intensive human resources to develop and maintain the intervention.",Developing an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot to Promote HIV Testing,10082768,R21AI152927,"['AIDS prevention', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'China', 'Clinic', 'Community Networks', 'Computer Systems', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Epidemic', 'Facebook', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hybrids', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaysia', 'Malaysian', 'Manuals', 'Massage', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Names', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Peru', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Same-sex', 'Sauna', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexual Transmission', 'Social Network', 'South Africa', 'Stigmatization', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'criminal behavior', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'health management', 'high risk men', 'humiliation', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'model building', 'next generation', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prospective', 'response', 'same sex behavior', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'social stigma', 'sodomy', 'tailored messaging', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'treatment as usual', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,248218,550947887,0.3362894730337681
"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,10253483,R00HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R00,2020,248752,324592664,0.17297123616379229
"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP. This research will lay essential groundwork for a full-scale study to test whether integrating automated tools into electronic health records to help providers identify potential candidates for PrEP can improve PrEP prescribing and prevent new HIV infections in community health centers.",EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers,9926611,R34MH122291,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Anatomy', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Community Health Networks', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Priorities', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Latino', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Underinsured', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'anal pap smear', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'demographics', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'risk prediction model', 'routine care', 'safety net', 'scale up', 'side effect', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIMH,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R34,2020,280307,14964406,0.20081475030330884
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment. Capitalizing on existing datasets, this project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments in active drug users.",MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications,9848523,R01DA045565,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'cocaine use', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'connectome data', 'daily functioning', 'data fusion', 'data harmonization', 'data quality', 'denoising', 'executive function', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non-drug', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention service', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'service delivery', 'sound', 'stimulant use', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387535,607172798,0.2914062218494129
"Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche Abstract Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced KS-associated mortality among AIDS patients; however, a serous clinical problem exists in that up to 50% of HIV+KS+ patients in the United States and 61% in Sub-Saharan Africa never achieve complete remission even with chemotherapy and a reduction in HIV viral loads. No definitive study has identified if there are tumor-associated features or mechanisms are associated with cART-progressive KS (progressors) vs. the responder (responders) phenotype. Our study utilizes a robust pre-cART KS tissue collection (n = 224) from the ACSR that originated from the Antiretrovirals for Kaposi's Sarcoma (ARKS) clinical trial. 36% of ARKS participants experienced continued progression of KS despite a reduction in viral loads and restored T-cell counts, in contrast to the rest of the cohort who experienced a reduction or elimination of tumors by the 1-year trial endpoint. This application poses several hypotheses concerning the progressor phenotype: 1) prior to the initiation of cART, an increase in HIV and/or KSHV-infected immune cells enhances a stimulatory immunological profile in the progressor phenotype, 2) there are significant differences in the upregulation of KSHV lytic and immunomodulation genes, which stimulate increased immune cell recruitment into the pre-cART tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression through cytokine-signaling inflammatory processes enhanced in part by the cART-revitalized immune system, 3) the highly inflammatory nature of KS tumors, comprising a complex mixture of immune cells with which to interact, selects for unique and/or elusive HIV genotypes, distinct from plasma HIV, that promote stimulatory processes to continue in the progressor phenotype. Our Specific Aims address these hypotheses using a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry, virus specific cellular localization (DNA and RNAscope), high-throughput gene expression analysis (RNAseq), and a novel deep sequencing approach applied to HIV. Innovations include the unprecedented amount pre-cART KS tumor material available for the study, advanced imagining technologies, in vivo KS tumors gene expression studies, the use of the newer PacBio SMRT sequencing approach applied to HIV, and machine-learning approaches that can define non-linear associations in complex data sets. This project will define the largest well-characterized set of combinatorial features related to cART-associated KS outcomes derived directly from KS-associated biomaterial. Identifying clinically relevant immune factors in the tumor niche pre-cART will pave the way for the development of future mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in cART resistant tumor progression. Project Narrative Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) successfully reduces the risk of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in the majority of HIV infected people; however, up to 50% of those treated will never retrieve remission, even when viral loads are reduced and the immune system is restored. In this project we will to determine the pre-cART tumor features that identify the progressor phenotype. With the ability to differentiate between the progressor and responder outcome categories, a simple biopsy prior to cART could elucidate a better combinatorial treatment approach.",Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche,10020368,R01CA239263,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bar Codes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'HIV', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 8', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Lytic Virus', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physical environment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serous', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Tropism', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'complex data ', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'single molecule real time sequencing', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,566972,685608202,0.15266398569162964
"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9944437,R01AI127203,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Big Data Methods', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'big-data science', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'data mining', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'surveillance data', 'survival outcome', 'transmission process', 'treatment research']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,589629,45219910,0.38163612975832617
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9928910,R01DA047820,"['Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Association Learning', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Methylation', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Veterans', 'Women’s Interagency HIV Study', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cocaine use', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'feature selection', 'frailty', 'immune function', 'machine learning method', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'painful neuropathy', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'substance misuse', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,595425,550947887,0.2545946997080073
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1.

"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis",9982762,R01AI143453,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asia', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cryptococcal Meningitis', 'Cryptococcosis', 'Cryptococcus', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Encapsulated', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glucans', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Meningitis', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morphology', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Solid', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'beta-Glucans', 'differential expression', 'fungus', 'global health', 'glucuronoxylomannan', 'high risk', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immune reconstitution', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'insight', 'interest', 'laminaran', 'microbial', 'mind control', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'natural antibodies', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,667846,199779478,0.2154149629713311
"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9903280,R01DA047149,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cannabis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated cognitive impairment', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'addiction', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'drug of abuse', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neuroAIDS', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'sound', 'stem', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,679784,607172798,0.30394291684308666
"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9892947,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Analyses', 'Demographic and Health Surveys', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Program Efficiency', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cohort', 'health goals', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'testing services', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,691449,560644462,0.3593805792144436
"Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework SUMMARY Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy, the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention and intervention strategies designed to reduce significantly both prevalence and incidence worldwide. In order to achieve the 2020 UNAIDS 90-90-90 goal (90% of people living with HIV diagnosed, 90% of people diagnosed to be on sustained antiretroviral treatment, and 90% of people on treatment to maintain viral suppression), it is necessary to develop innovative tools that can be used for predicting the growth and trajectory of localized sub-epidemics driven by specific transmission clusters. Phylodynamic analysis has extensively been used in the HIV field to track the origin and reconstruct the virus demographic history both at local, regional and global level. However, such studies have been so far only retrospective, with little or no power to make predictions about future epidemic trends. The overarching goal of the prosed project is to develop an innovative computational framework coupling phylodynamic inference and behavioral network data with artificial intelligence algorithms capable of predicting HIV transmission clusters future trajectory, and informing on key determinants of new infections. We propose to achieve this goal by carrying out three specific aims: 1. Develop a phylodynamic-based PRIDE module to forecast HIV infection hotspots [the infected]; 2. Develop a behavioral network-based PRIDE module for risk of HIV infection [the uninfected], and 3. Carry out focus groups for deploying the new PRIDE forecasting technology into public health, and implement prevention through the peer change agent model. In particular, through a close partnership with the Florida Department of Health (FLDoH), we will analyze existing databases that the FLDoH has assembled over the past twelve years including extensive HIV molecular sequence, clinical and behavioral network data. Florida had an HIV case rate of 24.0 per 100,000 people in 2016, and it is currently the third state in the USA in terms of yearly incidence. Our partnership with the FLDoH will ensure that the results of the proposed research will be used to curtail the HIV epidemic by optimizing public health based surveillance programs, informing targeted intervention strategies, and implementing more effective prevention measures. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE / PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), the ongoing HIV epidemic still defies prevention strategies designed to reduce significantly incidence worldwide. Integrated statewide surveillance programs have been generating and linking big amasses of molecular, demographic, and clinical data. Advanced artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with molecular epidemiology tools can exploit these complex data to generate accurate predictions on epidemic spread that can be used to identify actionable sociodemographic factors guiding precision public health intervention.",Forecasting trajectories of HIV transmission networks with a novel phylodynamic and deep learning framework,9927071,R01AI145552,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation Reports', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Florida', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'complex data ', 'computer framework', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'working group']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,705136,188894159,0.26979759074469994
"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9903175,R01AI132030,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Engineering', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Facebook', 'HIV', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'software infrastructure', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,737082,167717872,0.319899262625575
"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring. PROJECT NARRATIVE    Methamphetamine (METH) is one of the most commonly abused drugs by persons at risk for or living with HIV  disease  and  both  METH  and  HIV  can  have  substantial  adverse  effects  on  the  brain  and  other  organs.  This  application  proposes  to  identify  METH-­  and  HIV-­associated  biomarker  signatures  of  central  nervous  system  (CNS) injury and resilience and to translate them to the clinical environment. The identification and validation of  biomarker  signature  profiles  for  detecting  METH-­  and  HIV-­related  CNS  outcomes  would  have  substantial  public health relevance and could support earlier diagnosis and intervention.    ",Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine,9963188,R01DA047879,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Albumins', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Feces', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Host Defense Mechanism', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methamphetamine dependence', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systemic disease', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'adverse outcome', 'assay development', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker validation', 'biosignature', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'central nervous system injury', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost efficient', 'drug development', 'drug of abuse', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'methamphetamine effect', 'methamphetamine use', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'resilience', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'stool sample', 'time use', 'tool']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,756747,524978793,0.30800697463944793
"Using big data and deep learning on predicting HIV transmission risk in MSM population Project Summary An important global public health priority is to develop new methods for identifying populations at greatest HIV risk, understanding HIV transmission network patterns, and intervening to reduce network risk. HIV testing is important to effect positive sexual behavior changes, and is an entry point to treatment, care, and psychosocial support. At the end of 2016, an estimated 1.1 million persons aged 13 and older were living with HIV infection in the United States, including an estimated 162,500 (14%) persons whose infections had not been diagnosed. In addition, many persons with HIV are tested late in the course of infection. Late testing results in missed opportunities for prevention and treatment of HIV, and increased risk for transmission to their partners. Current status – A number of epidemiological studies have employed social network theory/concepts and applied network analytical techniques to examine the structural characteristics of HIV transmission networks through phylogenetic link (HIV-1 pol sequences) and/or sexual/social/drug-using contacts among MSM. These studies, however, usually reduce the network information to summary information, consider only a subset of network variables, and/or use one layer of multi-dimension networks determining transmission paths such as only the social, sexual, contact, and venue perspectives. Challenges: The complexity of data that is important for HIV infection risk analysis makes it challenging to conduct risk and transmission prediction. More specifically, we are facing two challenges: (1) How to develop a mechanism to faithfully and flexibly represent the multi-dimensional network data collected from different sources at different time periods; (2) Once the data has been integrated, how to fully leverage the data to develop a risk prediction algorithm that considers the multi-dimensional networks with substantially interrelated factors in a comprehensive manner. Goals - We hypothesize that deep learning-based informatics approaches can provide a novel way for HIV infection risk prediction. In close collaboration with the public health department, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data. Using this dynamically collected data we will then develop practical deep-learning algorithms that leverage the comprehensive framework for cluster growth and identifying newly infected population. This proposal focuses specifically on ongoing epidemic growth among populations most at risk, including young men who have sex with men (MSM), which remain highly vulnerable to HIV in the U.S. Project Narrative A global public health priority is to develop new methods of understanding HIV transmission patterns, identifying and reaching community members at high risk for HIV infection, and intervening to reduce their infection risk. In close collaboration with the health departments of Houston and Chicago, we will construct a comprehensive framework that combines population-based molecular, behavior, and contact/partner tracing information including venue affiliation data and individual sex and drug-using behaviors, as well as existing locally collected cohort data.

"A Randomized Clinical Trial to Assess the Effectiveness of Ablative Treatments for Cervical-Cancer Risk Reduction in HIV+ Women living in Mozambique Invasive cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experience almost 90% of the global cervical-cancer burden, with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiencing the highest rates of cervical cancer. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which also disproportionately affects SSA, greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization now has a call-to-action for the elimination of cervical cancer, which includes vaccination young adolescents against human papillomavirus (HPV), the obligate viral cause of cervical cancer, and screening mid-adult women for the early detection and treatment of cervical abnormalities before becoming cancerous. However, both the best strategy for treating cervical abnormalities in women living with HIV (WLWH) from SSA and how to mitigate treatment failures are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we propose a randomized clinical trial to assess the treatment effectiveness of two ablative methods of treatment, gas-based cryotherapy and thermocoagulation, for treatment of CIN2/3 and high-risk HPV in WLWH women. Eligible, confirmed WLWH women (n=5,014), ages 25-49 years, and living in Maputo, Mozambique, in conjunction with the local PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief) program, will be recruited to participate in this trial when attending their routine HIV-care visit. Consenting WLWH will be screened by rapid, point-of-care hrHPV DNA testing, unaided visual inspection after acetic acid (VIA), and “deep learning”-derived, automated visual evaluation (AVE) algorithm applied to a digital image captured on a cell phone, thereby ensuring that most CIN2/3 in the population is identified and treated. Screen-positive (HPV, VIA, 6-mo AVE positive) women will be 1) randomly assigned to either the GBC or thermocoagulation, 2) undergo a rigorous colposcopic evaluation and biopsies to determine the (post-hoc) diagnosis of the cervical abnormality, and 3) undergo their assigned treatment if ablation eligibility or LEEP if ineligible based on WHO guidelines8. Adverse events and pain data will be collected systematically during the treatment visit and during an at-home, one month post-treatment visit by community health workers. Six- and 18-month follow-up visits will be used to assess effectiveness of these treatments against CIN2/3 and hrHPV. Nested studies will evaluate whether 1) specific HPV genotypes, CD4 and HIV viral load, and/or lesion size, location, and severity (i.e. imperfect adherence to WHO guidelines), are risk factors for treatment failures by each method and 2) deep-learning algorithms applied to digital images can predict ablative treatment failures and thereby used in the future to triage screen-positive women to LEEP instead of ablation and thereby potentially be avoided those treatment failures. Secondary analyses will assess the effectiveness of 12 different S&T strategies based on different combinations of 6 screening methods (hrHPV with no triage, hrHPV with triage using HPV genotype groups, hrHPV with VIA triage, hrHPV with AVE triage, VIA alone, or AVE alone) and two ablative methods. Project Narrative Women living in sub-Saharan Africa with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at the greatest risk of getting and dying from cervical cancer. The proposed study will compare two methods of treating cervical abnormalities for the prevention of cervical cancer in Mozambican women living with HIV.

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era.

"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,9774271,K99HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K99,2019,94578,246330700,0.17297123616379229
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9636556,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2019,168497,168440418,0.13964562602897596
"Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a training and research program that will enable the Candidate to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator with expertise in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) and maternal and child health.    The Candidate is an Infectious Disease physician trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, with experience in evaluating TB diagnostics, and implementation and evaluation of HIV and TB screening algorithms. For this K23 award, the career development plan will provide the Candidate with mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage influence latent tuberculosis (LTBI) infection test discordance.     HIV-infected individuals and infants have an increased risk of progression from Mtb infection to TB disease. Pregnant and postpartum periods have also been associated with increased risk of TB. Whether maternal HIV increases susceptibility to Mtb infection among peripartum women and their infants, and the dual roles of HIV and peripartum stage on latent TB testing are unknown.     The investigator proposes to develop new parallel prospective cohorts enrolling HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Research Specific Aims are to determine the: (Aim 1) effect of maternal HIV on risk and timing of maternal peripartum Mtb infection, (Aim 2) influence of maternal HIV on risk of infant Mtb infection, and (Aim 3) effect of maternal HIV status and peripartum stage on LTBI test performance, including interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). The incidence of maternal Mtb infection will be estimated and compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women using IGRA in pregnancy, and at 6 weeks, and 1 year postpartum. The prevalence of Mtb infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants will be compared at 6 and 12 months of age by IGRA. TST and IGRA discordance will be compared in pregnancy, early postpartum, and late postpartum within each maternal cohort and between HIV-infected and uninfected women. Potential cofactors for maternal and infant Mtb infection and maternal LTBI test discordance will be evaluated.     The Candidate proposes training designed to provide her skills in implementing prospective cohort studies and conducting complex longitudinal data analysis in maternal-infant cohorts as part of her research proposal, as well as in interventional trial design, cost-effectiveness and outcomes modeling to provide a foundation for future directions including submitting an R01 proposal. Skills will be gained through directed mentorship, didactic coursework, the proposed research plan, as well as additional mentor-identified opportunities to collaborate on international HIV/TB trials.     Her specific goals over the training period are to 1) gain proficiency in advanced logistic regression and linear mixed models, 2) develop content expertise in key areas of HIV/TB-related research in maternal child health settings, 3) lead a longitudinal epidemiologic study, 4) contribute to understanding epidemiologic correlates of Mtb infection in HIV-infected mothers and their children, 5) build a foundation in cost-effectiveness modeling including the use of composite risk-benefit maternal-infant outcomes, and 6) generate original data and scientific questions while expanding her publication record in order to successfully compete for independent funding at the R01 level. The Candidate has identified an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. John-Stewart, Gupta, Kinuthia, Richardson) and collaborators (Drs. Horne, Maleche-Obimbo, Cain, Levin) from University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nairobi, and CDC with expertise in HIV and TB epidemiology in women and children, longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, TB diagnostics, cost-effectiveness and infectious disease modeling. The Candidate's institution has a long-standing history of collaborative research in Kenya. Her mentors and institution have committed the resources needed to successfully advance her research independence.     The research findings will provide important data regarding TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and inform future TB interventional trials and models in the context of maternal/child health. This proposed project will provide the groundwork for the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden through evidence- based preventive strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sylvia LaCourse, MD, MPH, is an Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington. For this K23 award, the proposed career development plan and clinical research will allow the Candidate mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage are associated with latent tuberculosis infection test discordance. The research findings will provide important data regarding Mtb infection and TB epidemiology and pathogenesis in high HIV prevalence settings and inform future interventional trials and cost-effectiveness models to evaluate TB screening and preventive therapy approaches in the context of maternal/child health that will form the basis of the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden.",Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants,9672360,K23AI120793,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV/TB', 'Household', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type II', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health economics', 'health seeking behavior', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'infection risk', 'infectious disease model', 'instructor', 'intervention cost', 'isoniazid', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'trial design', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,184588,533302350,0.036995824753456814
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9644986,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'IMPAACT', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'perinatal HIV', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2019,188858,327644200,0.3527569620524907
"Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients This R21 application responds to RFA-MH-18-611 “Altered neuronal circuits, receptors and networks in HIV-induced Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction (R21)”. Despite effective viral suppression from combined antiretroviral therapy, up to 50% of the patients continue to have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The cognitive deficits or impairment in HIV patients may be due to legacy effects from early stages of the infection, residual viral reservoirs with ongoing neuroinflammation, and potential neurotoxicity from some of the antiretroviral medications. Furthermore, co-morbid disorders associated with the aging HIV+ population, the high prevalence of substance use, and host characteristics, may further increase the risk and exacerbate the severity of HAND. Optimal care for patients with HAND requires efficient and appropriate diagnosis that can guide effective treatments. However, the current diagnostic approach for HAND requires lengthy and specialized cognitive tests and involves subjective components. Our overall goal is to develop an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm to assess brain pathology, using objective measures such as alterations in structural connectivity on DTI, augmented with other neuroimaging and clinical variables. Ultimately, this may lead to a robust approach to classify subtypes and to quantify brain injury in HIV-infected individuals. This exploratory project has three specific aims (SA): SA1: Employ an automated unsupervised ML algorithm to detect subgroups of HIV-infected subjects, based solely on DTI tractography (structural connectivity). SA2: Add objective demographic, genetic, clinical, and non-DTI MR variables to the training DTI tractography data set, and determine their effects on predicting HAND and cognitive performance. SA3: Evaluate the optimized model for stability to undersampling, and determine whether it can be generalized to other data sets, including those from multi-center studies (i.e. Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study). Our optimized ML model has the potential to provide efficient, objective and reproducible biomarkers to identify individuals with or at risk for HAND, to guide prevention and treatment for HAND, and thereby ameliorate the burden of HIV infection and dementias. Narrative Although HIV-infected individuals can be treated and have normal life expectancies, up to 50% of them continue to suffer from cognitive problems that are often difficult to evaluate. The current exploratory study aims to use a machine learning algorithm to combine different types of brain imaging and clinical data to generate an objective and reproducible approach to assess brain injury associated with HIV-infection.

"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health",9774295,K08MH118094,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amphetamines', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cocaine', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'dual diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'mental health epidemiology', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'personalized management', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychiatric symptom', 'racial diversity', 'research and development', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,198696,807432003,0.2083514448320323
"Utilizing Twitter to Identify and Recruit Young Black Men at High Risk of HIV Infection Project Summary  The disproportionate incidence of HIV/AIDS among Black men underscores a dire need for technologically innovative and culturally-responsive approaches to reduce HIV in Black communities. There is evidence that social media platforms such as Twitter may offer an unprecedented opportunity to identify and recruit young Black men (YBM) at elevated risk, but to date there is a dearth of empirical evidence to support that social media based-recruitment using natural language processing is feasible and/or acceptable. On social media platforms like Twitter, young men share substance and sex related content. We propose mining these Twitter posts to identify YBM who may be at risk of elevated HIV, based on their substance and sexual risk posts. This study will serve as a proof of method to test the extent to which we can identify and recruit YBM based on their social media posts. We will extend and calibrate our “High-Risk Language” (HRL) algorithm to identify users who post HIV-risk related language on Twitter. Those who agree to participate and deemed eligible will complete a qualitative interview and in- person study visit which includes HIV testing, multi-drug screening, and a survey of their sexual risk and substance use behaviors. Our primary outcomes are; (1) condomless (and/or without PrEP) vaginal or anal sex and (2) illicit drug use before or during sex. We will assess the yield and accuracy of our HRL algorithm at identifying YBM at risk, compared to their biomarkers and surveys. This work will test cutting-edge research tools aimed at increasing the rigor and precision of online recruitment efforts to reduce HIV in the Black community. Project Narrative HIV prevention and care strategies require a synergistic approach to fight HIV in the Black community.

"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent applications of machine learning methods to epidemiologic data have led to discoveries of novel disease profiles with implications for clinical treatment and practice, including novel phenotypes of heart failure. Machine learning is attractive for large data sets because its algorithms can incorporate many more variables than standard regression methods, take into account temporality and other types of multidimensionality, and easily incorporate non-linearity and multiple interactions. Atherosclerosis is an ideal condition in which to apply machine learning methods, because its pathogenesis is known to be multifactorial, but precise causes are still not fully understood. In the context of HIV infection, its pathogenesis is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, potential adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV itself, mediated by immune activation and inflammation even in the context of long-term suppressive ART. We plan to apply the innovation of machine learning to discover new phenotypes of HIV-associated atherosclerosis that may reflect distinct pathways and affect clinical outcomes. Our Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) cohorts are two of the most well-established epidemiologic studies of HIV infection in existence. Each cohort has conducted serial imaging of atherosclerosis since 2002 in over 3,000 participants, and across 20-30 years of follow-up, cohort members have each contributed thousands of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data points. Most cohort members are now 50-59 years of age, while substantial numbers are in their sixth or seventh decade of life, allowing us to examine disease features and risk factors across the age spectrum. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected WIHS women and MACS men (Aim 1), and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes (Aims 2-3). Individuals with HIV infection have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. By using machine learning methods to identify novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis that may require different preventive or treatment interventions, this project has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults. 8.

"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment. Capitalizing on existing datasets, this project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments in active drug users.",MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications,9666893,R01DA045565,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'cocaine use', 'comparison group', 'connectome data', 'daily functioning', 'denoising', 'executive function', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non-drug', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention service', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'service delivery', 'sound', 'stimulant use', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,387690,607172798,0.2914062218494129
"Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis HIV-associated immunosuppression portends high risk for cryptococcal meningitis (CM). Despite progress that has increased HIV testing and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in resource-limited settings, the incidence and mortality of CM remain very high. In addition, ART can elicit immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), and CM also occurs in HIV- persons, including recipients of solid organ transplants and biologics. There are no host biomarkers to predict which HIV-infected (HIV+) patients will develop CM or C- IRIS. We are interested in the role antibody (Ab) immunity may play in resistance to CM, which is rare in people with intact immunity. We have contributed significant knowledge in this area, including recent data showing lower natural Laminarin (a β-glucan)-binding Ab levels in HIV+ patients with C-IRIS and positive serum cryptococcal antigen tests. Studies of HIV+ and HIV- patients revealed perturbations in Ab repertoires of patients with CM and C-IRIS, and lower IgM memory B cell levels in patients with CM. In mice, IgM memory homologs, B-1 cells and/or naïve IgM enhanced resistance to CM. These cells make Abs that bind microbial carbohydrates, e.g. the β-glucans on the Cn cell wall. The goal of this project is to probe the link between natural Ab and B cell responses to Cn and resistance to CM. We hypothesize CM risk will associate with deficiency of specific Cn- and/or β-glucan-binding Abs, stemming from B cell repertoire pertubations. Our aims are 1] To characterize Cn- and β-glucan-binding Abs of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, isolate monoclonal antibodies (huMabs) from normal persons and test their efficacy in mouse models. 2] To determine the ability of huMabs and GXM- and β-glucan-binding Abs to 1] exert direct effects on Cn viability and biology, and/or 2] mediate human effector cell Cn phagocytosis and/or killing. 3] To analyze B cell subsets, VH/VL repertoires, and transcriptional pathways of patients with and at risk for CM and C-IRIS, and controls, and use statistical modeling to identify signatures of CM risk. Knowledge gained from this project will inform tools to predict CM and C-IRIS risk, overcome roadblocks to diagnosis and therapy, provide new insight into the pathogenesis of CM, and inform development of immunotherapy and vaccines. PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a devastating form of meningitis that occurs most commonly in HIV-infected patients with profound T cell deficiency, but also occurs in patients with organ transplants, on biologics, and people with no apparent immune deficiency. Although anti-retroviral therapy has reduced the risk of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) in resourced areas, CM continues to ravage HIV-infected patients in Africa, Asia and other areas, even with increased availability of anti-retroviral and anti-fungal therapy. The 6- month survival of CM in resource-limited settings is 45-55%. This is worse than glioblastoma multiforme (66% 2-year survival). At present, there is no way to identify patients who will develop cryptococcosis. The goal of this application is to identify a risk profile to help determine which patients are at risk for CM. This will have a significant impact on prevention, diagnosis, and care of patients with CM and be a major public and global health advance.","Antibodies, B cells and resistance to human cryptococcosis",9846763,R01AI143453,"['Address', 'Africa', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asia', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cell Wall', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Cryptococcal Meningitis', 'Cryptococcosis', 'Cryptococcus', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Encapsulated', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glucans', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Meningitis', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morphology', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Persons', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Solid', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'beta-Glucans', 'differential expression', 'fungus', 'global health', 'glucuronoxylomannan', 'high risk', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immune reconstitution', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'insight', 'interest', 'laminaran', 'microbial', 'mind control', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'random forest', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'uptake', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,522712,199779478,0.2154149629713311
"Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche Abstract Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) is the most common AIDS-defining cancer. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced KS-associated mortality among AIDS patients; however, a serous clinical problem exists in that up to 50% of HIV+KS+ patients in the United States and 61% in Sub-Saharan Africa never achieve complete remission even with chemotherapy and a reduction in HIV viral loads. No definitive study has identified if there are tumor-associated features or mechanisms are associated with cART-progressive KS (progressors) vs. the responder (responders) phenotype. Our study utilizes a robust pre-cART KS tissue collection (n = 224) from the ACSR that originated from the Antiretrovirals for Kaposi's Sarcoma (ARKS) clinical trial. 36% of ARKS participants experienced continued progression of KS despite a reduction in viral loads and restored T-cell counts, in contrast to the rest of the cohort who experienced a reduction or elimination of tumors by the 1-year trial endpoint. This application poses several hypotheses concerning the progressor phenotype: 1) prior to the initiation of cART, an increase in HIV and/or KSHV-infected immune cells enhances a stimulatory immunological profile in the progressor phenotype, 2) there are significant differences in the upregulation of KSHV lytic and immunomodulation genes, which stimulate increased immune cell recruitment into the pre-cART tumor microenvironment and promote tumor progression through cytokine-signaling inflammatory processes enhanced in part by the cART-revitalized immune system, 3) the highly inflammatory nature of KS tumors, comprising a complex mixture of immune cells with which to interact, selects for unique and/or elusive HIV genotypes, distinct from plasma HIV, that promote stimulatory processes to continue in the progressor phenotype. Our Specific Aims address these hypotheses using a combination of advanced immunohistochemistry, virus specific cellular localization (DNA and RNAscope), high-throughput gene expression analysis (RNAseq), and a novel deep sequencing approach applied to HIV. Innovations include the unprecedented amount pre-cART KS tumor material available for the study, advanced imagining technologies, in vivo KS tumors gene expression studies, the use of the newer PacBio SMRT sequencing approach applied to HIV, and machine-learning approaches that can define non-linear associations in complex data sets. This project will define the largest well-characterized set of combinatorial features related to cART-associated KS outcomes derived directly from KS-associated biomaterial. Identifying clinically relevant immune factors in the tumor niche pre-cART will pave the way for the development of future mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in cART resistant tumor progression. Project Narrative Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) successfully reduces the risk of progressive Kaposi's sarcoma in the majority of HIV infected people; however, up to 50% of those treated will never retrieve remission, even when viral loads are reduced and the immune system is restored. In this project we will to determine the pre-cART tumor features that identify the progressor phenotype. With the ability to differentiate between the progressor and responder outcome categories, a simple biopsy prior to cART could elucidate a better combinatorial treatment approach.",Pathogenesis of the cART unresponsive Kaposi’s sarcoma tumor niche,9756172,R01CA239263,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'B-Cell Activation', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cytokine Signaling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'HIV', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 8', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Kaposi Sarcoma', 'Lytic Virus', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physical environment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serous', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Tropism', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cytokine', 'deep sequencing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'novel', 'recruit', 'single molecule real time sequencing', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,578668,685608202,0.15266398569162964
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9776494,R01DA047820,"['Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Association Learning', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Methylation', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Veterans', 'Women’s Interagency HIV Study', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cocaine use', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'frailty', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'painful neuropathy', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'substance misuse', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,599984,550947887,0.2545946997080073
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9689397,R01AI127203,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'data mining', 'deep learning algorithm', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'surveillance data', 'survival outcome', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2019,633579,45219910,0.38163612975832617
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,9593017,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biological Assay', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV therapy', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'standard care', 'theories', 'treatment program', 'virology']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,663842,127562714,0.18602849351462716
"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9739366,R01DA047149,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cannabis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated cognitive impairment', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'addiction', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'drug of abuse', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'sound', 'stem', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,667194,607172798,0.30394291684308666
"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9657555,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Analyses', 'Demographic and Health Surveys', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Program Efficiency', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cohort', 'health goals', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'testing services', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,683442,560644462,0.3593805792144436
"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring.

Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9987247,R01AI132030,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Engineering', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Facebook', 'HIV', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,794640,167717872,0.319899262625575
"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,9619411,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Behavior assessment', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exclusion', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Health', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropathogenesis', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'geriatric neuroHIV', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monocyte', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'prospective', 'sex', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,1122349,685608202,0.08879868831694425
"Machine learning-based profiles of atherosclerosis to predict disease outcomes in older HIV-infected women and men 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent applications of machine learning methods to epidemiologic data have led to discoveries of novel disease profiles with implications for clinical treatment and practice, including novel phenotypes of heart failure. Machine learning is attractive for large data sets because its algorithms can incorporate many more variables than standard regression methods, take into account temporality and other types of multidimensionality, and easily incorporate non-linearity and multiple interactions. Atherosclerosis is an ideal condition in which to apply machine learning methods, because its pathogenesis is known to be multifactorial, but precise causes are still not fully understood. In the context of HIV infection, its pathogenesis is further complicated by multiple comorbidities, potential adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and HIV itself, mediated by immune activation and inflammation even in the context of long-term suppressive ART. We plan to apply the innovation of machine learning to discover new phenotypes of HIV-associated atherosclerosis that may reflect distinct pathways and affect clinical outcomes. Our Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) cohorts are two of the most well-established epidemiologic studies of HIV infection in existence. Each cohort has conducted serial imaging of atherosclerosis since 2002 in over 3,000 participants, and across 20-30 years of follow-up, cohort members have each contributed thousands of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data points. Most cohort members are now 50-59 years of age, while substantial numbers are in their sixth or seventh decade of life, allowing us to examine disease features and risk factors across the age spectrum. We propose to use machine learning methods to develop novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis among HIV-infected WIHS women and MACS men (Aim 1), and then determine the utility of these phenotypes by assessing their associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and other age-related clinical and functional outcomes, including traditional “geriatric” outcomes (Aims 2-3). Individuals with HIV infection have evidence of accelerated aging; prior studies have typically evaluated isolated outcomes despite the fact that aging is inherently a multifactorial and complex process. By using machine learning methods to identify novel phenotypes of atherosclerosis that may require different preventive or treatment interventions, this project has the potential to lead to new insights into the role of aging in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis among HIV-infected adults. 8.

"HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary I propose to implement an innovative mixed methods study using machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The study aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are the semantic features of social media communication (i.e., key terms and concepts) among YBMSM related to their HIV prevention and care engagement?; (2) How are structural features of observed social media relationships among YBMSM related to their prevention and care engagement?; and (3) Can social media use patterns predict future prevention and care engagement? To pursue these questions, I will draw on data collected March 2016-March 2019 from YBMSM participants in an ongoing network HIV prevention intervention (N=423). Prevention and care engagement behaviors include retention in care (HIV/PrEP/Primary), STI/HIV testing, and condom use. Participant social media data include: (1) Facebook posts, (2) Facebook friendships, and (3) Facebook group memberships. K99 Phase: Research conducted during the K99 Phase will use machine learning techniques for textual analysis, semantic network characterization, and regression models to identify the semantic features of participants' communication and their association with HIV prevention and care engagement. I will receive mentored training in 5 key areas: (1) knowledge of issues relevant to HIV prevention, care and treatment for MSM; (2) machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling; (3) advanced stochastic network modeling, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs); and (4) design and implementation of social media based interventions for health promotion; and (5) professional development. R00 Phase: For the R00 I will employ one-mode and two- mode ERGMs to determine how prevention and care engagement behaviors affect the structure of observed social media relationships. I will then develop a predictive model for prevention and care engagement on the basis of individuals' social media use patterns. This K99/R00 award mechanism will be critical to my success in achieving long-term success as an expert in the social and communicative dynamics of HIV prevention and care engagement in high-risk populations. It will also pave the way to an R01 application – based on a longitudinal design – of YMSMs' social and communication engagement in a more diverse array of online social networking sites, including both general purpose and dating platforms. The goal of this project will be to utilize that information to establish classes of YMSM on the basis of their heterogeneous patterns of social media use to better understand their synergistic effects on HIV prevention and care engagement practices over time. This is an important next step in understanding how online social environments impact prevention engagement and will help identify causal relationships that may be amenable to network intervention. Project Narrative This proposal is an innovative mix methods design that utilizes machine learning techniques for text analytics and predictive modeling in combination with advanced social network analysis to provide valuable information about the online communicative and social contexts that contribute to HIV prevention and care engagement among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). The proposed research will sharpen our understanding of the degree to which online social environments support protective or risky behavioral norms and, consequently the degree to which they reveal viable points for intervention. It will also demonstrate how social media data can help front-line staff profile clients in near real-time and predict future HIV-related outcomes like retention failure, thereby serving as an indicator to guide decisions on screening, treatment, and other service provisions.",HIV Prevention and Care,9623550,K99HD094648,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Friends', 'Friendships', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Affiliation', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'HIV/STD', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterosexuals', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Service provision', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Network', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'black men who have sex with men', 'cohort', 'condoms', 'design', 'digital', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal design', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'network models', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'predictive modeling', 'protective behavior', 'response', 'screening', 'sexual health intervention', 'social', 'social communication', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'socialization behavior', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'willingness', 'young adult', 'young men who have sex with men']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K99,2018,94832,246330700,0.17297123616379229
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9424658,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2018,171483,168440418,0.13964562602897596
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS.

"Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a training and research program that will enable the Candidate to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator with expertise in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) and maternal and child health.    The Candidate is an Infectious Disease physician trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, with experience in evaluating TB diagnostics, and implementation and evaluation of HIV and TB screening algorithms. For this K23 award, the career development plan will provide the Candidate with mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage influence latent tuberculosis (LTBI) infection test discordance.     HIV-infected individuals and infants have an increased risk of progression from Mtb infection to TB disease. Pregnant and postpartum periods have also been associated with increased risk of TB. Whether maternal HIV increases susceptibility to Mtb infection among peripartum women and their infants, and the dual roles of HIV and peripartum stage on latent TB testing are unknown.     The investigator proposes to develop new parallel prospective cohorts enrolling HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Research Specific Aims are to determine the: (Aim 1) effect of maternal HIV on risk and timing of maternal peripartum Mtb infection, (Aim 2) influence of maternal HIV on risk of infant Mtb infection, and (Aim 3) effect of maternal HIV status and peripartum stage on LTBI test performance, including interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). The incidence of maternal Mtb infection will be estimated and compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women using IGRA in pregnancy, and at 6 weeks, and 1 year postpartum. The prevalence of Mtb infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants will be compared at 6 and 12 months of age by IGRA. TST and IGRA discordance will be compared in pregnancy, early postpartum, and late postpartum within each maternal cohort and between HIV-infected and uninfected women. Potential cofactors for maternal and infant Mtb infection and maternal LTBI test discordance will be evaluated.     The Candidate proposes training designed to provide her skills in implementing prospective cohort studies and conducting complex longitudinal data analysis in maternal-infant cohorts as part of her research proposal, as well as in interventional trial design, cost-effectiveness and outcomes modeling to provide a foundation for future directions including submitting an R01 proposal. Skills will be gained through directed mentorship, didactic coursework, the proposed research plan, as well as additional mentor-identified opportunities to collaborate on international HIV/TB trials.     Her specific goals over the training period are to 1) gain proficiency in advanced logistic regression and linear mixed models, 2) develop content expertise in key areas of HIV/TB-related research in maternal child health settings, 3) lead a longitudinal epidemiologic study, 4) contribute to understanding epidemiologic correlates of Mtb infection in HIV-infected mothers and their children, 5) build a foundation in cost-effectiveness modeling including the use of composite risk-benefit maternal-infant outcomes, and 6) generate original data and scientific questions while expanding her publication record in order to successfully compete for independent funding at the R01 level. The Candidate has identified an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. John-Stewart, Gupta, Kinuthia, Richardson) and collaborators (Drs. Horne, Maleche-Obimbo, Cain, Levin) from University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nairobi, and CDC with expertise in HIV and TB epidemiology in women and children, longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, TB diagnostics, cost-effectiveness and infectious disease modeling. The Candidate's institution has a long-standing history of collaborative research in Kenya. Her mentors and institution have committed the resources needed to successfully advance her research independence.     The research findings will provide important data regarding TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and inform future TB interventional trials and models in the context of maternal/child health. This proposed project will provide the groundwork for the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden through evidence- based preventive strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sylvia LaCourse, MD, MPH, is an Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington. For this K23 award, the proposed career development plan and clinical research will allow the Candidate mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage are associated with latent tuberculosis infection test discordance. The research findings will provide important data regarding Mtb infection and TB epidemiology and pathogenesis in high HIV prevalence settings and inform future interventional trials and cost-effectiveness models to evaluate TB screening and preventive therapy approaches in the context of maternal/child health that will form the basis of the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden.",Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants,9458090,K23AI120793,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Household', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type II', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health economics', 'health seeking behavior', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'infectious disease model', 'instructor', 'intervention cost', 'isoniazid', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'trial design', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2018,184588,533302350,0.036995824753456814
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9440337,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'IMPAACT', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'perinatal HIV', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2018,188858,327644200,0.3527569620524907
"Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health PROJECT SUMMARY  Psychiatric disorders and substance misuse are prevalent among people with HIV (PWH) and have negative effects on HIV control. These conditions impose substantial emotional and physical burdens, impede the achievement of virologic suppression, and are associated with behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. While it is common for PWH to have multiple psychiatric diagnoses, relatively little is known about the ways in which combinations of psychiatric symptoms and substance misuse behaviors confer elevated risk for poor HIV control, or how to personalize the management of these commonly co-occurring disorders. Furthermore, estimates of the potential public-health impact of mental health service innovations on the HIV epidemic are generally lacking. Recent innovations in statistics and machine learning make it possible to harness complex data to identify patterns of psychiatric disease in PWH and tailor psychiatric therapy to optimize HIV control in ways that classical statistical approaches cannot.  The candidate is a translational and computational investigator and general internal medicine physician at Johns Hopkins University with a background in computer science and biostatistics. During this award period, he will be mentored by a team whose expertise spans HIV care, psychiatric epidemiology, machine learning, population-level HIV modeling, and personalized medicine. The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent, translational researcher who applies innovative statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the health of individuals and populations at the intersection of HIV and mental health.  The overarching objective for this project is to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing models that leverage complex data to inform patient care and public policy. Three aims will be undertaken: (1) to identify how combinations of symptoms of depression and anxiety and misuse of alcohol, cocaine, opioids, marijuana, and amphetamines impact individual-level HIV control; (2) to use repeated patient-reported measures of depression, anxiety, and substance misuse to predict future mental health and HIV control under a potential pharmacotherapies; and (3) to develop population models that project the impact of mental health service interventions on HIV incidence and mortality. The models will leverage data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a racially diverse, multi-site cohort of over 31,000 PWH.  This mentored research will be accompanied by relevant skills training in mental health epidemiology, the care of PWH, and advanced Bayesian and machine-learning methods. Collectively, this research and career development training will provide a clear pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator focused on optimizing the management of psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in PWH at both the individual and population level. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric comorbidities and substance misuse present major obstacles for many persons with HIV in achieving virologic suppression, with negative consequences for both individual and population health. I propose to address psychiatric disorders and substance misuse in the context of the HIV continuum of care by developing innovative models that leverage complex patient data (1) to guide the care of individual persons with HIV and mental illness and (2) to inform policy decisions about systems-level interventions in mental health. As part of a mentored research training program, this award will allow me to become a leading independent researcher with the expertise to leverage complex individual- and population-level data to optimize the health of individuals and populations with HIV who suffer from mental illness.","Optimizing outcomes at the intersection of HIV and mental health: Prediction, precision medicine, and population health",9623793,K08MH118094,"['Achievement', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amphetamines', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cocaine', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatric epidemiology', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'dual diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'mental health epidemiology', 'metropolitan', 'mortality', 'personalized management', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'psychiatric symptom', 'racial diversity', 'research and development', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'substance misuse', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'transmission process', 'virology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,199128,807432003,0.2083514448320323
"Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients This R21 application responds to RFA-MH-18-611 “Altered neuronal circuits, receptors and networks in HIV-induced Central Nervous System (CNS) dysfunction (R21)”. Despite effective viral suppression from combined antiretroviral therapy, up to 50% of the patients continue to have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The cognitive deficits or impairment in HIV patients may be due to legacy effects from early stages of the infection, residual viral reservoirs with ongoing neuroinflammation, and potential neurotoxicity from some of the antiretroviral medications. Furthermore, co-morbid disorders associated with the aging HIV+ population, the high prevalence of substance use, and host characteristics, may further increase the risk and exacerbate the severity of HAND. Optimal care for patients with HAND requires efficient and appropriate diagnosis that can guide effective treatments. However, the current diagnostic approach for HAND requires lengthy and specialized cognitive tests and involves subjective components. Our overall goal is to develop an unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithm to assess brain pathology, using objective measures such as alterations in structural connectivity on DTI, augmented with other neuroimaging and clinical variables. Ultimately, this may lead to a robust approach to classify subtypes and to quantify brain injury in HIV-infected individuals. This exploratory project has three specific aims (SA): SA1: Employ an automated unsupervised ML algorithm to detect subgroups of HIV-infected subjects, based solely on DTI tractography (structural connectivity). SA2: Add objective demographic, genetic, clinical, and non-DTI MR variables to the training DTI tractography data set, and determine their effects on predicting HAND and cognitive performance. SA3: Evaluate the optimized model for stability to undersampling, and determine whether it can be generalized to other data sets, including those from multi-center studies (i.e. Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study). Our optimized ML model has the potential to provide efficient, objective and reproducible biomarkers to identify individuals with or at risk for HAND, to guide prevention and treatment for HAND, and thereby ameliorate the burden of HIV infection and dementias. Narrative Although HIV-infected individuals can be treated and have normal life expectancies, up to 50% of them continue to suffer from cognitive problems that are often difficult to evaluate. The current exploratory study aims to use a machine learning algorithm to combine different types of brain imaging and clinical data to generate an objective and reproducible approach to assess brain injury associated with HIV-infection. Our approach, if validated, may provide a useful biomarker to evaluate brain injury and monitor treatments in these patients in both research and clinical settings.",Machine Learning to Generate a Multivariate Model of Brain Injury in HIV Patients,9623490,R21NS108811,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Choline', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Guide prevention', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Prevalence', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Viral reservoir', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'axon injury', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'effective therapy', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'myoinositol', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'receptor', 'tractography', 'unsupervised learning', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2018,231750,230060143,0.2238947763428782
"MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications Project Summary  Despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, nearly half of the 1.2 million Americans living with HIV experience neurocognitive impairments (NCI) that negatively impact daily functioning. HIV-associated NCI is estimated to be the most common form of midlife NCI worldwide. Drug abuse, a highly prevalent comorbidity in HIV+ persons, increases the risk of HIV-associated NCI. Unimodal MRI studies have shown that HIV and drug abuse are each linked with a distinct set of structural and functional alterations in the brain, but how they interact is not well understood. Conventional unimodal analyses are limited in their ability to characterize complex neuropsychiatric diseases because each modality provides an incomplete view of the brain. In contrast, we propose to use innovative fusion approaches that exploit the richness of multimodal data to discover covariations across multiple neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measures simultaneously. This proposal capitalizes on existing data from 3 completed NIDA-funded projects on the neurobehavioral effects of HIV and drug abuse. When combined, the dataset will consist of 217 unique cases (108 HIV+ and 109 HIV-) with in-depth substance use histories, multimodal brain images (i.e., structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI), comprehensive neurocognitive batteries, and a wide range of other phenotypic data. The central hypothesis is that HIV-specific co-alterations in gray matter volume and white matter integrity shape neural functioning and in turn NCI, and that cocaine use worsens these alterations due to its long-term effects on neural circuitry. Using complementary multimodal analyses (supervised fusion and connectomics), we aim to: (1) identify neural biomarkers of HIV neurological disease and associated NCI; and (2) test cocaine as a moderator of HIV-specific co-alterations in brain structure and function and associated NCI. In addition, the project will develop new, advanced methods to improve MRI data quality for cross-study harmonization and to optimize the prediction of NCI based on multimodal indices. This amalgamated dataset provides an unprecedented opportunity to test new and clinically important hypotheses about the neural substrates of HIV- associated NCI in the context of drug abuse. The proposal responds directly to the need for research to “characterize brain morphology or function that is aberrant as a consequence of chronic drug use” and “[its role] in the evolving dynamics of HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and service delivery” [PAR- 16-234]. This research also addresses high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including investigation of neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers of neuroHIV that may facilitate diagnosis and treatment monitoring in active drug users and serve as targets for clinical interventions to mitigate the burden caused by HIV-associated NCI. Public Health Relevance  Nearly half of HIV-infected Americans experience neurocognitive impairments that impact daily functioning, and the prevalence is even higher among persons who are addicted to stimulant drugs. Using innovative multimodal data fusion approaches, this study will identify the distinct and shared neural signatures of HIV neurological disease and cocaine use disorder that are predictive of neurocognitive impairment. Capitalizing on existing datasets, this project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments in active drug users.",MRI data fusion to investigate effects of drug abuse on HIV neurological complications,9554396,R01DA045565,"['AIDS diagnosis', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'cocaine use', 'comparison group', 'daily functioning', 'executive function', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'non-drug', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention service', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'service delivery', 'sound', 'stimulant use', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,412771,607172798,0.2914062218494129
"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9459809,R01AI132030,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Engineering', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'HIV', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,491174,673201228,0.319899262625575
"Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN) remains the most common neurological complication in HIV-infected population. Opiates and cocaine are often misused to manage neuropathic pain. These drugs, in turn, increase the risk of DSPN and exacerbate DSPN severity. The interplay of DSPN and substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although neurotoxic effects of HIV-1 gp120 and antiretroviral medications contribute to DSPN through dysregulation of pro-inflammation genes, little is known about the mechanisms of DSPN and DSPN with comorbid SUD. A major barrier to advancing our understanding of DSPN is the inaccessibility of nerve tissues in living individuals and the absence of reliable biomarkers to inform the diagnosis of DSPN in the setting of SUD and HIV infection. Our overarching goal is to discover the DNA methylation signatures for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We focus on white blood cells (WBCs) because of their role in orchestrating and effecting immune responses and because they are highly accessible tissues. We hypothesize that DSPN emerges in the context of HIV infection as the result of HIV-1 enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in many cell types, including WBCs. We also hypothesize that DSPN emerges as the result of SUD-enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes in WBCs. Thus, DNA methylation in WBCs is associated with DSPN that is influenced by SUD and contributes to HIV outcomes. To test the hypotheses, we will select methylation features in WBCs for DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity using a combination of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and ensemble-based machine learning approaches. Leveraging two well-established independent cohorts, we will first identify methylation sites in WBCs for DSPN and SUD in four groups (DSPN+/SUD+, DSPN+/SUD-, DSPN-/SUD+, DSPN-/SUD-) in 2,000 HIV- infected samples using a 2-stage EWAS followed by a meta-EWAS. We will then select methylation features using machine learning methods and test the sensitivity and specificity to differentiate DSPN, SUD, and their comorbidity. We will apply our in-house developed bioinformatic package, smartFeatureSelection. The selected features will test associations with immune resilience (i.e. CD4+/CD8+) and HIV outcomes (i.e. frailty, mortality). Finally, we will explore the biological functions of the identified methylation sites in postmortem human brain and blood (N = 80) by RNA-seq and correlate methylation-regulated gene expression between WBCs and neural cells. We expect to discover a set of biologically meaningful methylation features as a marker for HIV- infected DSPN and SUD that can predict resilience and outcomes. Employing a rigorous design and a powerful computational approach, this application proposes the first epigenome-based prediction for DSPN, SUD, and their interaction. The identified features can serve as a biomarker for this complex condition and have potential clinical use. The results will enhance the knowledge of epigenetic mechanisms in blood and in brain for HIV-infected DSPN and SUD. Distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance use disorder are common in the HIV-infected population and can impact immune resilience and HIV outcomes. Applying a combination of epigenome-wide association and machine learning approaches, we aim to identify a panel of DNA methylation features in white blood cells for HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy and substance misuse that link to immune resilience, HIV frailty and mortality. The selected features can serve as biomarker for neuropathy and enhance our understanding of the interplay between neuropathy and substance misuse in HIV-infected population.",Feature selection of DNA methylation biosignatures for neuropathy with comorbid drug abuse in the setting of HIV infection,9687814,R01DA047820,"['Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Association Learning', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'DNA Methylation', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distal', 'Drug abuse', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Veterans', 'Women’s Interagency HIV Study', 'base', 'biosignature', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cocaine use', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug misuse', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'frailty', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'opioid use', 'painful neuropathy', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'substance misuse', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,606847,550947887,0.2545946997080073
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health.

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9512753,R01AI127203,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care seeking', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'intervention program', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'surveillance data', 'survival outcome', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2018,633579,45219910,0.38163612975832617
"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9460355,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Analyses', 'Demographic and Health Surveys', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Program Efficiency', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cohort', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'testing services', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666329,560644462,0.3593805792144436
"Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study Project Summary  Despite widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), nearly half of HIV+ Americans will experience HIV-related neurological comorbidities that negatively impact daily functioning and clinical outcomes. Alterations in brain structure and function are consistently linked to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms through which HIV causes alterations in neural networks and associated cognitive function are not well characterized. Marijuana use, which is disproportionately prevalent among HIV+ persons, may increase the risk of HAND. Our preliminary work suggests that co-occurring marijuana use and HIV infection intensifies dysfunction in major neural networks, including white matter abnormalities and decoupling of functional activation patterns. Capitalizing on a strong foundation of neurobehavioral research on drug addiction and HIV/AIDS by our multidisciplinary team, the proposed research will apply connectomic analyses to achieve the following aims: (1) examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and marijuana on structural and functional organization of the brain; (2) investigate the longitudinal relationship between network-level disruptions in brain organization and cognitive impairment; and (3) use machine deep learning algorithms to develop individualized prediction models for HAND diagnosis and severity based on multimodal graph features. Using a cross-lagged panel design, 200 adults stratified by HIV and marijuana status (4 groups) will have multimodal MRIs and cognitive testing at baseline and 1 year later. The central hypothesis is that marijuana use will exacerbate structural and functional disruptions in brain organization that underlie the expression and progression of HAND. Our proposal responds directly to RFA-18- 610, which highlights the need for studies on “the underlying mechanisms whereby drugs of abuse and HIV infection interact to impair CNS functions mediated through altered neuronal networks.” This research uses a team science approach to address high priority topics for AIDS-designated funding, including neurological complications [NOT-15-137]. Building upon a sound premise and robust preliminary data, this innovative project has strong potential to identify appropriate neural biomarkers that may aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of HAND in persons with chronic substance use disorders and serve as targets for novel clinical interventions. In addition, our classification models are expected to provide a generalizable framework applicable to individual patients for tailoring of treatment approaches. Public Health Relevance  Of the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS, nearly half will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders that impact daily functioning. Marijuana, the mostly commonly abused drug among HIV-infected persons, may accelerate the development and progression of neurocognitive impairments. This study applies a connectomics approach to examine how HIV and marijuana interact to disrupt neural networks that underlie cognitive functioning, with implications for the development of improved diagnostics and treatments.",Role of cannabis on HIV-related cognitive impairment:  a brain connectomics study,9621881,R01DA047149,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cannabis', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Equilibrium', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Testing', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'addiction', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'daily functioning', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'drug of abuse', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'sound', 'stem', 'white matter']",NIDA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,675269,607172798,0.30394291684308666
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,9378081,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biological Assay', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Caring', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV therapy', 'Individual', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'standard care', 'theories', 'treatment program', 'virology']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,680826,127562714,0.18602849351462716
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9542909,R01MH109320,"['Adherence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Fumarates', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection prevention', 'Ingestion', 'Injectable', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Spottings', 'Technology', 'Tenofovir', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'diaries', 'efficacy trial', 'emtricitabine', 'facial recognition software', 'forgetting', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'pill', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'real time monitoring', 'sex risk', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'volunteer', 'young man', 'young men who have sex with men']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2018,760876,8376678,0.18076751625398393
"Identification of Biomarkers of CNS injury and resilience related to HIV-1 and Methamphetamine PROJECT SUMMARY Methamphetamine (METH) is commonly abused and is a risk factor for HIV. METH also increases risk for adverse outcomes during HIV, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Multiple studies have demonstrated the neurotoxic effects of METH and HIV on brain structure and function, as well as neurobehavioral and functional performance. Biomarkers of central nervous system (CNS) injury and resilience would be valuable tools for understanding the METH- and HIV-associated pathogenesis and could provide valuable insights for drug development. The effects of METH and HIV outside the CNS (e.g., vascular and metabolic disease) are also important to consider and are a key gap in the field. Another key gap in the field is the translation of research findings to the clinic, including biomarkers that may be used to detect METH- and HIV-associated CNS injury and functional impairment across disease stages. Even less is known about biomarkers of resilience of the host defense mechanisms. Thus, in response to RFA-DA-18-023, this project proposes to screen a comprehensive panel of clinical and research biomarkers reflective of pathology and resilience with the goal of identifying and validating biosignatures that may improve the clinical assessment and diagnosis of brain and peripheral complications associated with METH and HIV. To accomplish this, we propose to leverage NIDA’s prior investment in UCSD’s NIDA-funded Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which performed standardized neurobehavioral, neuroimaging, and neuromedical assessments of participants who differed by METH use and HIV infection. We will recall and comprehensively re-assess 200 of these participants. Neuroimaging methods will include measures of cerebral blood flow, CNS metabolite levels, and a novel neuroimaging measure to estimate integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will measure a comprehensive biomarker panel in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and stool samples, in specimens from their prior baseline visit, which are stored, and from their new visit and then analyze the data using traditional statistical approaches as well as novel techniques rooted in machine-learning and causal inference modeling. This approach will provide unique longitudinal data that will allow for the identification of biosignatures that predict changes in CNS injury and resilience. We will validate the observed biosignatures in an independent cohort of 100 participants who have been previously assessed at UCSD’s HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program and who have comprehensive data and stored specimens (e.g., CSF) available. To better respond to the clinical translation objective of the RFA, we will also compare measured biomarkers to data that are obtained during routine clinic assessments with the goal of identifying a clinical biosignature of METH- and HIV-related CNS injury. A thorough understanding of the impact of METH and HIV on systemic and CNS processes will address key gaps in the field. This insight should also inform the development of assays to inform diagnosis and effective disease and treatment monitoring.

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,9475306,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Exclusion', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Health', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropathogenesis', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monocyte', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'prospective', 'sex', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,1116125,685608202,0.08879868831694425
"She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum Project Summary/Abstract A significant relationship exists between intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. IPV-exposed women are almost 10 times more likely to report an HIV infection. Extant research indicates multiple direct (e.g., forced sex with risky partner) and indirect (e.g., poor mental health) pathways linking IPV experiences to HIV risk. Developing ways to prevent HIV among IPV-exposed women that is not partner-dependent is needed. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is a daily oral medication and may be the most viable and novel HIV prevention option for IPV-exposed women. However, engaging in PrEP care can be hard including multiple steps (e.g., daily adherence, quarterly medical visits). Women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum may be disrupted by four HIV-related risk factors (economic instability, sexual autonomy, substance abuse, depressive symptoms). First, economic instability can make women dependent on their abusive partner for money and insurance, which may hinder PrEP uptake and adherence. Second, women with low sexual autonomy (e.g., freedom to express one's sexual self) may feel unable or uncomfortable using PrEP if her partner disagree with her wish to use PrEP, which can prevent PrEP uptake. Lastly, substance abuse and feelings of depression can disrupt cognition, making it difficult to engage in daily functions, which may prevent PrEP adherence. To date, there is a dearth of studies examining the implications of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum, despite the potential barriers associated with IPV. This is concerning since the Trans-NIH HIV- Related Research Priorities called for research addressing how violence influences experiences along the HIV prevention continuum. This F31 aims to improve the sexual health of women across these research aims: (1a) Examine the effects of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum (i.e., interest, uptake, adherence, follow-up visits), and HIV-related risk factors using data from a cohort study of women (n=250); (1b) Explore four HIV-related risk factors as mediators linking IPV and the PrEP care continuum; and (2) Describe women's experiences and processes along the PrEP care continuum (n=32). The proposed research addresses a critical need to understand the relationship between IPV and women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum in order to implement PrEP care in a safe and effective way. This research will devise PrEP engagement strategies, inform intervention development, and help the fight against HIV/AIDS for women. During this 2-year research and training fellowship, the applicant will develop interdisciplinary social science skills including advancing statistical analysis skills, gaining experience in mixed-methods study design and qualitative data analysis, while refining academic and scientific communication. This comprehensive training program will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent violence epidemiologist and academic mentor conducting empirical IPV research while designing HIV prevention interventions with for women. Project Narrative Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a viable option for IPV-exposed women, but the impact of IPV on women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum is unclear. This study seeks to use mixed methods to understand if and how IPV impacts women's engagement in the PrEP care continuum.",She's PrEPared: The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women's Engagement in the PrEP Care Continuum,9410681,F31MH113508,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Economics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Face', 'Federal Aid', 'Feeling', 'Fellowship', 'Forcible intercourse', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Insurance', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Oral', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safe Sex', 'Sexual Health', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'career', 'daily functioning', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'fight against', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'intimate partner violence', 'medication compliance', 'novel', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'prevent', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'uptake']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,550947887,0.20268265932174354
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 – those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 – risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9235662,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2017,173475,168440418,0.13964562602897596
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence.

"Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a training and research program that will enable the Candidate to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator with expertise in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) and maternal and child health.    The Candidate is an Infectious Disease physician trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, with experience in evaluating TB diagnostics, and implementation and evaluation of HIV and TB screening algorithms. For this K23 award, the career development plan will provide the Candidate with mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage influence latent tuberculosis (LTBI) infection test discordance.     HIV-infected individuals and infants have an increased risk of progression from Mtb infection to TB disease. Pregnant and postpartum periods have also been associated with increased risk of TB. Whether maternal HIV increases susceptibility to Mtb infection among peripartum women and their infants, and the dual roles of HIV and peripartum stage on latent TB testing are unknown.     The investigator proposes to develop new parallel prospective cohorts enrolling HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Research Specific Aims are to determine the: (Aim 1) effect of maternal HIV on risk and timing of maternal peripartum Mtb infection, (Aim 2) influence of maternal HIV on risk of infant Mtb infection, and (Aim 3) effect of maternal HIV status and peripartum stage on LTBI test performance, including interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). The incidence of maternal Mtb infection will be estimated and compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women using IGRA in pregnancy, and at 6 weeks, and 1 year postpartum. The prevalence of Mtb infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants will be compared at 6 and 12 months of age by IGRA. TST and IGRA discordance will be compared in pregnancy, early postpartum, and late postpartum within each maternal cohort and between HIV-infected and uninfected women. Potential cofactors for maternal and infant Mtb infection and maternal LTBI test discordance will be evaluated.     The Candidate proposes training designed to provide her skills in implementing prospective cohort studies and conducting complex longitudinal data analysis in maternal-infant cohorts as part of her research proposal, as well as in interventional trial design, cost-effectiveness and outcomes modeling to provide a foundation for future directions including submitting an R01 proposal. Skills will be gained through directed mentorship, didactic coursework, the proposed research plan, as well as additional mentor-identified opportunities to collaborate on international HIV/TB trials.     Her specific goals over the training period are to 1) gain proficiency in advanced logistic regression and linear mixed models, 2) develop content expertise in key areas of HIV/TB-related research in maternal child health settings, 3) lead a longitudinal epidemiologic study, 4) contribute to understanding epidemiologic correlates of Mtb infection in HIV-infected mothers and their children, 5) build a foundation in cost-effectiveness modeling including the use of composite risk-benefit maternal-infant outcomes, and 6) generate original data and scientific questions while expanding her publication record in order to successfully compete for independent funding at the R01 level. The Candidate has identified an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. John-Stewart, Gupta, Kinuthia, Richardson) and collaborators (Drs. Horne, Maleche-Obimbo, Cain, Levin) from University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nairobi, and CDC with expertise in HIV and TB epidemiology in women and children, longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, TB diagnostics, cost-effectiveness and infectious disease modeling. The Candidate's institution has a long-standing history of collaborative research in Kenya. Her mentors and institution have committed the resources needed to successfully advance her research independence.     The research findings will provide important data regarding TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and inform future TB interventional trials and models in the context of maternal/child health. This proposed project will provide the groundwork for the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden through evidence- based preventive strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sylvia LaCourse, MD, MPH, is an Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington. For this K23 award, the proposed career development plan and clinical research will allow the Candidate mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage are associated with latent tuberculosis infection test discordance. The research findings will provide important data regarding Mtb infection and TB epidemiology and pathogenesis in high HIV prevalence settings and inform future interventional trials and cost-effectiveness models to evaluate TB screening and preventive therapy approaches in the context of maternal/child health that will form the basis of the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden.",Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants,9262876,K23AI120793,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Household', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type II', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health economics', 'health seeking behavior', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'infectious disease model', 'instructor', 'isoniazid', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'trial design']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2017,184588,533302350,0.036995824753456814
"Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in patient-oriented HIV research, seven of whom have secured K funding and four of whom are now R-funded . She is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. Her mentees will have access to a wealth of research opportunities in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that Dr. Lockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere, ranging from randomized trials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens (many in pregnant women and their infants) to observational and epidemiologic studies of clinical outcomes among HIV-infected adults and HIV-exposed children. In the proposed K24, she will leverage the unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a large ongoing randomized HIV combination prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000 with longitudinal cohort of 12,000 adults), in order to mentor investigators from Botswana and the US on pressing questions of substantial public health and clinical relevance to the severe epidemic still affecting sub-Saharan Africa. For context, UNAIDS is promoting high levels (90% or greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and virologic suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite nearly meeting these targets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult population of Botswana on ART (and recent implementation of universal ART), it is essential that we understand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes and non-communicable disease incidence in persons living with HIV at the population level. We will therefore: a) Characterize adults with recent HIV infection using predictive analysis, in order to identify groups at highest risk for HIV acquisition in the current epidemic, and augment our understanding with individual in-depth interviews with recently- infected adults; b) Study the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of a targeted approach to TDF/FTC pre- exposure prophylaxis, offered to HIV-negative persons meeting this high-risk profile; c) Evaluate the impact of HIV (and of early ART) on clinical outcomes, including c ancer incidence and hypertension prevalence in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected adults, and HIV-related outcomes among persons starting dolutegravir- vs. efavirenz-based ART. In addition, Dr. Lockman will also mentor junior investigators on projects nested within a new large randomized IMPAACT trial of 3 antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy that that she leads, and in prior large perinatal HIV studies in Botswana that enrolled more than 9,000 mother-infant pairs. This K24 is critical, to support the protected time and resources that are required for Dr. Lockman to mentor junior investigators from both the US and Botswana in patient-oriented research. NARRATIVE Dr. Lockman has a long and successful track record mentoring more than 20 fellows, junior faculty, and students from the US and Africa in global patient-oriented HIV research (many of whom have gone on to conduct funded research of their own), and is deeply committed to continuing and expanding this mentoring, which serves as the primary impetus for this K24 grant. In this project, she will harness unique and extensive infrastructure, data and samples from a randomized HIV prevention trial that she and others are conducting in 30 communities in Botswana (total population 180,000), in order to study questions of major public health importance in the new reality of universal antiretroviral treatment (regardless of HIV disease stage)--namely, whether it is feasible and acceptable to identify and offer proven HIV prevention interventions to HIV-negative persons at high risk for acquiring HIV; and what the longer-term health implications of HIV (and of universal treatment) are, for the health of HIV-infected and –uninfected people (including hypertension and cancer risk).",Addressing Major HIV Prevention and Health Outcomes Questions in an Era of Universal ART: Mentoring in a Community-Randomized Trial,9349125,K24AI131928,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Botswana', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV prevention trial', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Hypertension', 'IMPAACT', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Circumcision', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mothers', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Students', 'Tenofovir', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'community intervention', 'efavirenz', 'emtricitabine', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'meetings', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'point of care', 'population based', 'pre-exposure prophylaxis', 'randomized trial', 'treatment program', 'trial design', 'uptake', 'virology']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2017,190858,327644200,0.3527569620524907
"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",9215532,R01NR014789,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Association Learning', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Managed Care', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Seasons', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Conditions', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'care systems', 'clinical practice', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'inter-institutional', 'medical specialties', 'multilevel analysis', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'software systems', 'time use', 'viral RNA']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,371958,673201228,0.346498677112351
"Neutralization Fingerprinting Analysis of Polyclonal Antibody Responses against HIV-1 Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health. Project Narrative  This project aims at developing next-generation neutralization fingerprinting algorithms for the analysis of antibody specificities in polyclonal responses against HIV-1. Overall, this work will build a more complete picture of the broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes on Env, and will lead to a better understanding of the antibody responses against HIV-1 both at the individual and population levels.

"Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction Project Summary/Abstract. Early HIV diagnosis as well as linkage into and retention in HIV medical care for HIV+ individuals is important for patient survival and treatment. Missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis continues even with recommended routine HIV testing. National and South Carolina (SC) estimates of retention in HIV medical care are slightly above fifty percent, indicating a gap in HIV treatment. With significant proportions of HIV+ individuals not receiving HIV medical care, improved outcomes of care and HIV prevention as part of national HIV/AIDs strategies are difficult to achieve. The purpose of this study is to use novel machine learning algorithms to further explore, identify, characterize, and explain predictors of missed opportunities for HIV medical care utilization among all living HIV+ individuals in SC. Profiles of HIV+ individuals based on their patterns of HIV medical care seeking behavior will be developed with concomitant identification of both gaps in HIV care and missed opportunities for reengagement into HIV care. Health utilization behavior for HIV+ individuals' pre-HIV diagnosis also will be studied to identify where missed opportunities for HIV testing occurs. Findings will be integrated with the ongoing effort of the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)'s Data-to-Care (DTC) program as well as the Ryan White Care Program. The public health value that HIV treatment brings includes improved survival outcomes of care among HIV+ individuals as well as reduced HIV transmission. These important components form part of the overall strategy for fighting and controlling the HIV epidemic in the United States and aligns closely with the strategic goals of reducing new HIV infections. Using state-level CD4 and Viral Load (VL) testing data available for all SC HIV+ individuals since 2004, the study will link inpatient and outpatient claims data sources, the state electronic HIV/AIDS reporting system, Area Health Resource Files, and data from the state corrections database to create a unique population based dataset spanning 10 years (2004-2013). Advanced Big Data analytical algorithms will be used to create person-level profile patterns of pre- and post- HIV diagnosis health utilization behaviors and for identifying best predictors of linkage and retention in HIV medical care. These algorithms will be useful in unearthing hidden features/predictors of HIV medical care utilization. A predictive model useful for predicting where HIV+ individuals who are not in care will access routine medical care (missed opportunities) also will be developed. Findings will provide fresh guidance for public health interventions targeting early HIV testing and linkage to and retention in HIV medical care for SC HIV-infected individuals. Project Narrative. Treatment as a public health strategy of HIV prevention is important in fighting the national HIV epidemic. Early diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in HIV medical care are key public health strategies for HIV prevention. Missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis as well as inadequate HIV medical care utilization by HIV+ individuals in South Carolina negatively impacts HIV survival outcomes, while increasing population transmission risks. The analyses of population-based health utilization data for HIV+ individuals using powerful machine learning techniques such as deep learning algorithms will generate new factors useful for improving retention in HIV care. This valuable new information will be translated into ongoing efforts such as SC's Data-to Care and Ryan White care efforts through improved targeting of HIV medical care engagement and reengagement interventions.",Big Data analytics of HIV treatment gaps in South Carolina: Identification and prediction,9404773,R01AI127203,"['AIDS prevention', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Human Resources', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Patterns of Care', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'base', 'care seeking', 'data mining', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'intervention program', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'surveillance data', 'survival outcome', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2017,655554,45219910,0.38163612975832617
"Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa Project Summary/Abstract HIV is the largest single cause of death among adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, responsible for about a third of all deaths among adults. One of the key paradigms to halting HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa relies on identification of infected individuals and populations for delivery of biomedical and behavioral interventions. However, by the end of 2015 less that half of HIV-infected individuals accessed antiretroviral therapy (ART) despite expansion of eligibility and ongoing efforts to diagnose and initiate treatment. A better understanding of the social, behavioral, environmental, and economic contexts that influence HIV risk could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of programs that aim to identify and target HIV-infected populations. In response to the program announcement for “Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV” (PA-15-273), the overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools in large-scale data to predict risk of HIV infection and to generate hypotheses about new or under-recognized risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa. We plan four primary investigations: (1) Extract and harmonize all Sub- Saharan African nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys that include the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in 29 countries, and hundreds to thousands of associated exposure variables; (2) Develop analytic tools based on LASSO and XWAS to predict HIV infection status and generate hypotheses about social, behaviorial, environmental, an economic risk factors; (3) Identify HIV risk in multi-country, large-scale data and synthesize findings across in Sub-Saharan Africa, and (4) develop a bioethics program to identify targets for new interventions and policies in a culturally and ethically sound manner. The project will develop leverage big data and high-throughput analytic methodology in the service of global HIV control. The outputs of this project include (1) accessible software code for efficient exploration of robust correlates of HIV status derived from the biggest collection of high-dimensional, harmonized, and nationally representative representative household surveys in the world, (2) an extensive landscape of the social, environmental, behavioral, and economic factors predictive of HIV infection among over 600K people tested for HIV in 29 Sub- Saharan countries, and (3) a ethical framework to enable practical, relevant, and appropriate translation and communication of findings. New models of HIV infection will facilitate identification of at-risk groups and the development of interventions to halt the HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. Project Narrative Advancing the the public health goals for global HIV, including the “AIDS-Free Generation” and “90-90- 90,” requires effective identification of HIV-infected individuals. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new analytic tools to (1) predict HIV status using modern tools of statistical machine learning and (2) uncover new and under-recognized risk factors for HIV infection in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using person-level data including the HIV status of over 600,000 men and women collected in nationally representative household surveys from 29 countries, we propose to build a high-throughput statistical predictor of HIV status and apply a novel “X-wide association study” (XWAS) to search for and validate social, behavioral, environmental, and economic factors associated with HIV seropositivity. Through development of an ethical/decision making framework and with close consult of an advisory committee, the findings will be used to develop both broad and specific insights about risk factors and at-risk populations for improving HIV care and epidemiology.",Big Data Analysis of HIV Risk and Epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa,9349034,R01AI127250,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Catalogs', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Analyses', 'Demographic and Health Surveys', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV risk', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Household', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Factor', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Program Efficiency', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Social Behavior', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cohort', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,691929,560644462,0.3593805792144436
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,9174892,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biological Assay', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Caring', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV therapy', 'Individual', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'standard care', 'theories', 'treatment program', 'virology']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,695576,127562714,0.18602849351462716
"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority for public health organizations. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to 1) develop software to allow (non- technical) researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses, and 2) interview participants to learn about the ethical issues that need to be addressed when building this software. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9349408,R01AI132030,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Engineering', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'HIV', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'public health priorities', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,717574,673201228,0.319899262625575
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices.

"Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60 The CDC estimated that one-quarter of Americans living with HIV were over the age of 55 in 2012. By next year, they will be over age 60, entering into the age demographic where Alzheimer's disease (AD) becomes a distinct differential for clinicians. Because up to one-half of people living with HIV experience cognitive impairment from HIV or related factors along, the likelihood for delayed diagnosis of early AD is substantial. Differentiating HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) from the Mild Cognitive Impairment stage of AD (MCI-AD) is one of the most pressing issues in geriatric neuroHIV. Current HAND nosology does not provide guidance on this issue. Published work suggests the likelihood for distinct phenotypes that would facilitate diagnostic sorting with commonly available inputs from neuropsychological testing and structural imaging. In this application, we will use a new approach that leverages computational machine learning with inputs from structural imaging, neuropsychological testing, motor examination and affective/behavioral assessments to determine the factors that most accurately discriminate HAND from MCI-AD. Our preliminary examinations using this novel technique demonstrate a likelihood that this approach will provide diagnostic sorting that exceeds 90% accuracy. We will examine tightly characterized phenotypes using HIV tests to exclude HAND and PET amyloid scanning to exclude AD among 75 HIV+/amyloid marker negative participants with HAND to 50 HIV-negative/amyloid+ cases with MCI (MCI-AD group), all age, sex and disease severity matched and all over age 60, the population of interest due to dual risk. Our methodology will iterate the most distinctive aspects of each disease's phenotype to inform sorting and subsequently, guidelines. We will validate the identified inputs that most clearly contribute to the algorithm though clinical correlations and through the ability of the determined clusters (e.g. diagnostic group) to predict the meaningful outcomes of disease progression. The long-term goal of this work is to inform clinical guidelines, thus, the modalities examined are readily available in clinical care. This work will also extend our understanding of neuropathology in older HIV patients and may identify factors that shift paradigms because our novel approach does not rely on a priori assumptions to inform neuropsychological abnormalities and brain structural alterations linked to HAND in older age. In an exploratory aim, we extend this examination of HAND neuropathogenesis with the added examination of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and a monocyte associated inflammatory marker, soluable CD163 (sCD163), two measures tightly linked to HAND in published work among virally suppressed patients in the current era. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will examine how clinicians can determine if older patients with HIV are also suffering from early Alzheimer's disease (AD). With patients now living into age ranges where both diseases become possible, guidance on how to distinguish impairment due to HIV from the early stages of AD is critically needed.",Machine learning to distinguish HAND from Alzheimer's disease in HIV over age 60,9343421,R01MH113406,"['Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Exclusion', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Health', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropathogenesis', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'middle age', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'monocyte', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'prospective', 'sex', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,1064206,685608202,0.08879868831694425
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence.

"Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a training and research program that will enable the Candidate to achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinical investigator with expertise in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) and maternal and child health.    The Candidate is an Infectious Disease physician trained in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, with experience in evaluating TB diagnostics, and implementation and evaluation of HIV and TB screening algorithms. For this K23 award, the career development plan will provide the Candidate with mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage influence latent tuberculosis (LTBI) infection test discordance.     HIV-infected individuals and infants have an increased risk of progression from Mtb infection to TB disease. Pregnant and postpartum periods have also been associated with increased risk of TB. Whether maternal HIV increases susceptibility to Mtb infection among peripartum women and their infants, and the dual roles of HIV and peripartum stage on latent TB testing are unknown.     The investigator proposes to develop new parallel prospective cohorts enrolling HIV-infected and uninfected pregnant women and their infants. Research Specific Aims are to determine the: (Aim 1) effect of maternal HIV on risk and timing of maternal peripartum Mtb infection, (Aim 2) influence of maternal HIV on risk of infant Mtb infection, and (Aim 3) effect of maternal HIV status and peripartum stage on LTBI test performance, including interferon gamma-release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests (TST). The incidence of maternal Mtb infection will be estimated and compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women using IGRA in pregnancy, and at 6 weeks, and 1 year postpartum. The prevalence of Mtb infection in HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants will be compared at 6 and 12 months of age by IGRA. TST and IGRA discordance will be compared in pregnancy, early postpartum, and late postpartum within each maternal cohort and between HIV-infected and uninfected women. Potential cofactors for maternal and infant Mtb infection and maternal LTBI test discordance will be evaluated.     The Candidate proposes training designed to provide her skills in implementing prospective cohort studies and conducting complex longitudinal data analysis in maternal-infant cohorts as part of her research proposal, as well as in interventional trial design, cost-effectiveness and outcomes modeling to provide a foundation for future directions including submitting an R01 proposal. Skills will be gained through directed mentorship, didactic coursework, the proposed research plan, as well as additional mentor-identified opportunities to collaborate on international HIV/TB trials.     Her specific goals over the training period are to 1) gain proficiency in advanced logistic regression and linear mixed models, 2) develop content expertise in key areas of HIV/TB-related research in maternal child health settings, 3) lead a longitudinal epidemiologic study, 4) contribute to understanding epidemiologic correlates of Mtb infection in HIV-infected mothers and their children, 5) build a foundation in cost-effectiveness modeling including the use of composite risk-benefit maternal-infant outcomes, and 6) generate original data and scientific questions while expanding her publication record in order to successfully compete for independent funding at the R01 level. The Candidate has identified an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. John-Stewart, Gupta, Kinuthia, Richardson) and collaborators (Drs. Horne, Maleche-Obimbo, Cain, Levin) from University of Washington, Johns Hopkins University, University of Nairobi, and CDC with expertise in HIV and TB epidemiology in women and children, longitudinal cohort studies and clinical trials, TB diagnostics, cost-effectiveness and infectious disease modeling. The Candidate's institution has a long-standing history of collaborative research in Kenya. Her mentors and institution have committed the resources needed to successfully advance her research independence.     The research findings will provide important data regarding TB epidemiology and pathogenesis, and inform future TB interventional trials and models in the context of maternal/child health. This proposed project will provide the groundwork for the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden through evidence- based preventive strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sylvia LaCourse, MD, MPH, is an Acting Instructor in the Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the University of Washington. For this K23 award, the proposed career development plan and clinical research will allow the Candidate mentored learning in advanced epidemiologic, biostatistical, and health economics modeling methods while investigating whether maternal HIV is associated with increased risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in peripartum women and their infants, and if HIV and pregnancy stage are associated with latent tuberculosis infection test discordance. The research findings will provide important data regarding Mtb infection and TB epidemiology and pathogenesis in high HIV prevalence settings and inform future interventional trials and cost-effectiveness models to evaluate TB screening and preventive therapy approaches in the context of maternal/child health that will form the basis of the Candidate's career goal to become an independent clinical researcher with a focus on improving the health of women and their children in areas of high HIV/TB burden.        ",Impact of maternal HIV on Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum women and their infants,9137077,K23AI120793,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Assay', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Economic Models', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Household', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type II', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kenya', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Outcome', 'Paternal Exposure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive therapy', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tuberculin Test', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic screening', 'effectiveness clinical trial', 'epidemiologic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health economics', 'health seeking behavior', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'infectious disease model', 'instructor', 'isoniazid', 'mortality', 'performance tests', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'skills', 'trial design']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2016,171164,533302350,0.036995824753456814

Alcohol screening followed by routine brief intervention (BI) for screen-positive patients is widely recommended and now covered as a standard benefit under the Affordable Care Act. However, little is known regarding whether UAU is appropriately addressed in HIV+ patients receiving care, and there is currently no standard approach to monitor drinking changes over time in HIV+ patients. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System is the largest provider of HIV care in the U.S. and is leading other systems in implementing alcohol screening and BI. SPECIFIC AIMS. This study will make use of unique secondary VA data to: 1) Describe and compare receipt of BI among outpatients with UAU across HIV status; 2) Evaluate whether documented BI is associated with resolution of UAU among HIV+ outpatients with repeat alcohol screening; and 3) Evaluate whether changes in alcohol screening scores are associated with concomitant changes in HIV-related outcomes (ART adherence, markers of disease progression, and mortality risk based on the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index). APPROACH. This study applies validated algorithms and coding from VACS to unique VA data that includes repeated measures of alcohol screening and brief intervention in a cohort of ~ 7.4 million outpatients in care (1/2009 -12/2013). Aim 1 analyses will be conducted among all patients who screen positive for UAU and uses logistic regression to estimate the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of documented BI for HIV+ and HIV- outpatients. Aim 2 analyses will be conducted in the sample of HIV+ patients who screen positive for UAU and have repeat screening 12-24 months later and uses logistic regression to estimate the prevalence and 95% CIs of resolution of UAU for patients with and without documented BI. Aim 3 analyses will be conducted among HIV+ patients who have initial and repeat screening 12-24 months later. Fixed-effect regression models will evaluate the association between changes in alcohol screen scores and changes in all scaled HIV-related outcomes. Aims 1 and 2 analyses will be adjusted for patient-level covariates. Aim 3 uses ""first-difference"" techniques, which implicitly adjust for all time-invariant subject-specific characteristics, including those that are measured and those that are not. IMPACT. This research uses unique national data with repeated measures of alcohol screening and BI to understand whether population-based implementation of alcohol screening and BI is reaching and effective for HIV+ patients and to determine whether routine clinical alcohol screening-which is increasingly being implemented into healthcare systems-can be used to monitor drinking outcomes in HIV+ patients for whom UAU is particularly risky. This research will inform other healthcare systems implementing alcohol screening and BI in response to healthcare reform and could lay a foundation for future comparative effectiveness research both within and across health systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed innovative implementation evaluation uses a unique national dataset to understand whether population-based implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention is reaching and effective for HIV+ patients, or whether more will be needed for this vulnerable population for whom unhealthy alcohol use is particularly risky. In addition, this study will evaluate whether routine clinical alcohol screening can be used to monitor drinking outcomes in HIV+ patients. This research will inform other healthcare systems implementing alcohol screening and brief intervention in response to healthcare reform, and may help lay the foundation for future comparative effectiveness research both within and across health systems.",Alcohol-related Care & Outcomes for Outpatients with HIV in a National VA Cohort,9014465,R21AA022866,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'Viral Load result', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol screening and brief intervention', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brief alcohol screening', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'drinking', 'effectiveness research', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'population based', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'therapy adherence', 'time use']",NIAAA,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R21,2016,195448,148927,0.11341864026064566
"Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will aim to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using state-of-the-art social media and game technology to increase HIV testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA) ages 13-24. Rates of HIV testing among AYA are low, resulting in high proportions of AYA who are positive or unaware of their HIV infection. Further, public health messages which can be effective in older adults do not achieve the same results in AYA. Since many AYA are highly engaged with social media and games, these technologies may hold the key to reaching this population. While previous behavior change games have shown positive results by using the compelling nature of gameplay to make health education entertaining and shift attitudes towards disease prevention, this intervention proposes to incorporate a new innovation which changes the way video games are used to increase HIV testing and linkage to care. The intended result is a novel social media experience which plays like a game while prompting dialogue about HIV risk assessment, testing, and linkage to care-- in a population more interested in dialogue than in hearing one-way health promotion messages. We hypothesize that the intended result will be both a marketable product and an effective, evidence-based behavioral intervention that increases access to and uptake of HIV testing and linkage to care among AYA. Our multidisciplinary team will recruit AYA to assist in informing the development of a prototype social media game accessible from smartphones, tablets, and the Web. The intervention will be developed with input from AYA, as well as health care providers, to increase acceptability and conduct feasibility testing and revisions to increase game performance and acceptability. During a 6-month period, we will work with AYA to assess the acceptability of the game and its potential impact on perceptions of HIV risk, prevention and testing; perceptions regarding barriers to testing and linkage to care, changes in motivation and readiness to test, and increased self-efficacy regarding health promotion and HIV prevention. We anticipate the results will demonstrate feasibility and provide data to inform a Phase II study to test the efficacy of the game on increasing testing and linkage to care through a larger randomized controlled trial as well as provide a more significant level of feedback on playability, art and animation styles, player engagement, and overall acceptability. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate how this product may advance the effective implementation of an evidence-based behavioral intervention for increased testing and linkage to care among youth. Successful development of this core technology could also be revised to be applicable to other medical conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the feasibility and acceptability of linking young people to HIV testing and care services through social media gameplay. The project focuses on the development of an innovative, culturally-appropriate and youth-appropriate game to help players assess their personal HIV risk through engaging, personalized gameplay. The game rewards players for HIV testing and linkage to care, and sharing the game with others via social networks.        ",Routinizing HIV testing for Adolescents,9147193,R43HD088332,"['AIDS prevention', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Chlamydia', 'Choice Behavior', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Gonorrhea', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Hearing', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Program Development', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Readiness', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Perception', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Surveys', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Video Games', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age group', 'animation', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior influence', 'design', 'digital', 'disorder prevention', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health belief', 'high risk behavior', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'social media', 'surveillance data', 'uptake']",NICHD,"MEDIA REZ, LLC",R43,2016,224278,1636948,0.25264291908085645
"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",9010628,R01NR014789,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Association Learning', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Managed Care', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Site', 'Social Conditions', 'Staging', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'care systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic minority population', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'inter-institutional', 'medical specialties', 'multilevel analysis', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'software systems', 'time use']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,374408,673201228,0.346498677112351
"Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues Social “big data” holds information with wide-ranging implications for addressing issues along the HIV care continuum. Social big data refers to information from social media and online platforms on which individuals and communities create, share, and discuss content. One in four people worldwide, or over a billion people, are publically documenting their activities, intentions, moods, opinions, and social interactions on these sites. They are doing so with increasing volume and velocity, including 400 million “tweets” per day on Twitter and 4.75 billion content items shared per day on Facebook. With an increasing number of these platforms supporting access to publicly-available user data, social big data analysis is a promising new approach for attaining organic observations of behavior that can be used to monitor and predict real-world public health problems, such as HIV incidence. New tools such as social data are therefore needed to supplement existing HIV data collection methods.  In preliminary research, our team developed the first approach that identifies psychological and behavioral characteristics from social big data (>550 million tweets) found to be associated with HIV diagnoses. Since groups at the highest risk for HIV (e.g., minority populations) are the fastest growing Twitter users, and because social media users have been found to publicly share personal information, we identified and collected tweets suggesting HIV risk behaviors (e.g., drug use, high-risk sexual behaviors, etc.) and modeled them alongside CDC statistics on HIV diagnoses. We found a significant positive relationship between HIV- related tweets and county-level HIV cases, controlling for socioeconomic status measures and other variables.  The problem is that this approach is not currently scalable for use by HIV researchers and public health organizations. Although public health agencies are interested in mining social data to address HIV, current tools are not accessible to most health scientists, as the tools require advanced computer science expertise. For example, analyzing 500 million tweets a day requires expertise in big data engineering, advanced machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Developing a single platform for mining social data that has been designed and tested by and for HIV researchers could provide a significant impact on HIV prevention, testing, and treatment. We seek to create a single automated platform that collects social media data; identifies, codes, and labels tweets that suggest HIV-related behaviors; and ultimately predicts regional HIV incidence. Because of the potential ethical issues associated with mining people's data, we also seek to interview staff at local and regional HIV organization and participants affected by HIV to gain their perspectives on the ethical issues associated with this approach. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.   Project Narrative  Surveillance and monitoring of HIV and related risk behaviors is a top priority. This project is of particularly high impact because it seeks to develop software to allow researchers to analyze real-time conversations from social media big data to monitor HIV diagnoses. It also will provide data on the ethical issues associated with the increasing number of these “social data mining” approaches. The software developed from this application will be shared with HIV researchers and health care workers to provide additional tools that can be used to combat the spread of HIV.",Mining real-time social media big data to monitor HIV: Development and Ethical Issues,9317061,R56AI125105,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Engineering', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'HIV', 'HIV diagnosis', 'HIV risk', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'behavior observation', 'case control', 'combat', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'health organization', 'high risk', 'high risk sexual behavior', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'social', 'social media', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2016,671438,673201228,0.31321575782836825
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,8960923,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological Assay', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Caring', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV antiretroviral', 'HIV therapy', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'standard care', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,708750,127562714,0.18602849351462716
"DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several efficacy trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (daily antiretroviral therapy to prevent HIV acquisition in uninfected persons with sexual exposures) have failed because of poor adherence to medications. To ensure accurate, longitudinal measurement of pill ingestion with real-time monitoring, we plan to develop DOT Diary (D2), a smartphone application that uses artificial intelligence for measuring pill taking using Directly Observed Therapy. This patented technology will be combined with a daily sexual diary for use in future PrEP observational and efficacy trials. Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9147007,R01MH109320,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Fumarates', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Ingestion', 'Injectable', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Tenofovir', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'diaries', 'efficacy trial', 'emtricitabine', 'forgetting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'pill', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sex risk', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'volunteer', 'young man']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2016,861189,8376678,0.18076751625398393
"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8762403,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hexamethylene Bisacetamide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Probability', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Virus', 'Vorinostat', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'drug mechanism', 'high standard', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'purge', 'reactivation from latency', 'tool']",NIAID,J.

Such an approach provides aggregated data for individual participants, study sites, and trials overall, that facilitates realtime feedback to maximize adherence. We plan a 3 stage process for building and evaluating D2. First, we will assess the assess the reliability and validity of the automated DOT tool to identify attempts to ""cheat"" and over-report pill taking, as well as to evaluate the sensitivity of the measure to detecting 1- to 3-week interruptions in pill use. Second, we will develop and optimize the feasibility and acceptability of D2 for participants and study staff in tracking participation ver time, and providing real-time adherence feedback to study participants. Lastly, we will run a 24-week pilot study of D2 for high-risk men who have sex with men to evaluate the plausibility that this tool can be successfully used to measure and optimize adherence in future PrEP trials.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many studies of pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP (giving an anti-HIV medication to an HIV uninfected person to prevent infection from their HIV positive sex partner) have failed to tell us whether or not the medication prevents infection, because very few of the study volunteers took the pills regularly. We will be developing and testing a new technology called DOT Diary (D2) that will be used by PrEP study volunteers to take pictures (using their smartphones) of themselves taking their pills, and also using their phones to keep track of their sexual practices. This will allow future studies to provide extra support for study volunteers not taking their medicines regularly, and to figure out whether or not the medications prevent new HIV infections.            ",DOT Diary (D2): Developing a mobile app with combined automated DOT and daily sexual diary for monitoring and improving PrEP adherence,9040821,R01MH109320,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Directly Observed Therapy', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Ingestion', 'Injectable', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Legal patent', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Regimen', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Site', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'diaries', 'efficacy trial', 'emtricitabine', 'forgetting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'meetings', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'pill', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sex risk', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'tuberculosis treatment', 'volunteer', 'young man']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R01,2015,143296,8376678,0.18076751625398393
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence.

"Alcohol-related Care & Outcomes for Outpatients with HIV in a National VA Cohort     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is common among HIV+ patients and associated with poorer adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), increased HIV disease progression, and poorer survival. Alcohol screening followed by routine brief intervention (BI) for screen-positive patients is widely recommended and now covered as a standard benefit under the Affordable Care Act. However, little is known regarding whether UAU is appropriately addressed in HIV+ patients receiving care, and there is currently no standard approach to monitor drinking changes over time in HIV+ patients. The Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System is the largest provider of HIV care in the U.S. and is leading other systems in implementing alcohol screening and BI. SPECIFIC AIMS. This study will make use of unique secondary VA data to: 1) Describe and compare receipt of BI among outpatients with UAU across HIV status; 2) Evaluate whether documented BI is associated with resolution of UAU among HIV+ outpatients with repeat alcohol screening; and 3) Evaluate whether changes in alcohol screening scores are associated with concomitant changes in HIV-related outcomes (ART adherence, markers of disease progression, and mortality risk based on the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) Index). APPROACH. This study applies validated algorithms and coding from VACS to unique VA data that includes repeated measures of alcohol screening and brief intervention in a cohort of ~ 7.4 million outpatients in care (1/2009 -12/2013). Aim 1 analyses will be conducted among all patients who screen positive for UAU and uses logistic regression to estimate the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of documented BI for HIV+ and HIV- outpatients. Aim 2 analyses will be conducted in the sample of HIV+ patients who screen positive for UAU and have repeat screening 12-24 months later and uses logistic regression to estimate the prevalence and 95% CIs of resolution of UAU for patients with and without documented BI. Aim 3 analyses will be conducted among HIV+ patients who have initial and repeat screening 12-24 months later. Fixed-effect regression models will evaluate the association between changes in alcohol screen scores and changes in all scaled HIV-related outcomes. Aims 1 and 2 analyses will be adjusted for patient-level covariates. Aim 3 uses ""first-difference"" techniques, which implicitly adjust for all time-invariant subject-specific characteristics, including those that are measured and those that are not. IMPACT. This research uses unique national data with repeated measures of alcohol screening and BI to understand whether population-based implementation of alcohol screening and BI is reaching and effective for HIV+ patients and to determine whether routine clinical alcohol screening-which is increasingly being implemented into healthcare systems-can be used to monitor drinking outcomes in HIV+ patients for whom UAU is particularly risky. This research will inform other healthcare systems implementing alcohol screening and BI in response to healthcare reform and could lay a foundation for future comparative effectiveness research both within and across health systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed innovative implementation evaluation uses a unique national dataset to understand whether population-based implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention is reaching and effective for HIV+ patients, or whether more will be needed for this vulnerable population for whom unhealthy alcohol use is particularly risky. In addition, this study will evaluate whether routine clinical alcohol screening can be used to monitor drinking outcomes in HIV+ patients. This research will inform other healthcare systems implementing alcohol screening and brief intervention in response to healthcare reform, and may help lay the foundation for future comparative effectiveness research both within and across health systems.                ",Alcohol-related Care & Outcomes for Outpatients with HIV in a National VA Cohort,8789119,R21AA022866,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Health Care Reform', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Veterans', 'Viral Load result', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol screening and brief intervention', 'alcohol use disorder', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'brief alcohol screening', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'drinking', 'effectiveness research', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'therapy adherence', 'time use']",NIAAA,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,239050,148927,0.11341864026064566
"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION: Surveillance estimates indicate an alarming resurgence of new HIV/AIDS cases among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), highlighting the importance of re-examining prevention modalities and behavior change strategies. After diagnosis, persons living with HIV continue to engage in sexual and drug use behaviors that increase the risk for transmission of HIV. By continuing to engage in unprotected sex, HIV+ YMSM put themselves at risk of transmitting HIV to their partners, becoming re-infected with another strain of HIV, and/or acquiring other STIs. Individuals who communicate with sex partners about condom use and sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, have been found to be more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. However, disclosure represents a challenging situation which is a universal and recurrent stressor in the lives of HIV+ persons. Despite being recognized as a critical component of prevention interventions directed at MSM, there is currently no stand-alone, easily delivered disclosure intervention. Moreover, there is a need to design interventions that engage the targeted population without the requirement of extensive training of facilitators who traditionally provide in person role plays, a method that will always e limited by lack of availability and scalability. Developing an ecologically relevant, artificially intelligent (AI) technology tool to offer the opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill implementation, in a safe and engaging manner, is highly innovative, relevant and needed. This tool would be able to address the context (e.g., the emotionally charged experience of disclosure), content (the highly stigmatizing nature of an HIV diagnosis), and possible consequences (both positive and negative). Such a tool offers the added benefit of constant availability for the user to practice and receive feedback for each trial of practice while providig the possibility of a rewarding and reinforcing technology that shapes targeted behaviors to be more effective. The central goal of this proposal, titled, ""Tough Talks: A disclosure intervention for HIV+ YMSM,"" is to create a safe, internet-delivered software program that will offer intelligen virtual character-driven scenarios that are engaging, interactive, ecologically sensitive, and user-centric in content and design, all focused on increasing mastery of important skills associated with disclosure of HIV status. In Phase I, Tough Talks will be a novel prevention tool that will address sexual health communication with sex partners in the context of addressing disclosure of HIV status. If this paradigm is successful, this intervention would represent a highl customizable solution that could be expanded to address HIV disclosure among MSM to family and friends or adapted to deal with disclosure among other HIV infected populations or for other contagious and/or stigmatizing conditions where disclosure is challenging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing sexual risk among HIV-infected YMSM, the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence, begins with negotiation of safer sex behaviors with current and potential sex partners. Individuals who can communicate with sex partners about sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, are more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. Therefore, HIV status disclosure represents an important underdeveloped public health strategy to address ongoing sexual risk behaviors. Despite being recognized as a critical component of prevention interventions, there is currently no stand-alone, easily delivered HIV disclosure intervention. Developing an ecologically relevant, artificially intelligent (AI) technology tool to offer the opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill implementation as it relates to disclosure of HIS status, in a safe and engaging manner, is highly innovative, relevant and needed.

"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",8836596,R01NR014789,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Association Learning', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Managed Care', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Site', 'Social Conditions', 'Staging', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'care systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'multilevel analysis', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'software systems', 'time use']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,376982,673201228,0.346498677112351
"Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With escalating global access to HIV antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, treatment failure is inevitable and must be anticipated. Correct and early diagnosis of treatment failure is essential for cost savings, durable response to therapy and prevention of morbidity and mortality. Most HIV treatment programs in the developing world either do not have access to viral load (VL) testing, the gold-standard treatment monitoring modality, or can apply it only on a limited basis. Other monitoring technologies such as drug resistance testing are even less common for financial and infrastructure constraints. In this proposal we will develop, evaluate and implement methods to optimize monitoring of ARV therapy in resource limited settings (RLS) that have diverse VL availability. Though several recent studies have proposed and evaluated lower-cost markers as VL surrogates and strategies for selective VL use, they generally are not based on a formal, decision theoretic framework that allows discovery of strategies with optimality properties that can be expressed in terms of misclassification rate, cost, and other clinically relevant parameters. We propose to develop the statistical framework, theory and methods required to discover optimal diagnostic algorithms for monitoring treatment failure with limited or no VL availability; to use cohort data from both the US and Kenya to derive, calibrate and cross-validate the algorithms; to use extant plasma samples from patients in a PEPFAR-funded HIV care program to design and cross-validate a new diagnostic algorithm that includes implementation of pooled assays; and to develop usable software that will enable programs to design their own protocols based on the characteristics of their patient population and local capacity for viral load testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective use of antiretroviral therapy is critical for managing and preventing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This proposal develops methods that make optimal use of diagnostic tests having limited availability to monitor the effectiveness of therapy and to prompt a change in regimen when it is warranted. Successful implementation will improve patient outcomes and help to prevent the spread of treatment-resistant strains of HIV.            ",Optimizing HIV Treatment Monitoring under Resource Constraints,8847003,R01AI108441,"['Algorithms', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological Assay', 'Calibration', 'Canada', 'Caring', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Europe', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV therapy', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Individual', 'Kenya', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prevention therapy', 'Primary Health Care', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'response', 'simulation', 'software development', 'standard care', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NIAID,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,766672,127562714,0.18602849351462716
"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.            ",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8588785,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Hexamethylene Bisacetamide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Probability', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Virus', 'Vorinostat', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'drug mechanism', 'high standard', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'reactivation from latency', 'tool']",NIAID,J.

Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic in the US.                    ",mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM,8730278,K23MH102128,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Delphi Study', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genital system', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Preceptorship', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Network', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'demographics', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mobile application', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'young man']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2014,172292,178185562,0.2496986166706576
"Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM     DESCRIPTION: Surveillance estimates indicate an alarming resurgence of new HIV/AIDS cases among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), highlighting the importance of re-examining prevention modalities and behavior change strategies. After diagnosis, persons living with HIV continue to engage in sexual and drug use behaviors that increase the risk for transmission of HIV. By continuing to engage in unprotected sex, HIV+ YMSM put themselves at risk of transmitting HIV to their partners, becoming re-infected with another strain of HIV, and/or acquiring other STIs. Individuals who communicate with sex partners about condom use and sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, have been found to be more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. However, disclosure represents a challenging situation which is a universal and recurrent stressor in the lives of HIV+ persons. Despite being recognized as a critical component of prevention interventions directed at MSM, there is currently no stand-alone, easily delivered disclosure intervention. Moreover, there is a need to design interventions that engage the targeted population without the requirement of extensive training of facilitators who traditionally provide in person role plays, a method that will always e limited by lack of availability and scalability. Developing an ecologically relevant, artificially intelligent (AI) technology tool to offer the opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill implementation, in a safe and engaging manner, is highly innovative, relevant and needed. This tool would be able to address the context (e.g., the emotionally charged experience of disclosure), content (the highly stigmatizing nature of an HIV diagnosis), and possible consequences (both positive and negative). Such a tool offers the added benefit of constant availability for the user to practice and receive feedback for each trial of practice while providig the possibility of a rewarding and reinforcing technology that shapes targeted behaviors to be more effective. The central goal of this proposal, titled, ""Tough Talks: A disclosure intervention for HIV+ YMSM,"" is to create a safe, internet-delivered software program that will offer intelligen virtual character-driven scenarios that are engaging, interactive, ecologically sensitive, and user-centric in content and design, all focused on increasing mastery of important skills associated with disclosure of HIV status. In Phase I, Tough Talks will be a novel prevention tool that will address sexual health communication with sex partners in the context of addressing disclosure of HIV status. If this paradigm is successful, this intervention would represent a highl customizable solution that could be expanded to address HIV disclosure among MSM to family and friends or adapted to deal with disclosure among other HIV infected populations or for other contagious and/or stigmatizing conditions where disclosure is challenging.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reducing sexual risk among HIV-infected YMSM, the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidence, begins with negotiation of safer sex behaviors with current and potential sex partners. Individuals who can communicate with sex partners about sexual health topics, including disclosure of HIV status, are more likely to engage in condom use behaviors. Therefore, HIV status disclosure represents an important underdeveloped public health strategy to address ongoing sexual risk behaviors. Despite being recognized as a critical component of prevention interventions, there is currently no stand-alone, easily delivered HIV disclosure intervention. Developing an ecologically relevant, artificially intelligent (AI) technology tool to offer the opportunity for knowledge acquisition and skill implementation as it relates to disclosure of HIS status, in a safe and engaging manner, is highly innovative, relevant and needed. Tough Talks will be a novel and high impact prevention tool to address sexual health communication with sex partners in the context of disclosing HIV status.                ",Tough Talks: A Disclosure Intervention for HIV+ YMSM,8731751,R43MH104102,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disclosure', 'Drug usage', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Professional', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Readiness', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Partners', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Unsafe Sex', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior change', 'condoms', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'safer sex', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'skills', 'stressor', 'successful intervention', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"VIRTUALLY BETTER, INC.",R43,2014,349999,0,0.3374594903000626
"HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to determine if associations exist between the contexts in which people obtain healthcare (i.e., healthcare context) or live (i.e., residential context) and each of five outcomes (HIV testing, receipt of tes results, linkage to HIV/AIDS care, retention in HIV care and HIV viral load). The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS among racial/ethnic minorities (specifically, Blacks and Latinos) and older adults (i.e., 50 and older) suggests they may encounter barriers that contribute to disparities in early detection of HIV and in their prognoses. Hence, we will also examine disparities in the outcomes by race/ethnicity and older age (age >50).  Drawing on the socio-behavioral sciences, the study will inform clinical practice in ways that promote equity in care across diverse groups, neighborhood conditions and stages of adulthood. The study's primary Specific Aims are to: (1) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and HIV testing during primary care visits using logistic regression multilevel models with random effects based on primary care patients' electronic medical records; and, (2) Examine relations between healthcare context, residential context and receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care, respectively, among managed care enrollees newly diagnosed as HIV-positive using multilevel logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The secondary Specific Aim is to determine if racial/ethnic- or age-related (i.e., aged <50 vs. >50 years) disparities exist in these relationships.  Building on our work on HIV testing and care, and guided by a model integrating the Public Health Critical Race Praxis and Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization, the four-year study based on the electronic medical records (EMRs) of adults enrolled in the largest managed care organization in the region. We will pool data over five years (2007-2011) to examine HIV testing among all patients presenting for primary care, and to examine receipt of HIV test results, linkage to and retention in HIV/AIDS care as well as HIV viral load among all patients newly diagnosed as HIV-positive. The study will comprise four multilevel analyses of patients' residential contexts (e.g., neighborhood HIV prevalence) and healthcare contexts (e.g., characteristics of the patient population) relative to HIV testing durin primary care visits (Aim 1), receipt of HIV test results and linkage to HIV/AIDS care among those diagnosed as HIV-positive (Aim 2), retention in HIV/AIDS care and HIV RNA viral load up to one-year post diagnosis. We will use personal and geospatial codes in the EMRs to link to: (1) files containing detailed information on each provider (e.g., demographics, specialty); (2) public data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on HIV prevalence and HIV test sites in each zip code; (3) 2010 Census socioeconomic data (e.g., concentrated poverty) for each zip code; and, (4) global positioning system software to calculate the distance from a patient's home to their provider. This interdisciplinary, inter- institutional collaboration leveraes the expertise of a diverse team of new and seasoned investigators.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to learn why adults, especially racial/ethnic minorities and older adults, who have insurance may nevertheless not receive HIV testing or HIV/AIDS care at the recommended levels. The study compares MCO enrollees based on their medical records, assigned providers and neighborhood social conditions to see if certain patients have a harder time getting testing or care because of the type of provider they see or because of where they live.                    ","HIV Testing, Linkage and Retention in Care: Contextual Factors and Disparities",8732429,R01NR014789,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Association Learning', 'Attitude', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV diagnosis', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Managed Care', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Site', 'Social Conditions', 'Staging', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'contextual factors', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'multilevel analysis', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'software systems', 'time use']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2014,413942,673201228,0.346498677112351
"The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) has the ability to enter a long-lived dormant state, termed proviral latency. Proviral latency is the primay barrier to eradication of HIV-1 from infected individuals, owing to viral reactivation from reservoirs of latently infected cells upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment. It is known tht HIV-1 transcription significantly influences the regulation of HIV-1 latency. The proposed research will utilize high-throughput single-cell measurements to quantify modulated HIV-1 gene expression. A combination of drug perturbations and mutations of cis regulatory elements within the promoter will be used to modulate gene expression and stability of the latent state. Modulations using both approaches will be characterized by high-throughput flow cytometry to measure HIV-1 gene-expression from an array of HIV-1 constructs expressing GFP. Diverse modulations of gene expression will be tested for their ability to reactivate latent HIV as a function of their transcriptional modulation, with the aim of using the data to develop a detailed mechanistic model of transcriptionally driven latency and reactivation. With a deeper mechanistic understanding of latency and the potential discovery of novel reactivating compounds, this research has applications to the fields of HIV, systems biology, and pharmaceutical sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The discovery of a cure for HIV is currently out of reach, hindered by the virus's ability to lay silent in a dormant state within the DNA of a human cell. This inactive or latent state reactivates at a later time, causing elevated levels of HIV, AIDS, an ultimately the death of an infected individual. By building on evidence that latency is heavily influenced by HIV-1 gene expression, this project aims to mechanistically understand how altering viral gene expression affects HIV latent stability using diverse biochemical approaches that modulate its expression and latent reactivation resulting in research of interests to the HIV and systems biology communities.            ",The Role of Transcriptional Noise in the Establishment of HIV-1 Latency,8467574,F32AI104380,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV-1', 'Hexamethylene Bisacetamide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Probability', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Virus', 'Vorinostat', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'drug mechanism', 'high standard', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'reactivation from latency', 'tool']",NIAID,J.

"Research Career Development in HIV-Related Anal Dysplasia/Carcinoma Prevention an The prevalence of anal carcinoma is greatly increased in HIV+ men (35 per 100,000) and HIV+ men who have sex with men (70 per 100,000) relative the general population (0.8 per 100,000). De- spite the need for effective anal carcinoma screening, the workload and costs involved prevent its wide- spread integration into routine HIV care.  The candidate is an Assistant Professor with a background of training in Infectious Disease and HIV clinical research. His long-term goal is to develop an HIV clinical research career focusing on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of HPV-related anal carcinoma. In his career development, the candidate will acquire didactic training through completion of a Master's of Clinical Research degree that will complement his prior training and aid in completing his research objectives. Practical experience will be gained through completion of the proposed research. The research objective is to develop a predictive model to identify patients with a high risk for progression of early anal dysplasia. The central hypothesis is that progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia is associated with environmental, virological, and host molecular factors including: smoking, viral load, viral oncogene expression, p53, p16'nk4a, and Ki67 ex- pression. Specific aims are to: 1) identify factors associated with progression from low-grade to high-grade anal dysplasia and 2) to develop a statistical model to predict this progression using logistic regression and classification and regression tree analysis. These aims will be accomplished using a prospective observa- tional study of patients with low grade dysplasia. Environmental, virological, and molecular factors will be assessed at baseline with follow-up at 6 month intervals to assess for progression. This project is expected to have a positive impact on public health by improving the cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening, identifying a population that may benefit from early treatment interventions, and providing information appli- cable to the screening and treatment of other HPV-related cancers.  The rationale is that the proposed research will provide the candidate with research skills, a background in HPV research, a publication record in HPV, and information that will form the basis for his ap- plication for independent R01 funding. The candidate is well positioned to capitalize on a K Award based on his prior training and research experience, a team of highly qualified mentors with expertise in epidemiology and HPV-related carcinogenesis, and the commitment of a supportive institutional environment with other funded researchers doing complementary research. n/a",Research Career Development in HIV-Related Anal Dysplasia/Carcinoma Prevention an,8318836,K23AI080202,"['Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Anal carcinoma', 'Anus', 'Award', 'Capital', 'Carcinoma', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical dysplasia', 'Cervix carcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Cytology', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Hygiene', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pneumocystis', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Radiation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Oncogene', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'meetings', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mortality', 'neoplastic', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'skills', 'tocol', 'training aid', 'treatment strategy', 'vaccine efficacy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,K23,2012,115450,88720000,0.19355222064546562
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Summary The purpose of this community-based evaluation study is to pilot test the feasibility of expanding pharmacy services to include provision of HIV testing referrals and services to injection drug users (IDUs) who purchase syringes in pharmacies in the Harlem community of New York City. In 2001, New York State pharmacies were allowed to register to sell syringes without a prescription through the Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program (ESAP), a public health policy targeted to IDUs to reduce syringe sharing and subsequent HIV transmission. This proposed evaluation study is based on two observations: black and Hispanic IDUs are disproportionately affected by HIV, and some pharmacists support ESAP and consider their work to include public health practice. Given our research team's extensive research in evaluating pharmacy syringe access, we believe that extending services, such as HIV testing, is a logical next step in the effort to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Thus, the specific aims are: (1) to pilot test the feasibility of 10 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the delivery of HIV testing referrals to local HIV testing sites among IDU-syringe customers; and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of offering and performing HIV counseling and testing to IDU syringe-purchasing customers in 2 additional pilot pharmacies. To accomplish these aims, 10 pharmacies from the Harlem community will be randomly selected from 100 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the Harlem area. In collaboration with community members and local pharmacists, the research team will utilize a previously developed training module for pharmacists and pharmacy staff on the availability of HIV testing services, and how to engage/offer referrals to IDU syringe customers. IDUs who receive services from the pilot pharmacies will be asked to participate in a brief structured survey administered at the pharmacy by research staff. Among approximately 362 IDUs, we will compare those who have used the HIV testing referral vs. those who did not with respect to demographics, drug and sexual risk behaviors, perceptions and attitudes toward HIV testing, prior HIV testing, and previous HIV-positive diagnosis (Aim 1). We will also select and train pharmacy staff at 2 additional pilot pharmacies to perform HIV counseling and testing on-site (Aim 2); among IDUs who are offered on-site testing (N=82), we will administer a brief structured survey to compare those who agree to be tested vs. those who refuse with respect to similar factors described in Aim 1. Finally, semi-structured questionnaires will be administered to all pharmacy staff to qualitatively ascertain the impact of expanded services on customer base, daily business flow, and attitudes and perceptions of HIV testing services (referrals or on-site) among IDUs. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression will be used to analyze quantitative IDU data and standard qualitative techniques will be used to analyze pharmacy staff data. This proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV testing that can reach high risk black and Hispanic communities in New York City. Due to a recently implemented expanded syringe access program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription, a natural next step is to explore linking additional services, namely HIV testing referrals and on-site HIV testing services, with syringe sales to IDUs. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only through-out other high risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other states with similar pharmacy access programs (e.g, New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Maine).           n/a","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative ",8307262,U01PS000698,[' '],NCHHSTP,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2011,81820,558628098,0.3153207674760054

"Prognostic Markers for HIV-Postive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to the PA-07-173 entitled Research on Malignancies in AIDS and Acquired Immune Suppression. HIV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is known to be clinically more aggressive and less responsive to therapy compared to non HIV-related DLBCL. In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related DLBCL is no longer invariably fatal and is heterogeneous in clinical outcomes. Despite the availability of potentially effective regimens for the treatment of DLBCL, more than 50% of patients continue to succumb to the disease. Therefore, understanding factors underlying HIV-related DLBCL aggressiveness and heterogeneity is critical to risk- stratified patient management and novel therapeutic development. Although clinical factors (e.g., tumor stage) are predictive for HIV-related DLBCL outcomes in the ART era, they fail to accurately predict outcome for a sizeable portion of cases and provide little therapeutic insight. Yet, knowledge on biologic factors predisposing HIV-related DLBCL prognosis is scarce. The broad objective of this study is therefore to investigate the prognostic significance of several viral and molecular factors for HIV-related DLBCL to advance clinical care and provide insight for new molecular therapeutic targets for DLBCL. The three main aims are: (1) to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor viral infection (EBV, KSHV) and several molecular agents (mutagenic molecules, cell cycle regulators, B-cell activation markers, and anti-apoptotic proteins) for HIV-related DLBCL prognosis; (2) to investigate the effect of HIV infection on viral/molecular pathogenesis in DLBCL prognosis; and (3) to build a prediction equation, incorporating both clinical factors and tumor markers, for predicting probability of disease progression for HIV-related DLBCL. The proposed study employs an observational cohort design and will include: (1) all incident HIV-related DLBCL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 (expected n=192), and (2) an age- gender- and diagnosis year-matched cohort of non HIV-related DLBCL cases. Patients will be identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California, which are integrated health care systems serving ~25% of insured Californians. Kaiser Permanente has long-standing HIV and cancer registries in addition to >80 administrative and clinical databases to perform these studies. This research will utilize archived tumor specimens available at Kaiser Permanente to assess tumor expression of selected markers via the construction of tissue microarrays and immunohistochemical staining. Patients will be followed for overall survival and disease progression through December 2009 by a standardized review of the medical records. Analytical techniques including survival analysis and logistic regression will be used to analyze data for the proposed aims. The proposed study will serve to identify tumor- related biologic factors affecting HIV-related DLBCL aggressiveness, and provide insights for novel molecular therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the study will provide a prediction equation for predicting DLBCL progression in HIV-infected patients, which will assist clinicians to evaluate both tumor characteristics and clinical factors when making therapeutic recommendations for patients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will contribute to the understanding of tumor-related biological factors underlying the HIV- related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma aggressiveness and heterogeneity in clinical outcomes.

"Research Career Development in HIV-Related Anal Dysplasia/Carcinoma Prevention an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of anal carcinoma is greatly increased in HIV+ men (35 per 100,000) and HIV+ men who have sex with men (70 per 100,000) relative the general population (0.8 per 100,000). De- spite the need for effective anal carcinoma screening, the workload and costs involved prevent its wide- spread integration into routine HIV care. The candidate is an Assistant Professor with a background of training in Infectious Disease and HIV clinical research. His long-term goal is to develop an HIV clinical research career focusing on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of HPV-related anal carcinoma. In his career development, the candidate will acquire didactic training through completion of a Master's of Clinical Research degree that will complement his prior training and aid in completing his research objectives. Practical experience will be gained through completion of the proposed research. The research objective is to develop a predictive model to identify patients with a high risk for progression of early anal dysplasia. The central hypothesis is that progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia is associated with environmental, virological, and host molecular factors including: smoking, viral load, viral oncogene expression, p53, p16'nk4a, and Ki67 expression. Specific aims are to: 1) identify factors associated with progression from low-grade to high-grade anal dysplasia and 2) to develop a statistical model to predict this progression using logistic regression and classification and regression tree analysis. These aims will be accomplished using a prospective observational study of patients with low grade dysplasia. Environmental, virological, and molecular factors will be assessed at baseline with follow-up at 6 month intervals to assess for progression. This project is expected to have a positive impact on public health by improving the cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening, identifying a population that may benefit from early treatment interventions, and providing information applicable to the screening and treatment of other HPV-related cancers. The rationale is that the proposed research will provide the candidate with research skills, a background in HPV research, a publication record in HPV, and information that will form the basis for his application for independent R01 funding.

"Prognostic Markers for HIV-Postive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to the PA-07-173 entitled Research on Malignancies in AIDS and Acquired Immune Suppression. HIV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is known to be clinically more aggressive and less responsive to therapy compared to non HIV-related DLBCL. In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related DLBCL is no longer invariably fatal and is heterogeneous in clinical outcomes. Despite the availability of potentially effective regimens for the treatment of DLBCL, more than 50% of patients continue to succumb to the disease. Therefore, understanding factors underlying HIV-related DLBCL aggressiveness and heterogeneity is critical to risk- stratified patient management and novel therapeutic development. Although clinical factors (e.g., tumor stage) are predictive for HIV-related DLBCL outcomes in the ART era, they fail to accurately predict outcome for a sizeable portion of cases and provide little therapeutic insight. Yet, knowledge on biologic factors predisposing HIV-related DLBCL prognosis is scarce. The broad objective of this study is therefore to investigate the prognostic significance of several viral and molecular factors for HIV-related DLBCL to advance clinical care and provide insight for new molecular therapeutic targets for DLBCL. The three main aims are: (1) to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor viral infection (EBV, KSHV) and several molecular agents (mutagenic molecules, cell cycle regulators, B-cell activation markers, and anti-apoptotic proteins) for HIV-related DLBCL prognosis; (2) to investigate the effect of HIV infection on viral/molecular pathogenesis in DLBCL prognosis; and (3) to build a prediction equation, incorporating both clinical factors and tumor markers, for predicting probability of disease progression for HIV-related DLBCL. The proposed study employs an observational cohort design and will include: (1) all incident HIV-related DLBCL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 (expected n=192), and (2) an age- gender- and diagnosis year-matched cohort of non HIV-related DLBCL cases.

"ART Availability and HIV-Related Stigma/Social Consequences in Rakai, Uganda    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Approximately 22 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa were HIV-infected in 2007. HIV-related stigma-""a process of devaluation of people ... with HIV/AIDS"" (UNAIDS)-has been documented worldwide, and is associated with depression, low self-esteem, and suboptimal treatment outcomes. HIV-related stigma has been described as an important cause of concealment of HIV status, inconsistent condom use, and low uptake and retention in treatment programs, compromising prevention and control efforts. The WHO has suggested that expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce stigma by changing perceptions about HIV. The proposed research evaluates this supposition in the Ugandan context: Since treatment rollout began, have stigma and negative social consequences of HIV diagnosis declined, and have they changed differentially for men and women? The specific aims are to assess the association between treatment access and 1) enacted stigma (discrimination), 2) disclosure of HIV serostatus to primary partner, and 3) marital dissolution. The proposed study utilizes data from the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) in southwestern Uganda. The study population includes an estimated 3,000 couples followed in 50 villages by the RHSP Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) between 2001-2008 and approximately 1,400 adults receiving ART from RHSP with funding from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The RHSP is an ideal setting to assess this important public health question, as provides rich sociodemographic, behavioral, and serologic data for a large representative community sample pre and post ART availability in rural Africa. Enacted stigma (Aim 1) is measured by questionnaire among adult HIV-clinic clients who have initiated ART. HIV sero-status disclosure (Aim 2) and marital dissolution (Aim 3) are assessed through annual RCCS questionnaires including time periods before and after ART, cross-checked between partner responses. Log binomial regression will be used to assess correlates of enacted stigma; results will be stratified by gender. Discrete-time survival analysis via pooled logistic regression will be used to examine the association between ART availability and HIV sero-status disclosure, as well as ART availability and marital dissolution. The proposed research will contribute to multiple CDC objectives described under ""Healthy People in a Healthy World"" and ""Healthy People in Every Stage of Life"". Findings on disclosure, martial dissolution, and enacted stigma in Rakai can be applied to reduce the impact of stigma on public health efforts to promote HIV testing, positive secondary prevention behaviors, and treatment utilization in a variety of settings. Ultimately, this research will contribute to the body of evidence supporting and guiding public health investments to improve psychosocial outcomes and quality of life for people living with HIV (Objective 25), increase HIV testing and sero-status disclosure, decrease HIV transmission through unprotected sexual intercourse (Objectives 7.1, 26, and 30), and improve uptake and retention in HIV treatment (Objective 24).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: More than 22 million Africans are living with HIV, and many studies have documented significant negative health impacts of perceived HIV-related stigma, including depression, low self-esteem, and suboptimal treatment outcomes. In order to overcome stigma as a barrier to healthcare utilization, adherence to antiretroviral medication, secondary prevention, sero-status disclosure, and social support, more evidence is needed on the relationship between treatment availability and stigma in African settings. This study will inform public health strategies to reduce the impact of stigma on prevention and health-seeking behaviors.           PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 22 million Africans are living with HIV, and many studies have documented significant negative health impacts of perceived HIV-related stigma, including depression, low self-esteem, and suboptimal treatment outcomes.

In 2001, New York State pharmacies were allowed to register to sell syringes without a prescription through the Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program (ESAP), a public health policy targeted to IDUs to reduce syringe sharing and subsequent HIV transmission. This proposed evaluation study is based on two observations: black and Hispanic IDUs are disproportionately affected by HIV, and some pharmacists support ESAP and consider their work to include public health practice. Given our research team's extensive research in evaluating pharmacy syringe access, we believe that extending services, such as HIV testing, is a logical next step in the effort to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Thus, the specific aims are: (1) to pilot test the feasibility of 10 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the delivery of HIV testing referrals to local HIV testing sites among IDU-syringe customers; and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of offering and performing HIV counseling and testing to IDU syringe-purchasing customers in 2 additional pilot pharmacies.

"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed. Sequence change in putative HLA restricted CTL epitopes in nef and env will be correlated with patient HLA type.

"Prognostic Markers for HIV-Postive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to the PA-07-173 entitled Research on Malignancies in AIDS and Acquired Immune Suppression. HIV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is known to be clinically more aggressive and less responsive to therapy compared to non HIV-related DLBCL. In the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related DLBCL is no longer invariably fatal and is heterogeneous in clinical outcomes. Despite the availability of potentially effective regimens for the treatment of DLBCL, more than 50% of patients continue to succumb to the disease. Therefore, understanding factors underlying HIV-related DLBCL aggressiveness and heterogeneity is critical to risk- stratified patient management and novel therapeutic development. Although clinical factors (e.g., tumor stage) are predictive for HIV-related DLBCL outcomes in the ART era, they fail to accurately predict outcome for a sizeable portion of cases and provide little therapeutic insight. Yet, knowledge on biologic factors predisposing HIV-related DLBCL prognosis is scarce. The broad objective of this study is therefore to investigate the prognostic significance of several viral and molecular factors for HIV-related DLBCL to advance clinical care and provide insight for new molecular therapeutic targets for DLBCL. The three main aims are: (1) to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor viral infection (EBV, KSHV) and several molecular agents (mutagenic molecules, cell cycle regulators, B-cell activation markers, and anti-apoptotic proteins) for HIV-related DLBCL prognosis; (2) to investigate the effect of HIV infection on viral/molecular pathogenesis in DLBCL prognosis; and (3) to build a prediction equation, incorporating both clinical factors and tumor markers, for predicting probability of disease progression for HIV-related DLBCL. The proposed study employs an observational cohort design and will include: (1) all incident HIV-related DLBCL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2006 (expected n=192), and (2) an age- gender- and diagnosis year-matched cohort of non HIV-related DLBCL cases. Patients will be identified from Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California, which are integrated health care systems serving ~25% of insured Californians. Kaiser Permanente has long-standing HIV and cancer registries in addition to >80 administrative and clinical databases to perform these studies. This research will utilize archived tumor specimens available at Kaiser Permanente to assess tumor expression of selected markers via the construction of tissue microarrays and immunohistochemical staining. Patients will be followed for overall survival and disease progression through December 2009 by a standardized review of the medical records. Analytical techniques including survival analysis and logistic regression will be used to analyze data for the proposed aims. The proposed study will serve to identify tumor- related biologic factors affecting HIV-related DLBCL aggressiveness, and provide insights for novel molecular therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the study will provide a prediction equation for predicting DLBCL progression in HIV-infected patients, which will assist clinicians to evaluate both tumor characteristics and clinical factors when making therapeutic recommendations for patients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will contribute to the understanding of tumor-related biological factors underlying the HIV- related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma aggressiveness and heterogeneity in clinical outcomes.

"Research Career Development in HIV-Related Anal Dysplasia/Carcinoma Prevention an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of anal carcinoma is greatly increased in HIV+ men (35 per 100,000) and HIV+ men who have sex with men (70 per 100,000) relative the general population (0.8 per 100,000). De- spite the need for effective anal carcinoma screening, the workload and costs involved prevent its wide- spread integration into routine HIV care. The candidate is an Assistant Professor with a background of training in Infectious Disease and HIV clinical research. His long-term goal is to develop an HIV clinical research career focusing on the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of HPV-related anal carcinoma. In his career development, the candidate will acquire didactic training through completion of a Master's of Clinical Research degree that will complement his prior training and aid in completing his research objectives. Practical experience will be gained through completion of the proposed research. The research objective is to develop a predictive model to identify patients with a high risk for progression of early anal dysplasia. The central hypothesis is that progression from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia is associated with environmental, virological, and host molecular factors including: smoking, viral load, viral oncogene expression, p53, p16'nk4a, and Ki67 expression. Specific aims are to: 1) identify factors associated with progression from low-grade to high-grade anal dysplasia and 2) to develop a statistical model to predict this progression using logistic regression and classification and regression tree analysis. These aims will be accomplished using a prospective observational study of patients with low grade dysplasia. Environmental, virological, and molecular factors will be assessed at baseline with follow-up at 6 month intervals to assess for progression. This project is expected to have a positive impact on public health by improving the cost-effectiveness of anal dysplasia screening, identifying a population that may benefit from early treatment interventions, and providing information applicable to the screening and treatment of other HPV-related cancers. The rationale is that the proposed research will provide the candidate with research skills, a background in HPV research, a publication record in HPV, and information that will form the basis for his application for independent R01 funding. The candidate is well positioned to capitalize on a K Award based on his prior training and research experience, a team of highly qualified mentors with expertise in epidemiology and HPV-related carcinogenesis, and the commitment of a supportive institutional environment with other funded researchers doing complementary research.           n/a",Research Career Development in HIV-Related Anal Dysplasia/Carcinoma Prevention an,7555115,K23AI080202,"['Anal Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Anal carcinoma', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Anus', 'Award', 'Capital', 'Carcinoma', 'Caring', 'Cervical', 'Cervical dysplasia', 'Cervix carcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Cytology', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease regression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Hygiene', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Radiation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Statistical Models', 'Survival Rate', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Oncogene', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'mortality', 'neoplastic', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'skills', 'tocol', 'training aid', 'vaccine efficacy']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,K23,2008,113586,88720000,0.1939196617945709
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Summary The purpose of this community-based evaluation study is to pilot test the feasibility of expanding pharmacy services to include provision of HIV testing referrals and services to injection drug users (IDUs) who purchase syringes in pharmacies in the Harlem community of New York City. In 2001, New York State pharmacies were allowed to register to sell syringes without a prescription through the Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program (ESAP), a public health policy targeted to IDUs to reduce syringe sharing and subsequent HIV transmission. This proposed evaluation study is based on two observations: black and Hispanic IDUs are disproportionately affected by HIV, and some pharmacists support ESAP and consider their work to include public health practice. Given our research team's extensive research in evaluating pharmacy syringe access, we believe that extending services, such as HIV testing, is a logical next step in the effort to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Thus, the specific aims are: (1) to pilot test the feasibility of 10 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the delivery of HIV testing referrals to local HIV testing sites among IDU-syringe customers; and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of offering and performing HIV counseling and testing to IDU syringe-purchasing customers in 2 additional pilot pharmacies. To accomplish these aims, 10 pharmacies from the Harlem community will be randomly selected from 100 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the Harlem area. In collaboration with community members and local pharmacists, the research team will utilize a previously developed training module for pharmacists and pharmacy staff on the availability of HIV testing services, and how to engage/offer referrals to IDU syringe customers. IDUs who receive services from the pilot pharmacies will be asked to participate in a brief structured survey administered at the pharmacy by research staff. Among approximately 362 IDUs, we will compare those who have used the HIV testing referral vs. those who did not with respect to demographics, drug and sexual risk behaviors, perceptions and attitudes toward HIV testing, prior HIV testing, and previous HIV-positive diagnosis (Aim 1). We will also select and train pharmacy staff at 2 additional pilot pharmacies to perform HIV counseling and testing on-site (Aim 2); among IDUs who are offered on-site testing (N=82), we will administer a brief structured survey to compare those who agree to be tested vs. those who refuse with respect to similar factors described in Aim 1. Finally, semi-structured questionnaires will be administered to all pharmacy staff to qualitatively ascertain the impact of expanded services on customer base, daily business flow, and attitudes and perceptions of HIV testing services (referrals or on-site) among IDUs. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression will be used to analyze quantitative IDU data and standard qualitative techniques will be used to analyze pharmacy staff data. This proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV testing that can reach high risk black and Hispanic communities in New York City. Due to a recently implemented expanded syringe access program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription, a natural next step is to explore linking additional services, namely HIV testing referrals and on-site HIV testing services, with syringe sales to IDUs.

"Brief Intervention to Reduce STDs in ER Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Barriers to health care utilization limit drug users' interaction with the primary health care system, resulting in episodic health care received through Emergency Departments (ED) and Urgent Care Centers (UCC). Since 1994, the BMC ED and UCC have provided substance abuse screening as standard of care. This program employs the Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) to assess readiness to change and offer intervention alternatives and referrals to substance abusing patients. Drug users' high rates of STDs, HIV, and Hepatitis C (HCV) and utilization of EDs and UCCs as usual sources of health care support the introduction of sexual behavior intervention in the ED and UCC setting. The proposed study will apply existing BNI theory and research to a new behavioral context. The proposed project is a collaborative effort to adapt the BNI to encourage safe sex behaviors to prevent gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV among male and female ED and UCC patients age 18-44 years who use heroin and/or crack/cocaine and are not in treatment. We will enroll and 1:1 randomize 3,340 patients to intervention (safe sex BNI) or control (standard counseling) over a 2.5-year period, with 6- month and 12-month follow-up. Enrollment will begin Month 9 of Year 1 and Follow-Up will be completed Month 3 of Year 5. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of safe sex BNI counseling to prevent STDs and HIV by comparing cumulative STD incidence and frequency of safe sex behavior between intervention and standard counseling (control) groups over a one year follow-up period. STD and HIV will be diagnosed by specific laboratory assay at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. Sexual and drug using behavior will be by participant self-report at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up, with biochemical testing of hair samples for opiates and cocaine at enrollment and 12-month follow-up. Sexual behavior risk will be measured in terms of proportion of vaginal and anal sex acts protected by condom use and condom use at last sexual act, by sexual partner type. Stage of change will be assessed by the Readiness Ruler. Differences in cumulative incidence between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using Poisson regression with random effects modeling if needed. Differences in safe sex behavior between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression. After assessing intervention effect in the base model, we will assess intervention effect controlling for age, gender, race, and baseline readiness to change and sexual and drug using behavior. We will conduct exploratory analyses for the potential interaction and mediating effects between intervention status and abstinence from drug use on incidence of STDs and self-reported behaviors. An effective, brief intervention for safe sex behaviors to reduce STDs and HIV among drug users in ED and UCC settings may provide a sustainable intervention opportunity for drug users who are otherwise difficult to access.            n/a",Brief Intervention to Reduce STDs in ER Drug Users,7390769,R01DA017061,"['AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anal Sex', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Chlamydia', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease regression', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gonorrhea', 'HIV', 'Hair', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heroin', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Opiates', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Route', 'Safe Sex', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vagina', 'base', 'condoms', 'drug standard', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'male', 'mecarzole', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'self reported behavior', 'theories']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2008,462119,61416950,0.10946222805853516

This proposed evaluation study is based on two observations: black and Hispanic IDUs are disproportionately affected by HIV, and some pharmacists support ESAP and consider their work to include public health practice. Given our research team's extensive research in evaluating pharmacy syringe access, we believe that extending services, such as HIV testing, is a logical next step in the effort to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Thus, the specific aims are: (1) to pilot test the feasibility of 10 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the delivery of HIV testing referrals to local HIV testing sites among IDU-syringe customers; and (2) to evaluate the feasibility of offering and performing HIV counseling and testing to IDU syringe-purchasing customers in 2 additional pilot pharmacies. To accomplish these aims, 10 pharmacies from the Harlem community will be randomly selected from 100 ESAP-registered pharmacies in the Harlem area. In collaboration with community members and local pharmacists, the research team will utilize a previously developed training module for pharmacists and pharmacy staff on the availability of HIV testing services, and how to engage/offer referrals to IDU syringe customers. IDUs who receive services from the pilot pharmacies will be asked to participate in a brief structured survey administered at the pharmacy by research staff. Among approximately 362 IDUs, we will compare those who have used the HIV testing referral vs. those who did not with respect to demographics, drug and sexual risk behaviors, perceptions and attitudes toward HIV testing, prior HIV testing, and previous HIV-positive diagnosis (Aim 1). We will also select and train pharmacy staff at 2 additional pilot pharmacies to perform HIV counseling and testing on-site (Aim 2); among IDUs who are offered on-site testing (N=82), we will administer a brief structured survey to compare those who agree to be tested vs. those who refuse with respect to similar factors described in Aim 1. Finally, semi-structured questionnaires will be administered to all pharmacy staff to qualitatively ascertain the impact of expanded services on customer base, daily business flow, and attitudes and perceptions of HIV testing services (referrals or on-site) among IDUs. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression will be used to analyze quantitative IDU data and standard qualitative techniques will be used to analyze pharmacy staff data. This proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore new venues for HIV testing that can reach high risk black and Hispanic communities in New York City. Due to a recently implemented expanded syringe access program allowing pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription, a natural next step is to explore linking additional services, namely HIV testing referrals and on-site HIV testing services, with syringe sales to IDUs. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only through-out other high risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other states with similar pharmacy access programs (e.g, New Jersey, California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Maine).           n/a","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative",7393585,U01PS000698,[' '],NCHHSTP,NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE,U01,2007,229223,0,0.3153207674760054
"HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs early after infection. Viral adaptation to replication in the CNS and its immunologic sequelae results in clinical neuropathological sequelae in up to 50% of untreated patients. Both host and viral determinants may mediate the neuropathology that results in the clinical syndromes of HIV associated dementia (HIV-D) and minor motor cognitive disorder (MMCD). In this study, we will examine the rate and possible determinants of evolution of HIV-1 in the CNS through 3 specific aims. SA 1: HIV-1 gp160 and nef sequence evolution will be assessed by comparing plasma and CSF virus in untreated patients identified in primary infection that are followed over 3 to 5 years employing rapid and sensitive screening of length polymorphism in V1-2 A/4-5 of env and clonal sequence analysis of env and nef. Concurrently, blood and CSF virus comparisons will be performed on longitudinal samples from a cohort of patients with chronic infection over a 3 to 5 year period to provide. Where differences are found, machine learning algorithms and multiple regression analysis will be performed to identify individual positions that contribute to sequence evolution with attention to glycosylation sites that alter neutralization by antibody, V3 positions that affect tropism or putative neurotoxicity, and CTL epitopes described in both env and nef. SA 2: In well characterized autopsy samples, CSF, plasma, parenchymal brain regions, spleen, lymph node and colon will be examined for proviral DNA sequences and RNA sequences, in order to characterize the composition of the HIV population in CNS and to determine the subset of viral variants that are productively replicating. SA 3: Prototypical env sequences identified in SA 1 and 2 will be cloned into expression vectors and co- receptor density dependence and usage and antibody neutralization susceptibility will be assessed. Sequence change in putative HLA restricted CTL epitopes in nef and env will be correlated with patient HLA type. Together, these studies will begin to identify and characterize immunologic determinants of HIV evolution in the CNS.         n/a",HIV-1 Adaptation in the Central Nervous System,7260356,R01NS051132,"['AIDS Dementia Complex', 'AIDS neuropathy', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Formation', 'Archives', 'Attention', 'Autologous', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CCR5 gene', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Colon', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Genus Cola', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Length', 'Lung', 'Lymphoid', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rate', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tropism', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'base', 'cohort', 'expression vector', 'genetic evolution', 'glycosylation', 'gp160', 'latent infection', 'lymph nodes', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'motor disorder', 'neuroadaptation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuropathology', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutralizing antibody', 'novel', 'programs', 'prospective', 'receptor', 'receptor density', 'recombinant virus', 'relating to nervous system', 'viral RNA']",NINDS,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2007,365406,41443271,0.28556509347032333
"Brief Intervention to Reduce STDs in ER Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Barriers to health care utilization limit drug users' interaction with the primary health care system, resulting in episodic health care received through Emergency Departments (ED) and Urgent Care Centers (UCC). Since 1994, the BMC ED and UCC have provided substance abuse screening as standard of care. This program employs the Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) to assess readiness to change and offer intervention alternatives and referrals to substance abusing patients. Drug users' high rates of STDs, HIV, and Hepatitis C (HCV) and utilization of EDs and UCCs as usual sources of health care support the introduction of sexual behavior intervention in the ED and UCC setting. The proposed study will apply existing BNI theory and research to a new behavioral context. The proposed project is a collaborative effort to adapt the BNI to encourage safe sex behaviors to prevent gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV among male and female ED and UCC patients age 18-44 years who use heroin and/or crack/cocaine and are not in treatment. We will enroll and 1:1 randomize 3,340 patients to intervention (safe sex BNI) or control (standard counseling) over a 2.5-year period, with 6- month and 12-month follow-up. Enrollment will begin Month 9 of Year 1 and Follow-Up will be completed Month 3 of Year 5. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of safe sex BNI counseling to prevent STDs and HIV by comparing cumulative STD incidence and frequency of safe sex behavior between intervention and standard counseling (control) groups over a one year follow-up period. STD and HIV will be diagnosed by specific laboratory assay at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. Sexual and drug using behavior will be by participant self-report at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up, with biochemical testing of hair samples for opiates and cocaine at enrollment and 12-month follow-up. Sexual behavior risk will be measured in terms of proportion of vaginal and anal sex acts protected by condom use and condom use at last sexual act, by sexual partner type. Stage of change will be assessed by the Readiness Ruler. Differences in cumulative incidence between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using Poisson regression with random effects modeling if needed. Differences in safe sex behavior between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression. After assessing intervention effect in the base model, we will assess intervention effect controlling for age, gender, race, and baseline readiness to change and sexual and drug using behavior. We will conduct exploratory analyses for the potential interaction and mediating effects between intervention status and abstinence from drug use on incidence of STDs and self-reported behaviors. An effective, brief intervention for safe sex behaviors to reduce STDs and HIV among drug users in ED and UCC settings may provide a sustainable intervention opportunity for drug users who are otherwise difficult to access.            n/a",Brief Intervention to Reduce STDs in ER Drug Users,7185164,R01DA017061,"['AIDS prevention', 'Abstinence', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Anal Sex', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Caring', 'Chlamydia', 'Clinic', 'Cocaine', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Crack Cocaine', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease regression', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Enrollment', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gonorrhea', 'HIV', 'Hair', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heroin', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Opiates', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Route', 'Safe Sex', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual Partners', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vagina', 'base', 'condoms', 'drug standard', 'early /brief intervention /therapy', 'follow-up', 'health care service utilization', 'male', 'mecarzole', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'self reported behavior', 'theories']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2007,522694,61416950,0.10946222805853516
"Anal Dysplasia in HIV+ and HIV- men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of anal carcinoma among HIV positive men is 70/100,000 person years. This is higher than the rate of cervical carcinoma prior to the onset of routine cytology screening. Anal squamous intra-epithelial lesions (ASIL) are pre-malignant lesions that can be found by screening cytology analogous to cervical dysplasia. It is felt that persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important cofactor for development of anal carcinoma. Prior to the routine use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, screening for anal dysplasia was studied in large cohorts of predominantly white HIV+ and HIV- men who have sex with men. High rates of ASIL and anal infection with HPV were found. It is not clear how this applies to other groups of HIV+ men including minorities, heterosexual men, and intravenous drug users, and how the rate of HPV and anal dysplasia may have changed after widespread use of HAART. This study will enroll 350 HIV+ men and 200 HIV- men who are 40% Hispanic and 40% African-American. Forty percent of the HIV+ men will report intravenous drug use or sex with women as their risk behavior for HIV. A standardized questionnaire will be administered to determine past sexual behaviors. Each participant will undergo anal cytology and anal HPV testing. Those individuals with oncogenic HPV at the first test will be followed with anal cytology and HPV testing every six months for a total of two years or five exams. Each participant with abnormal cytology will undergo high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy. Factors associated with prevalent ASIL and HPV infection including immunologic and sexual parameters will be compared using logistic regression. Persistence of HPV will be defined as the time to the first negative test for HPV and will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Factors associated with persistence will be included in a multiple Cox model. The influence of HAART will be assessed in both the prevalence and prospective components by including a term in the multiple models for length of time on anti-retroviral therapy with suppression of HIV. This study will help provide important new information on which groups of HIV+ men may benefit from screening and how HAART may modify this risk.   n/a",Anal Dysplasia in HIV+ and HIV- men,7114433,K23AI055038,"['AIDS therapy', 'HIV infections', 'antiAIDS agent', 'biopsy', 'combination chemotherapy', 'cytology', 'gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', 'human papillomavirus', 'human subject', 'male', 'mass screening', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'patient oriented research', 'rectum neoplasms', 'sex behavior']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLLEGE OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2006,130680,0,0.28590513850998567

Drug users' high rates of STDs, HIV, and Hepatitis C (HCV) and utilization of EDs and UCCs as usual sources of health care support the introduction of sexual behavior intervention in the ED and UCC setting. The proposed study will apply existing BNI theory and research to a new behavioral context. The proposed project is a collaborative effort to adapt the BNI to encourage safe sex behaviors to prevent gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV among male and female ED and UCC patients age 18-44 years who use heroin and/or crack/cocaine and are not in treatment. We will enroll and 1:1 randomize 3,340 patients to intervention (safe sex BNI) or control (standard counseling) over a 2.5-year period, with 6- month and 12-month follow-up. Enrollment will begin Month 9 of Year 1 and Follow-Up will be completed Month 3 of Year 5. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness of safe sex BNI counseling to prevent STDs and HIV by comparing cumulative STD incidence and frequency of safe sex behavior between intervention and standard counseling (control) groups over a one year follow-up period. STD and HIV will be diagnosed by specific laboratory assay at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up. Sexual and drug using behavior will be by participant self-report at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up, with biochemical testing of hair samples for opiates and cocaine at enrollment and 12-month follow-up. Sexual behavior risk will be measured in terms of proportion of vaginal and anal sex acts protected by condom use and condom use at last sexual act, by sexual partner type. Stage of change will be assessed by the Readiness Ruler. Differences in cumulative incidence between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using Poisson regression with random effects modeling if needed. Differences in safe sex behavior between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression. After assessing intervention effect in the base model, we will assess intervention effect controlling for age, gender, race, and baseline readiness to change and sexual and drug using behavior. We will conduct exploratory analyses for the potential interaction and mediating effects between intervention status and abstinence from drug use on incidence of STDs and self-reported behaviors. An effective, brief intervention for safe sex behaviors to reduce STDs and HIV among drug users in ED and UCC settings may provide a sustainable intervention opportunity for drug users who are otherwise difficult to access.            n/a",Brief Intervention to Reduce STDs in ER Drug Users,6797640,R01DA017061,"['AIDS education /prevention', 'HIV infections', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'chlamydial disease', 'clinical research', 'cocaine', 'communicable disease control', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'counseling', 'drug abuse', 'drug detection', 'emergency care', 'gonorrhea', 'heroin', 'high risk behavior /lifestyle', 'hospitals', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interview', 'longitudinal human study', 'medically underserved population', 'motivation', 'opiate alkaloid', 'patient oriented research', 'safe sex /sex abstinence', 'sex behavior', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2004,493390,61416950,0.10946222805853516
"HIV BEHAVIORS IN INJECTING AND NONINJECTING DRUG USERS Proposed is a prospective dynamic cohort to determine the prevalence and         incidence of HIV in recently initiated adolescent and young adult                injection drug users or initiates, and adolescent and young adult                noninjection drug users or NlUs (heroin/cocaine sniffers, crack smokers)         and to identify correlates and risk factors of HIV infection which               include newly examined factors in the presence of previously identified          HIV risk behaviors.  For this proposal, the ""new"" variables will include         physical/sexual abuse, psychiatric condition, social networks/social             support; the established variables include demographics, drug use and            sex practices, and circumstances of initiation into injecting Eligible           initiates must be between the ages of 15-30 and have initiated injection         drug use with the past 5 years.  Eligible NIUs must also be between the          ages of 15-30 and have used drugs (snort heroin/cocaine or smoke crack)          between 1 and 10 years prior to enrollment.  The 400 young initiates and         200 young NIUs will be recruited using street outreach methodology which         will involve a stationary clinic and mobile clinic for screening,                interviewing, testing and follow-up in the Greater Baltimore City area.          This dynamic cohort recruited and enrolled over a 5-year study period            will undergo baseline, 6, and 12-month interviews along with HIV testing         of all eligible participants of whom moderate remunerations will be              given.  Blood drawn on all participants will be screened for HIV using           ELISA and Western Blot assays, and stored in a repository for later              testing of other blood-borne pathogens.  In addition to the HIV results,         other data collected during the interview will include the above                 mentioned ""established"" correlates and ""new"" correlates (e.g.,                   physical/sexual abuse, psychiatric condition and social network/social           support).  The above correlates will be compared and contrasted among            initiates and NlUs.  A transition rate (from noninjection to injection           drug use) by the above covariates will also be estimated.  The analysis          will include a cross-sectional assessment of baseline data using                 univariate and bivariate approaches such as 2x2 and 2xK tables confirmed         with Mantel-Haenszel techniques.  Multivariate analysis will use                 logistic regression and regression tree techniques.

"Anal Dysplasia in HIV+ and HIV- men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rate of anal carcinoma among HIV positive men is 70/100,000 person years. This is higher than the rate of cervical carcinoma prior to the onset of routine cytology screening. Anal squamous intra-epithelial lesions (ASIL) are pre-malignant lesions that can be found by screening cytology analogous to cervical dysplasia. It is felt that persistent infection with oncogenic subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important cofactor for development of anal carcinoma. Prior to the routine use of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, screening for anal dysplasia was studied in large cohorts of predominantly white HIV+ and HIV- men who have sex with men. High rates of ASIL and anal infection with HPV were found. It is not clear how this applies to other groups of HIV+ men including minorities, heterosexual men, and intravenous drug users, and how the rate of HPV and anal dysplasia may have changed after widespread use of HAART. This study will enroll 350 HIV+ men and 200 HIV- men who are 40% Hispanic and 40% African-American. Forty percent of the HIV+ men will report intravenous drug use or sex with women as their risk behavior for HIV. A standardized questionnaire will be administered to determine past sexual behaviors. Each participant will undergo anal cytology and anal HPV testing. Those individuals with oncogenic HPV at the first test will be followed with anal cytology and HPV testing every six months for a total of two years or five exams. Each participant with abnormal cytology will undergo high-resolution anoscopy with biopsy. Factors associated with prevalent ASIL and HPV infection including immunologic and sexual parameters will be compared using logistic regression. Persistence of HPV will be defined as the time to the first negative test for HPV and will be analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Factors associated with persistence will be included in a multiple Cox model. The influence of HAART will be assessed in both the prevalence and prospective components by including a term in the multiple models for length of time on anti-retroviral therapy with suppression of HIV. This study will help provide important new information on which groups of HIV+ men may benefit from screening and how HAART may modify this risk.   n/a",Anal Dysplasia in HIV+ and HIV- men,6653058,K23AI055038,"['AIDS therapy', ' HIV infections', ' antiAIDS agent', ' biopsy', ' combination chemotherapy', ' cytology', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human papillomavirus', ' human subject', ' male', ' mass screening', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' patient oriented research', ' rectum neoplasms', ' sex behavior']",NIAID,WEILL MEDICAL COLLEGE OF CORNELL UNIV,K23,2003,130680,0,0.28590513850998567

"HIV BEHAVIORS IN INJECTING AND NONINJECTING DRUG USERS Proposed is a prospective dynamic cohort to determine the prevalence and         incidence of HIV in recently initiated adolescent and young adult                injection drug users or initiates, and adolescent and young adult                noninjection drug users or NlUs (heroin/cocaine sniffers, crack smokers)         and to identify correlates and risk factors of HIV infection which               include newly examined factors in the presence of previously identified          HIV risk behaviors.  For this proposal, the ""new"" variables will include         physical/sexual abuse, psychiatric condition, social networks/social             support; the established variables include demographics, drug use and            sex practices, and circumstances of initiation into injecting Eligible           initiates must be between the ages of 15-30 and have initiated injection         drug use with the past 5 years.  Eligible NIUs must also be between the          ages of 15-30 and have used drugs (snort heroin/cocaine or smoke crack)          between 1 and 10 years prior to enrollment.  The 400 young initiates and         200 young NIUs will be recruited using street outreach methodology which         will involve a stationary clinic and mobile clinic for screening,                interviewing, testing and follow-up in the Greater Baltimore City area.          This dynamic cohort recruited and enrolled over a 5-year study period            will undergo baseline, 6, and 12-month interviews along with HIV testing         of all eligible participants of whom moderate remunerations will be              given.  Blood drawn on all participants will be screened for HIV using           ELISA and Western Blot assays, and stored in a repository for later              testing of other blood-borne pathogens.  In addition to the HIV results,         other data collected during the interview will include the above                 mentioned ""established"" correlates and ""new"" correlates (e.g.,                   physical/sexual abuse, psychiatric condition and social network/social           support).  The above correlates will be compared and contrasted among            initiates and NlUs.  A transition rate (from noninjection to injection           drug use) by the above covariates will also be estimated.  The analysis          will include a cross-sectional assessment of baseline data using                 univariate and bivariate approaches such as 2x2 and 2xK tables confirmed         with Mantel-Haenszel techniques.  Multivariate analysis will use                 logistic regression and regression tree techniques.  Prospective data            on HIV incidence will use person-time techniques for univariate and              poisson regression for multivariate analyses Cox regression may also be          employed when examining transition rates by selected covariates.  We are         interested in identifying and clarifying the independent and joint               effects of the variables that relate to HIV infection and transition             into an injecting career in this population.  Our earlier initiate               studies have shown the period shortly after initiation into injection            drug use is associated with high risk of HIV infection, especially among         young IDUs and women.
