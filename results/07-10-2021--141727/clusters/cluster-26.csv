"A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates Most hospitalized infants experience painful procedures as a part of their care. Repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during early life is associated with permanent changes in brain structure and function and may lead to behavioral and developmental disabilities. Caregivers recognize the need to treat pain in infants but may be reluctant to administer analgesics because of potential short- and long-term side effects. Assessing pain in this vulnerable patient population is difficult as their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. This difficulty may lead to both over- and under-treatment of pain, placing infants at risk for permanent neurologic injury. We propose to develop models and computer algorithms to automatically and continuously assess pain in neonates based on behavioral and physiological pain indicators.  To achieve this goal, the proposal has two aims: aim 1- Continuously and synchronously record contextual, behavioral and physiological signals from neonates in the NICU while they are undergoing prolonged acute pain; aim 2 - developing a multimodal system for assessing postoperative pain in neonates. The proposed system would generate continuous and standardized pain scores comparable to those obtained by conventional nurse-derived pain scores. It would improve care outcomes by enhancing the assessment of pain while decreasing the burden of pain documentation. It can also eliminate issues of inter-rater reliability associated with conventional neonatal pain assessment. The proposed data collection plan was designed based on our preliminary results and statistical analysis. The proposed system will be evaluated using standard performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Cohen’s kappa coefficient, or their variations.  The interdisciplinary team includes a neonatologist, Dr. Ho, who is a faculty of both USF College of Medicine and College of Nursing. She practices and oversees the clinical research projects at the Tampa General Hospital NICU (the teaching hospital for USF Health). She ensures the team’s access to the NICU patient population for enrollment. She supervises the performance of the study including nursing pain assessment, video recording, and data collection. The team also includes a professor in nursing who specializes in neonatal opioids dependence and pain, an experienced research nurse, two computer science professors, and one statistics professor. The proposed work aligns very well with the NINR’s mission “to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.” The proposed neonatal pain assessment approach will provide a tool for nurses to assess pain continuously and more accurately. Pain is one of the critical factors affecting the brain development in neonates, especially in preterm neonates, with chronic illnesses. The incidence of perterm neonates exposed to pain in high and pain assessment and management remain a primary focus of neonatal nursing research. For infants in the NICU coping with pain, the proposed nursing research will enable proper pain treatment that will also improve their long-term outcomes and development. Project Narrative Hospitalized infants may experience hundreds of painful procedures, repeated or prolonged exposure to pain during this early developmental period is associated with permanent alterations in brain structure and function. Assessing pain in this vulnerable population of patients is difficult because their responses are nonspecific and vary based on developmental stage. In this application, the investigators propose to refine and evaluate a novel automated multimodal computer aided pain assessment tool to aid in reliable diagnosis and prompt treatment of pain leading to improved outcomes.",A Multimodal Approach for Monitoring Prolonged Acute Pain in Neonates,9979265,R21NR018756,"['Acute Pain', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Analgesics', 'Appearance', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Crying', 'Data Collection', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Nursing', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Research', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Assessment Tool', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain management', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Psychometrics', 'Reader', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'care burden', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'coping', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'multimodality', 'neonatal care', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pain score', 'patient population', 'preterm newborn', 'procedural pain', 'professor', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'side effect', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R21,2020,90877,86023662,0.3747942927118456
"Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP Project Summary Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a complex multi-factorial condition, as well as the most prevalent painful musculoskeletal disorder worldwide. Its causes and mechanisms are numerous and still poorly understood, which leads to common failure in its clinical treatment (e.g. physical therapy - PT). Systemic inflammation has been gaining attention in the literature as a likely contributing aspect to CLBP, but its causes are diverse and still lack thorough insight. One of these causes seems to be the presence of specific SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, the simplest and most common variation in human DNA) in certain genes that are known to be related to both inflammation and pain. It is unclear how these variations may affect the outcomes of different types of PT treatment for CLBP, which is an innovative aspect of the proposed research project. Overall, the main objective is to be able to better tailor specific PT treatment to each patient. More specifically, this research aims to understand if there is an association between gene variations and outcomes of PT treatment; it also intends to better understand the mechanisms behind how gene variations affect inflammation, to support the formation of novel research questions in the area of pain. Furthermore, it seeks to determine clinical sub- phenotypes of CLBP using machine learning (Network Phenotyping Strategy - NPS) based on patients’ responsiveness to PT treatment. From a career standpoint, it aims at supporting my professional development for a future in pain research and academia. The project will use genetic and clinical data from 200-250 patients, gathered from the 1000 patients’ cohort that the Pitt LB3P Mechanistic Research Center will collect; it will include all the patients with CLBP and no diagnosis of inflammatory or auto-immune disease who will undergo PT treatment as part of their standard of care within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). The data that will be used for this study includes the variations for selected genes, PT treatment (to be collected as a novel aspect facilitated by this proposed supplement), the outcomes variables (disability and pain scores, pain interference, the impression of change), as well as other clinically relevant information (e.g. age, sex, comorbidities). The analysis will be performed with two different approaches: first, it will be analyzed with the traditional statistical testing for genetic variations, to look for associations between SNPs and PT treatment outcomes. The analysis will include Logistic regression analysis for the association between genetic variations and outcome measures, Fisher's exact test for proper group determination, Cochran’s Q test for multiple groups if a non-paired assumption will be found to be more clinically relevant. Subsequently, the dataset will be analyzed using the NPS approach, which will help delineate clinical outcome-based phenotypes based on clinical response to PT treatment. By adding this new layer of information to the clinical approach, this research seeks to improve the assessment and treatment of CLBP in a PT setting and to make it more resource-efficient and tailored to each patient’s needs. Project Narrative Physical Therapy (PT) is one of the initial standards of care for the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP, a challenging condition that affects a large portion of the world population) but provides variable and overall unsatisfactory results. There are many possible contributing causes for CLBP, and one of them is systemic inflammation, which is partly regulated by genes, but to an unknown extent. This research intends to look into how variations in specific genes that are known to influence pain and inflammation may impact the outcomes of PT, to better inform the assessment and treatment patients with CLBP, and reduce the financial burden for the treatment of this condition.",Influence of inflammation-related genetic variants on PT treatment response in a population affected by CLBP,10208162,U19AR076725,"['Academia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Back Pain', 'Caring', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Failure', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Physical therapy', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Publications', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'diagnostic screening', 'disability', 'genetic variant', 'human DNA', 'impression', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'pain outcome', 'pain patient', 'pain score', 'patient response', 'physical therapist', 'predict clinical outcome', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'rehabilitation science', 'response', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U19,2020,100000,570146095,0.1908406247930675
"Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) PROJECT SUMMARY Analgesics are among the most commonly prescribed medications, and opioid painkillers are the gold standard for the management of severe acute pain, and for many chronic pain conditions. More than 30% of the U.S. population suffers from chronic pain, and nearly 40% of older adults report debilitating chronic pain conditions not caused by cancer. However, side effects of opioids, including tolerance, physical dependence, and respiratory depression have limited their effectiveness as pain killers. Rates of addiction and opioid overdose have escalated to a point of crisis. In the United States, on average approximately 115 people die every day from accidental overdose. Better, efficacious and safe opioid analgesic drugs with reduced risk of use are urgently needed. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO) – an integrated knowledgebase aimed at accelerating and improving the success of translational research and drug discovery programs towards the identification of efficacious and save opioid drugs. ODO will enable multi-tiered analyses across diverse data types and hypothesis development for example by connecting chemical structure, biochemical binding profiles, pharmacological responses in animals and drug side effects and thus enable more effective rational drug discovery programs. To develop ODO we will leverage our extensive previous work in several research consortia developing formal ontologies, data standards, processing and integration methods, and software systems to enable integrated access, query and analysis of large scale and diverse data types. The current proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the ODO integrated knowledgebase and illustrate proof of concept via two Specific Aims: (1) to curate and harmonize ODO content from diverse data sources via a semantic knowledge model enabling integration of diverse data types, and (2) to deploy the ODO integrated Data Portal and Search Engine engaging the community and demonstrate its heuristic value. We envision that the ODO will pave the way to enable advanced machine learning and link results from molecular simulations with opioid analgesic drug pharmacology and functional selectivity, thus facilitating, at larger scale, the rational, predictive design, and scaffold optimization in drug development efforts towards identifying safer opioid analgesics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pain is the number one reason people seek medical attention. Although narcotic pain killers are effective, they are highly addictive and have severe side effects. Doctors need better opioid drugs to treat moderate to severe pain. We propose to develop the Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO), the first public opioid drug knowledgebase with the capability to use machine learning tools to help scientists design new drugs to treat pain without harmful side effects.",Opioid Drug Ontology (ODO),9895053,R21DA048313,"['Acute Pain', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Analgesics', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'FAIR principles', 'Failure', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Narcotics', 'Network-based', 'Neuropharmacology', 'Ontology', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Opioid Receptor Binding', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Dependence', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publications', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'clinical pain', 'cloud based', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data harmonization', 'data portal', 'data standards', 'design', 'diverse data', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'medical attention', 'mu opioid receptors', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'search engine', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'software systems', 'structured data', 'success', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2020,230250,157845771,0.16218124156411737
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,10101757,R00DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'TMD treatment', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic painful condition', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinical pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'pain processing', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,246352,507546965,0.38681256546218457
"Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions PROJECT SUMMARY Opioid analgesics are commonly used to treat pain but have serious side effects, including addiction, dependence, and death from overdose. While there is a significant need for new non-addictive analgesics, efforts to develop new pain medicines have met with limited success. In part, this failure is due to an overreliance on evoked pain measures in preclinical models. Indeed, most preclinical models do not measure spontaneous pain—the main symptom of chronic pain in humans. To increase translational relevance, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was developed to quantify characteristic facial expressions associated with spontaneous pain. The MGS is reproducible across labs and was used to evaluate the efficacy of analgesics. However, the MGS has not been widely adopted due to its high resource demands and low throughput. To overcome this limitation, we adapted a machine learning model to classify the presence or absence of pain from mouse facial expressions. We called this model the automated Mouse Grimace Scale (aMGS). After training, this model identified mice in pain with 94% accuracy, comparable to a highly-trained human. However, our original “aMGS 1.0” is limited in several respects. It is only accurate at detecting facial grimacing in white- coated mice, and produces a binary assessment (“pain” vs. “no pain”) instead of a graded score. Moreover, aMGS 1.0 cannot dynamically determine pain status from full-motion videos. Additionally, we relied on an older piece of software that does not consistently extract high-quality images of the mouse face. The aMGS 1.0 also has difficulty distinguishing between images of sleeping and grimacing mice. Finally, aMGS 1.0 suffers from a “black box” problem inherent to most machine learning algorithms, in that we do not know what facial details it uses to produce a pain assessment. Here we propose to overcome all of these limitations by developing a more sophisticated version of our automated pain classifier (aMGS 2.0). To achieve this goal we will: 1) Develop and validate a new open-source platform to classify (frame-by-frame) spontaneous pain intensity from mouse facial expressions, using albino (white) mice and motion information. 2) Enhance the generality of aMGS 2.0 for use with black mice. And, 3) Develop a user-friendly web-based platform that operates on computer-based and mobile devices. We will validate the utility of aMGS with three pain assays that produce grimaces in rodents—inflammatory pain, post-surgical (laparotomy) pain, and neuropathic pain. To increase rigor and reproducibility, two pain assays will be performed and scored with aMGS 2.0 in an independent lab. Numerous investigators in the pain field have expressed interest in using our proposed model. The platform will include a cloud-based data repository and analytic tools to facilitate curation of public data, continuous improvement of the model over time, and integration of new analytic tools. One analytic tool that we plan to develop will identify mouse features that most influence pain classification. NARRATIVE As the opioid epidemic has made clear, there is significant need to develop new ways to study chronic pain and relief of pain in preclinical models. Development of an accurate and broadly useful machine learning model and web-based platform will make it possible for researchers to objectively quantify and study spontaneous pain in mice, and hence provide a way to more rapidly identify and validate new analgesic drugs.",Development of a deep neural network to measure spontaneous pain from mouse facial expressions,9866055,R01NS114259,"['Acetic Acids', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Animal Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Regions', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Database Management Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Pain', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Laparotomy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Reflex action', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Science', 'Screening procedure', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pain relief', 'cloud based', 'convolutional neural network', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'inflammatory pain', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'open source', 'opioid epidemic', 'overdose death', 'pain relief', 'painful neuropathy', 'persistent symptom', 'pre-clinical', 'recurrent neural network', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'spontaneous pain', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web services']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,364998,511185245,0.37546396802057386
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9856506,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'acute care', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical examination', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'ischemic injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,369672,570146095,0.17922561876894424
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment.

"PATHWAYS TO NEW BIOMARKERS IN RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN IN CHILDREN PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs; previously called Recurrent Abdominal Pain) affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. Up to 66% of children go on to have similar symptoms as adults. In children, the two most common FGIDs are functional abdominal pain (FAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS - essentially FAP with changes in stooling pattern). Management and treatment are hampered by lack of biomarkers to characterize and understand pathophysiologically what are phenotypically and arbitrarily defined conditions. Previous studies have evaluated IBS, not FAP, and relied primarily on retrospective symptom evaluation and utilized methodology (e.g., 16S sequencing) that limits in depth interrogation of perturbations (e.g., gut dysbiosis) reported in children and adults with IBS. Further, `omics (metabolomics, lipidomics, metaproteomics) data is largely missing from studies of FGIDs and is urgently required - our preliminary data show that it likely provides critical mechanistic insight into the links between abdominal pain symptoms and the pathobiologic alterations of gut dysbiosis, barrier dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysfunction which we and others have described in FGIDs. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that these alterations can pathobiologically discriminate FGIDs from healthy controls as well as identify disease mechanisms of pain in FGIDs. We propose to build on our previous work and use previously collected prospective abdominal pain and stooling diaries and stool samples collected from a large and well-vetted group of children with FGIDs (IBS n=133, FAP n=47) and healthy controls (HC, n=112). Our Hypothesis is that microbial community characterization and `omics profiling will provide biomarkers to differentiate FGIDs (IBS and FAP) from HC and generate insight into the genesis of pain symptoms (and stooling characteristics in IBS). Our Specific Aims are to use: 1) Global unbiased whole genome shotgun sequencing, metabolomics, lipidomics and metaproteomics (`omics) on stool samples to differentiate children with FGIDs vs HC using classifier models; Sub-Aim – explore potential differences between FAP and IBS and HC; and 2) Proprietary Texas Children's Hospital Microbiome Center reference databases and state-of-the art bioinformatics approaches (e.g., supervised learning, bipartite, Bayesian models) to identify disorder-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets within children with FGIDs: Sub-Aim 2a - Characterize the relationships between `omics and abdominal pain symptoms (and stooling symptoms in IBS). Sub-Aim 2b – Characterize the relationships between `omics and abnormal physiology (impaired barrier function, neuroimmune dysfunction). It is anticipated that this innovative, multidisciplinary study will better inform patient management and offer unique therapeutic strategies based on novel insights provided by FGID biomarkers. The goals of this application fit with NINR PA- 18-140, the recently published NINR Symptom Science Model, and the NIH Common Fund and Precision Medicine Initiatives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders affect 10-20% of children and adults worldwide exerting a tremendous economic, social, and emotional burden. There is a critical need to understand what factors contribute to pain in these disorders so that effective management and treatment strategies can be designed.

"Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement Project Abstract Overview: This project aims to develop a novel 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI method with novel metal artifact correction techniques to provide early identification of painful complications in the prosthetic joint area causing persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Relevance: THA is one of the most rapidly growing procedures to treat the end-stage hip joint pain and dysfunction and is estimated to reach 572,000 annual cases by 2030. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients experience PPSP after the procedure, which, without proper treatment, can significantly impair the quality of life. However, the early identification of pain generators for these patients is very difficult because the current diagnostic methods including X-ray, CT, and MRI, have limited sensitivity to pain and suffer from severe artifacts induced by metal in prostheses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a novel diagnostic approach to accurately identify the abnormal inflammatory changes causing pain without prohibitive metal artifacts to guide the appropriate treatment matched to the exact cause of pain. Approach: We propose the use of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for early identification of sources of PPSP following THA. Our previous 18F-FDG PET/MRI study of chronic pain syndromes demonstrated promising improvements in detecting sites of painful inflammation. However, the severe metal artifacts near metallic prostheses limit the application of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to THA patients. Therefore, our first aim in this project is the development of metal-aware attenuation correction for PET to enable reliable 18F-FDG PET near the metallic prosthesis. Our second aim is the development of high-resolution hip MRI at 3T with metal artifact correction to maximize our ability to identify morphologic causes of PPSP symptoms. Our third aim is to validate the improvements in detection of the painful lesions using serial 18F-FDG PET/MRI sessions. This will be accomplished by correlating the pain score measurements with 18F-FDG PET/MRI abnormalities at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months following the unilateral THA procedure. Summary: We propose to develop a novel 18F-FDG PET/MRI method with metal artifact correction techniques for early detection of complications causing PPSP following THA. Successful implementation of our method will enable early indication of individualized, effective treatments for THA patients with PPSP. Project Narrative More than a million cases of total joint arthroplasty, including those with total hip arthroplasty (THA), are performed in the U.S. each year, but 7% to 34% of the patients are reported to develop persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) after these procedures. Unfortunately, the effective pain management for those patients is significantly limited by current diagnostic methods that have insufficient sensitivity to painful complications and severe imaging artifacts from the metallic prosthesis. Focusing on patients who have undergone THA, this project will develop metal artifact correction techniques for 18F-FDG PET/MRI to implement metabolic (18F-FDG PET) and morphologic (MRI) examination of PPSP following THA for enabling the early detection of painful pathology, and thus guiding appropriate treatments.",Novel PET/MR Imaging Approach for Persistent Postsurgical Pain Following Joint Replacement,10226582,R56AR077706,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Analgesics', 'Area', 'Arthralgia', 'Awareness', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hip Joint', 'Hip Prosthesis', 'Hip region structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joint Prosthesis', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical History', 'Metabolic', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Surgery procedures', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physical shape', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postoperative Pain', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Water', 'attenuation', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical examination', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'metallicity', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pain score', 'pain symptom', 'serial imaging', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'uptake', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,577581,560644462,0.169794222286273
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen these prevention efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of patient behaviors and clinical factors that increase overdose risk.",Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs,9895708,R01DA045816,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'American', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dizziness', 'Dose', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Fatigue', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'cost', 'drug testing', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'middle age', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2020,582062,7208224,0.17388729486978963
"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,10013125,UH3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'early phase clinical trial', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multimodality', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'structured data', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,1302384,550947887,0.2815118780764673
"NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE NCATS has recently established the development of A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration (ASPIRE) to aid in the discovery and development of novel and effective treatments, while at the same time making the process faster and more cost-effective, with a particular focus on pain, OUD and overdose as part of the the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative, or NIH HEAL InitiativeSM.  The NCATS ASPIRE Program aims to develop and integrate automated synthetic chemistry, biological screening and artificial intelligence approaches in order to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between chemical and biological space and enable further access into biologically-relevant chemical space. The ASPIRE platform will utilize currently available knowledge to develop innovative algorithms and predict and synthesize novel structures capable of interacting with specific targets; enable small-scale synthesis of the predicted molecules; and incorporate in-line, rapid biological testing of the molecules. Any new data obtained through this process would then be fed back into the system to further improve design, synthesis and biological characteristics of molecules.  Over 25 million people in the United States experience pain every day (2012 National Health Interview Survey data(link is external)) and need safe, addiction-free treatments to alleviate their suffering.  This clinical demand is of tremendous importance given that overprescribing of opioids for managing acute and chronic pain has fueled the current epidemic of opioid use disorder and overdose deaths, and the effectiveness of opioids for long-term pain management is being questioned.  Safe, effective, and non-addictive drugs (small molecules and biologics) to treat pain, mitigate addiction and reverse overdose are key to addressing the opioid crisis.  Given failures and limitations of previous drug development efforts, drugs that recognize novel targets, have novel structures, and can be identified in human-based, physiologically relevant in vitro systems are needed.  To further advance the NCATS ASPIRE Program and build on the innovations of the ASPIRE Design Challenges, and reward and spur innovative solutions to the development of new drugs for pain, addiction, and overdose, NCATS is issuing this Reduction-to-Practice Challenge to highly collaborative innovators interested in developing working prototypes of novel approaches that would lead to efficacious and non-addictive pain treatments and/or novel treatments for addiction and overdose.  The ultimate goal of the NCATS ASPIRE Program under the HEAL Initiative is the development of a platform that a wide spectrum of scientists can use to advance their translational science relevant to development and pre-clinical testing of new and safer treatments of pain, OUD, and overdose. Further, it is essential that the approach developed in this phase is applicable to any translational problem. n/a",NCATS ASPIRE REDUCTION-TO-PRACTICE CHALLENGE,10285773,213775,"['Acute pain management', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Testing', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'System', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost effective', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'small molecule']",NCATS, ,N01,2020,1375000,0,0.2071509034971465
"Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 out of every 500 African Americans in the US. Characterized by chronic anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, patients with SCD also suffer from frequent and acute episodes of pain and fatigue. While current evidence indicates that chronically ill patients who engage in self-management improve their health outcomes, the multi-factorial symptoms of SCD are difficult for the patient to recognize and quantify. Interestingly, the onset of SCD complications are often associated with precipitous worsening of anemia. As such, Dr. Lam’s hematology bioengineering laboratory has recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that enables pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia, the hallmark of their disease, and potentially allow them to engage in self-management and hopefully improve their overall clinical outcomes. In addition, the Lam laboratory has also developed an optional smartphone app that enables automated analysis and potential for data transmission. With initial proof-of-concept and clinical assessment studies successfully completed and published, we believe that due to the multifactorial biobehavioral nature of pain and fatigue in SCD, children and adolescents with SCD who self-monitor their anemia with our self-test will better recognize their own levels of pain and fatigue, and be better informed about when to seek appropriate medical care. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved clinical outcomes. For this grant, we will first conduct a 3 month home-based usability study in which 20 pediatric and adolescent SCD patients will test these devices on themselves for one month. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews to solicit feedback from these patients, which will inform any modifications we need to make to the biochemistry of the assay, the physical device, and the smartphone app. We will then a conduct a larger study in which 50 SCD pediatric and adolescent patients will be asked to perform anemia self-testing in conjunction with answering pain- and fatigue-related questions the day of their monthly visits and at the onset of any worsening of pain or fatigue symptoms. Specifically, we will answer these questions: 1) Does our anemia self- test provide an additional objective metric that assists pediatric patients in recognizing SCD symptoms that reflect worsening anemia? 2) Does anemia self-testing correlate with SCD pain/fatigue symptoms? 3) Does use of our anemia self-test better inform pediatric SCD patients about when to seek appropriate medical advice/care? At the end of this project, we will have an optimized and validated system that will enable us to conduct larger scale studies to determine whether home anemia self-testing can improve the clinical outcomes for SCD patients and decrease emergency room visits and urgent hospitalizations by detecting acute complications before they become life-threatening.  Project Narrative Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that is characterized by chronic anemia and frequent episodes of acute pain, which can be associated with concurrent worsening of the anemia. We have recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that could enable pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia. The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of our anemia self-test as a means to enable and improve disease self-management for pediatric and adolescent patients with SCD.",Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients,9624759,R21EB025646,"['Acute', 'Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anemia', 'Beds', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Calibration', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Color', 'Complete Blood Count', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Technicians', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Pain', 'Pain Nature', 'Pallor', 'Parents', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Reagent', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of finger', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Underserved Population', 'Visit', 'adolescent patient', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'beta Thalassemia', 'biobehavior', 'conjunctiva', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'ear infection', 'experience', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'laboratory experience', 'mHealth', 'melanoma', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'smartphone Application', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NIBIB,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,175839,507546965,0.16322480438742587
"IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment. Create a smartphone pupillometry to objectively determine the presence of acute pain, evaluate opioid as the treatment for pain. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While patient self-report of pain is currently the gold standard of pain measurement, accurate self-reports of pain may not be feasible in critically ill patients who are sedated and intubated, unconscious patients, or patients who are unable to verbally communicate their pain. Current research has shown that pupillary dilation (PD) is a reliable indicator of acute pain, and that measurement of pupil size changes may be useful in determining the intensity of pain experienced as well as the efficacy of an analgesia. There is also research demonstrating the value of pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL) as an objective marker of sensitivity to opioids, and the use of facial expression analysis to detect pain. IMPACT proposes pupillometry with a proprietary algorithm to measure both PD and PUAL, and facial expression analysis using computer vision. Through IMPACT, Benten proposes to provide clinicians with a device that helps them objectively determine the presence or absence of pain, assess opioid efficacy, and assist in deciding whether opioids should be the treatment of choice for a patient. The utimate goal of IMPACT is to revolutionize measurement and management of pain. The novel approach of measuring PD, PUAL, and facial expressions will help eliminate subjectivity in the diagnosis of pain, and avoid over-administration of opioids or administration of opioids to patients who are not suitable candidates for opioid treatment. IMPACT will demonstrate the feasibility of using pupil size changes and facial expressions to guide the diagnosis and treatment of pain, and compare results obtained to pain scores reported by patients on the NRS, to assess accuracy of pain measurement and effectiveness in pain alleviation. IMPACT will be designed and developed to serve the needs of patients who experience severe pain, and provide them with pain relief, through objection clinical decision-making. The aims of IMPACT are as follows: 1) Phase I Specific Aims: Develop IMPACT prototype and conduct a validity test with 25  subjects, to demonstrate the efficacy and validity of IMPACT versus a commercial  pupilometer, and 2) Conduct a feasibility pilot test of IMPACT with 20 patients in the post-anesthesia care unit  (PACU) of Christiana Care Health System (CCHS), to demonstrate the feasibility of IMPACT  in determining pain and assessing opioid efficacy. The short-term impact will be an improvement in pain detection, and more objective clinical decision making regarding opioid administration. The long-term impact will be a decrease in the misuse of opioid medication, and the facilitation of objective measurement of symptoms in clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment (IMPACT) will develop an innovative, mobile application to record reliable biomarkers and surrogate markers for acute pain and opioid analgesic efficacy. IMPACT will enable clinicians to better diagnose and manage pain, through the measurement of pupillary dilation (PD) to pain, pupillary unrest under ambient light (PUAL), and facial expressions. IMPACT is designed to address the needs of patients who are in severe pain and may be unable to communicate their pain effectively. This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine the pain experienced accurately and administer analgesics that provide adequate pain relief, while also avoiding over-prescription of opioids and further contributing to the opioid crisis. Usage of IMPACT will help clinicians supplement patient reports of pain with objective measures of pain and opioid analgesic efficacy such as PD, PUAL, and facial expressions.","IMPACT-Instrument to Measure Pain and Assess Correlation to Treatment.

"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9681483,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,370300,570146095,0.17922561876894424
"Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia ABSTRACT Juvenile-onset fibromyalgia (JFM) is a debilitating, chronic pain condition affecting adolescents, primarily females, during a critical period for brain development, and that persists into adulthood for the majority of patients. Due to the lack of definite physical or laboratory findings, JFM has been questioned as a clinical entity, and sometimes regarded as merely an expression of anxiety or depression. This leads to poor understanding, stigmatization, and appropriate disease management, underscoring the need for identifying objective pathophysiology. We have previously used machine learning applied to fMRI data to yield multivariate patterns of distributed brain activity that, together, can identify test subjects as adult FM patients vs. healthy adults with high cross-validated accuracy (93%). However, extrapolating adult FM brain abnormalities to JFM is problematic, given the many factors impacting the developing adolescent brain and the clinical differences between adult and juvenile forms of the disease. The goal of this proposal is to identify brain pathophysiology characteristic of JFM during tailored symptom provocation tasks. There is currently a complete lack of research into the brain correlates of pain in children with widespread pain/JFM. This study will lay the foundation for a line of research in understanding the neurophysiologic underpinnings of JFM, discovering whether brain pathophysiology in JFM differs from adult FM, and assessing treatment effects on specific markers of brain pathophysiology. This study is an R01 ancillary study to the NIH/NIAMS-funded trial (R01 AR070474; Kashikar-Zuck), “Multi-site randomized clinical trial of Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Juvenile Fibromyalgia (FIT Teens)”. The exceptionally well characterized cohort of JFM patients from the parent trial presents a unique opportunity to study JFM neural correlates. Our time-sensitive study will transform the scientific output of the parent project by identifying neurophysiological correlates of pain, psychological and physical symptoms in this large, representative, extensively-characterized sample of JFM patients before and after treatment. We hypothesize that machine learning applied to fMRI data during tailored symptom-provocation tasks will identify patterns of neural activity predictive of JFM status (vs. healthy), which will correlate with JFM symptom dimensions (pain, non-painful sensory hypersensitivity, fatigue, and depressive symptoms). This ancillary study will utilize the comprehensive psychological and physical functioning profiles already being captured in the parent R01 trial to identify clinically meaningful neurologic measures in JFM and explore the potential for these measures to change with treatment. This line of research has the potential for a profound impact on understanding and identifying JFM pathophysiology and providing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study will use functional brain imaging to identify patterns of brain activity associated with juvenile fibromyalgia and assess treatment effects on such neural patterns. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s Federal Pain Research Strategy because of its potential for a profound impact on understanding JFM neural pathophysiology and developing neuro-physiologically informed treatment recommendations.",Identifying neural pathophysiology in juvenile fibromyalgia,9830832,R01AR074795,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exercise', 'Fatigue', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image Analysis', 'Judgment', 'Kentucky', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Neurologic', 'Ohio', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain Research', 'Pain intensity', 'Painless', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persistent pain', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stigmatization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'chronic painful condition', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical pain', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'fibromyalgia patients', 'hands-on learning', 'innovation', 'multisensory', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'pain symptom', 'parent project', 'physical symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychological symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2019,418757,168440418,0.13269038052095578
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids.

"Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation PROJECT SUMMARY Back pain has gained the distinction of being the most disabling condition in the world [1-3], affecting 80-90% of the US population at some point in their lifetime, with 29% of the US population having experienced lower back pain within the last 3 months. Back and neck pain are the leading cause of missed work days and rank second only to the common cold as a reason for a visit to the doctor, accounting for approximately 30% of general practitioner visits. Of particular concern is chronic low back pain (cLBP), which is recurrent and often non-responsive to conservative treatments. It has long been recognized that spinal pathology changes the way that we move. Biomechanists, physical therapists, and surgeons each utilize a variety of tools and techniques to assess and interpret qualitative movement changes as a window to understanding potential mechanical and neurological sources of low back pain and as a critical element in their treatment paradigm. However, objectively characterizing and communicating this information is currently impossible, since clinically feasible (e.g., cost-effective, objective, and accurate) tools and quantitative benchmarks do not exist. This proposal addresses the challenge to improve cLBP outcomes through the use of unique, inexpensive, screen-printable, elastomer-based nano-composite piezoresponsive sensors which will be integrated into a SPInal Nanosensor Environment (SPINE Sense System) to measure lumbar kinematics and provide an objective, quantitative platform for diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up assessment of cLBP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our Technology Research Site team is dedicated to improving our ability to diagnose and treat low back pain. Our approach is to utilize a wearable nano-biosensing/biofeedback system to measure low back movements and incorporate that information into a platform for both diagnosis and treatment of chronic low back pain.",Wearable nanocomposite sensor system for diagnosing mechanical sources of low back pain and guiding rehabilitation,9897908,UH2AR076723,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Articular Range of Motion', 'Back', 'Back Pain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biofeedback', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Chronic low back pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Common Cold', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elastomers', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Legal patent', 'Low Back Pain', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neck Pain', 'Neurologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nano', 'nanocomposite', 'nanosensors', 'new technology', 'off-patent', 'pain outcome', 'pain patient', 'phenotypic data', 'physical therapist', 'practical application', 'prototype', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY,UH2,2019,725641,6579725,0.28814754127215114
"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9949294,UH3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multimodality', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,1355545,550947887,0.2815118780764673
"Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain PROJECT ABSTRACT Neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) is an ocular type of neuropathic pain. It causes patients to have severe discomfort and a severely compromised quality of life (QoL). The lack of signs observed by standard examination has resulted in misdiagnosis as dry eye disease (DED) resulting in an inefficient use of healthcare funds. The identification of a diagnostic biomarker for NCP and development of a detection method would allow adequate and timely treatment, improve patients’ QoL, and decrease the health care system’s financial burden. An optical biopsy can be performed using laser in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), which allows for visualization of subbasal corneal nerves at a quasi-histological level. Preliminary data has shown that IVCM identified microneuromas (a bulb at the end of a severed nerve caused by build-up of molecular constituents) are present in NCP, but not DED, patients. We propose to validate microneuromas as a novel biomarker for NCP. In Aim 1 we will use our database of over 2,000 DED/NCP subjects and over 500,000 IVCM images to confirm that the presence of microneuromas is an appropriate biomarker for NCP by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of identification of NCP patients via microneuromas to other IVCM parameters. Three observers will each grade images twice for this confirmed biomarker to assess inter- and intra-observer precision, and descriptive statistics of the IVCM datasets will allow for determination of the minimum number of images necessary for high precision of microneuroma detection. Aim 2 will provide biological validation of microneuromas. Both the intensity of ocular pain and the compromise to QoL caused by ocular pain as assessed by the Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. Further, the change in ocular pain/discomfort in response to instillation of hyperosmolar saline into the eyes will be compared between those with microneuromas and those without. In Aim 3 we will develop a validated artificial intelligence (AI) program for automated identification of microneuromas to allow rapid and wide-scale adoption by clinicians. Accuracy of the program will be determined by evaluating the agreement of the AI program’s assessment of IVCM images with the assessment of 2 observers. A similar assessment of accuracy will be assessed using images obtained from an independent site so that inter-site precision can be evaluated. The AI program will also be assessed for its specificity and sensitivity in NCP identification. Aim 4 will establish the clinical utility of microneuromas observed by IVCM as a biomarker for NCP in a prospective, multi-center study. The biomarker’s precision, reference intervals, and harmonization of performance between sites as well as the sensitivity and specificity of NCP diagnosis will be determined using this prospective cohort. Next, the microneuroma findings will be correlated with the OPAS and hyperosmolar functional tests for biological validation. Finally, the AI program’s ability to provide a diagnosis of NCP will be tested using the IVCM images from this study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have suggested that over $3.84 billion is spent annually in the US to treat dry eye disease, but only 37.3% of them reported being satisfied with their treatment. Recent evidence suggests that many of these patients have a condition called neuropathic corneal pain, which causes severe compromise to patients’ quality of life. However, there is currently no practical means of objectively diagnosing patients with neuropathic corneal pain. Validating a biomarker and developing a clinical method of properly diagnosing these patients should result in timely treatment and higher treatment success rates and therefore improved patient lives and a reduced financial burden on the healthcare system.",Discovery of the Biomarker Signature for Neuropathic Corneal Pain,9829699,R61NS113341,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Cornea', 'Corneal pain', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Ensure', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Fiber', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Plexus', 'Neuropathy', 'Optical Biopsy', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polyneuropathy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Saline', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Topical application', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'artificial neural network', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'clinical research site', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'eye dryness', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'ocular pain', 'pain patient', 'pain symptom', 'painful neuropathy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'response', 'sex', 'software development', 'somatosensory', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal', 'validation studies']",NINDS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2019,2120854,17640378,0.2058769542300289
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective.

"Non-invasive quantitative hemoglobin self-monitoring using only smartphone images for chronic anemia patients Abstract  Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 1 out of every 500 African Americans in the US. Characterized by chronic anemia, or low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, patients with SCD also suffer from frequent and acute episodes of pain and fatigue. While current evidence indicates that chronically ill patients who engage in self-management improve their health outcomes, the multi-factorial symptoms of SCD are difficult for the patient to recognize and quantify. Interestingly, the onset of SCD complications are often associated with precipitous worsening of anemia. As such, Dr. Lam’s hematology bioengineering laboratory has recently developed an inexpensive, disposable, patient-operated, color-based, diagnostic that enables pediatric SCD patients to objectively self-monitor their anemia, the hallmark of their disease, and potentially allow them to engage in self-management and hopefully improve their overall clinical outcomes. In addition, the Lam laboratory has also developed an optional smartphone app that enables automated analysis and potential for data transmission. With initial proof-of-concept and clinical assessment studies successfully completed and published, we believe that due to the multifactorial biobehavioral nature of pain and fatigue in SCD, children and adolescents with SCD who self-monitor their anemia with our self-test will better recognize their own levels of pain and fatigue, and be better informed about when to seek appropriate medical care. This, in turn, could lead to reductions in emergency room visits and hospitalizations and improved clinical outcomes. For this grant, we will first conduct a 3 month home-based usability study in which 20 pediatric and adolescent SCD patients will test these devices on themselves for one month. We will then conduct semi-structured interviews to solicit feedback from these patients, which will inform any modifications we need to make to the biochemistry of the assay, the physical device, and the smartphone app. We will then a conduct a larger study in which 50 SCD pediatric and adolescent patients will be asked to perform anemia self-testing in conjunction with answering pain- and fatigue-related questions the day of their monthly visits and at the onset of any worsening of pain or fatigue symptoms. Specifically, we will answer these questions: 1) Does our anemia self- test provide an additional objective metric that assists pediatric patients in recognizing SCD symptoms that reflect worsening anemia? 2) Does anemia self-testing correlate with SCD pain/fatigue symptoms? 3) Does use of our anemia self-test better inform pediatric SCD patients about when to seek appropriate medical advice/care? At the end of this project, we will have an optimized and validated system that will enable us to conduct larger scale studies to determine whether home anemia self-testing can improve the clinical outcomes for SCD patients and decrease emergency room visits and urgent hospitalizations by detecting acute complications before they become life-threatening.

"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9567925,UG3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'pain outcome', 'pain reduction', 'pain relief', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2018,250000,550947887,0.2815118780764673
"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9472308,R33DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'Ice', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid agonist', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R33,2018,358150,24781998,0.33332570063293315
"Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated  Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART) ABSTRACT There is a clear need to develop improved tools to stratify risk in patients who seek emergency care for chest pain, one of the most common and potentially deadliest conditions encountered in acute care settings. The ECG has been the mainstay of initial evaluation of chest pain patients, yet is currently only diagnostic for a small subset of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Our well-rounded and collaborative team has been working together for the past four years to develop novel ECG interpretation algorithms that can greatly enhance the utility of the ECG in the early evaluation of acute coronary disease. This line of work is already substantiated by pilot studies that have identified candidate markers of ECG characteristics and preliminary algorithms that can identify patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction as well as those with very low risk of coronary artery disease. With these improved tools, emergency providers (physicians, nurses, and paramedics) will be able to streamline the care provided to these patients beyond the costly and time- consuming overnight observation for serial cardiac enzymes and provocative testing. This grant will provide needed resources for our team to enroll a cohort of over 1,800 patients needed to confirm the accuracy of these ECG markers and determine their maximal clinical utility as part of a risk stratification tool. It builds directly on our existing work in this area, which has already yielded necessary preliminary data and multiple joint publications. Validating this technology will set the groundwork for the future development and testing of targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes in non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. SUMMARY/NARRATIVE Current guidelines for diagnosing and treating myocardial infarction (MI) are based on identifying ST elevation (STE) on the 12-lead ECG, yet only one third of MI patients exhibit such elevation. We propose to (1) extend our prior research of novel repolarization indices of non-STE MI available on the initial ECG and (2) incorporate this information into real-time machine-learning algorithms for clinical decision support, which will improve our sensitivity in detecting and treating MI very early during urgent care. Such early and non-invasively acquired diagnostics can improve outcomes and save costs for millions of patients with chest pain annually.",Electrocardiographic Detection of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Events for Accelerated Classification of Chest Pain Encounters (ECG-SMART),9520500,R01HL137761,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Attenuated', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergency medical service', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infarction', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Muscle strain', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Nitrates', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pain Measurement', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pre-hospital setting', 'Pre-hospitalization care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Troponin', 'Unstable angina', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'billing data', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pain patient', 'patient subsets', 'perfusion imaging', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic value', 'reduce symptoms', 'secondary outcome', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urgent care']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,370376,570146095,0.17922561876894424
"Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Pain and effective pain management are among the most critical health issues facing Americans. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reported that as many as one-third of all Americans experience persistent pain at an annual cost of as much as $635 billion in medical treatment and lost productivity. Prescription opioids are increasingly used to treat acute and chronic pain. To date, epidemiologic research defining opioid-related adverse drug event (ADE) risk factors has relied on broad, static categorizations of risk derived from diagnostic codes. Though important foundational work, these studies have three important limitations: (1) they focus on only the most catastrophic ADE (overdose) and thus miss the opportunity to identify less severe, prodromal ADEs (e.g. fatigue, dizziness, sleepiness, over-sedation) that may precede and predict overdose; (2) they do not reliably capture aberrant drug-related behaviors (ADRBs)—risky patterns of use that may affect overdose risk; and (3) they rely on clinician- coded diagnoses in structured data, which have notoriously weak sensitivity and specificity, and neglect rich opioid-related information from unstructured clinical narratives. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of electronic health records and new computational methdologies to explore associations among prodromal adverse events, ADRBs, and overdose. This approach is critical to the development of next-generation opioid overdose prevention tools. ""Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs"" Death rates among middle-aged adults, the largest demographic group in the U.S., are on the rise for the first time in several decades, largely because of the increase in drug overdose, the majority of which are due to prescription opioids. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen these prevention efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of patient behaviors and clinical factors that increase overdose risk.",Identifying Opioid Overdose Predictors using EHRs,9498915,R01DA045816,"['Acute Pain', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'American', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dizziness', 'Dose', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Fatigue', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Informatics', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Opioid', 'Outpatients', 'Overdose', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persistent pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'cost', 'drug testing', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'middle age', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose prevention', 'overdose risk', 'prescription opioid', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS LOWELL,R01,2018,649552,7208224,0.17388729486978963
"Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments? Project Summary / Abstract Temporomandibular disorders (TMD), characterized by persistent pain in the cheek and jaw area of the face, affect approximately 1 in 10 women at some point in their lives. TMD treatments primarily focus on peripheral factors; however, many patients with TMD show no signs of peripheral damage. It is now known that many chronic pain conditions, including TMD, involve pain centralization, meaning the pain is generated and maintained by central, rather than peripheral, nervous system processes. There are currently no well accepted means through which centralized TMD pain can be identified in the clinic, and the failure to properly identify these centralized cases means that ineffective peripheral treatments are administered. The specific aims of this project are to 1) Demonstrate that structural, functional, and neurochemical abnormalities exist in TMD that are similar to those reported in other centralized pain conditions, 2) Utilize questionnaire and quantitative sensory testing measures that can accurately detect centralized pain to place patients on a continuum from peripheral to centralized, and show that the brains of centralized, but not peripheral, patients differ significantly from healthy controls, and 3) Determine the measures of centralization and brain morphology, function, and chemistry that predict lack of improvement from a peripherally targeted treatment regimen, to show that centralized TMD patients do not respond as well to treatments that fail to target their pathology. The primary goal of the mentored (K99) portion of the award is to give the candidate the additional training in neuroimaging necessary for him to obtain a tenure track faculty position and successfully run his own independent research program. The K99 phase will take place at the University of Michigan, under the mentorship of Drs. Daniel Clauw, Richard Harris, and David Williams, who are world-renowned experts in centralized pain conditions, pain neuroimaging, and pain psychometrics, respectively. Dr. William Maixner (Duke University), a world- leading expert on TMD, will also serve as a mentor; he will advise the candidate on the clinically relevant aspects of TMD and help the candidate network with other more established TMD researchers. The University of Michigan is ideal for the K99 phase of the project because of the available resources, including faculty who are committed to clinical pain research and mentoring, research-devoted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and state-of-the-art pain testing equipment, and ample laboratory and office space at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center. Upon completing the K99 portion of the award, the candidate will be well suited to make the transition to tenure-track faculty. Project Narrative TMD, which is the most prevalent orofacial pain condition, is a public health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life and function of numerous individuals. This project addresses large gaps in our knowledge of pain centralization in TMD, building off of what is currently known from other pain conditions. Improvement in our understanding of the etiology of TMD and how it influences treatment will be crucial to bring individualized medicine to TMD patients. As a first step, we will determine what central factors make the prevailing peripheral treatments less effective. The results of this project will inform future studies of TMD by pinpointing the most promising variables to measure in longitudinal treatment studies of TMD.",Mechanistic Characterization of Pain in Temporomandibular Disorders: Does Pain Centralization Influence Responsiveness to Peripherally Targeted Treatments?,9295562,K99DE026810,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Cheek structure', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Fatigue', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insula of Reil', 'Jaw', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Michigan', 'Motor Cortex', 'Naproxen', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nociception', 'Orofacial Pain', 'Pain', 'Pain Research', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Persistent pain', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Soft Diet', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporomandibular Joint Disorders', 'Temporomandibular joint disorder pain', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain morphology', 'central pain', 'chronic pain', 'chronic pelvic pain', 'clinically relevant', 'dietary restriction', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tenure track']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K99,2017,118260,641965656,0.38681256546218457
"Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment Abstract In 2015 alone, 97,223 new Veterans under age 35 began receiving compensation for injuries related to their military service. In total, there are 559,999 post-9/11 Veterans being compensated for back or neck conditions, and a partially overlapping 596,250 for limitation of flexion in joints. Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. Early intervention is needed to arrest worsening pain and risky substance use, particularly among post-9/11 Veterans for whom engagement in non-pharmacological pain treatment has the potential to improve their overall quality of life and spare them the complications of opioid treatments. The service-connection application is an ideal point-of-contact for initiating early intervention treatments for these at-risk Veterans. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and risky substance use. In brief, the counselor explains that treating both physical and psychological aspects of pain leads to the best outcomes, outlines what VA (and non-VA if preferred) services are available to Veterans, explains that substances are sometimes used for pain relief, and segues into traditional SBIRT. SBIRT-PM's efficacy is supported by a completed clinical trial of 101 Veterans applying for service-connection for MSD, and by studies showing the efficacy of SBIRT for people with risky substance use and of Motivational Interviewing for engagement in non-pharmacological pain care. The study will involve a two-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single “hub” site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM, and a four-year period to conduct the clinical trial and disseminate its findings. During the two-years of preparation for the clinical trial, the team will prepare SBIRT-PM for implementation by establishing communication (Relational Coordination is the theoretical framework) between the “hub” where the SBIRT-PM clinician is sited and the “spoke” sites, establishing study- related procedures, and piloting the intervention at each of the eight VA medical centers in New England. For the full clinical trial, we will randomize 1200 Veterans applying for compensation related to MSD to either SBIRT-PM or Usual Care (UC) across eight VA medical centers in New England. Outcome assessment by phone will occur at 12 and 36-week follow-ups, and will be corroborated with other sources of information ---the electronic health record and toxicology testing of nail clippings. We hypothesize that, compared to Usual Care, SBIRT-PM will be more effective and cost-effective in improving Veterans' pain and substance use. We further hypothesize that a mediator of these improvements will be use of non-pharmacological services, as extracted from VA records from structured data fields and from narrative text in the medical record using an innovative natural language processing algorithm. Screening and referral to treatment at service-connection examinations can transform a widely-used point of entry to VA into a health-promoting encounter. Narrative Veterans seeking compensation for musculoskeletal conditions often develop chronic pain and are at high risk for substance misuse. We propose to test the effectiveness and cost- effectiveness of Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment for Pain Management (SBIRT-PM), designed to reduce pain and reduce risky substance use, in part by helping Veterans get comprehensive pain treatment. The study will involve a 2-year period to arrange for clinicians at a single site to counsel Veterans throughout New England by phone with SBIRT-PM as part of a clinical trial, and a 4-year period to conduct the trial and disseminate its findings.",Engaging Veterans Seeking Service-Connection Payments in Pain Treatment,9445873,UG3AT009758,"['Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brief Pain Inventory', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Cost Analysis', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury compensation', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Military Personnel', 'Modality', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Nail plate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neck', 'New England', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pain interference', 'Pain management', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Site Visit', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'pain symptom', 'payment', 'pragmatic trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'screening', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance misuse', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment as usual', 'willingness to pay']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UG3,2017,250000,550947887,0.2815118780764673
"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,9439282,R33DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'Ice', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R33,2017,347850,24781998,0.33332570063293315
"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. This project capitalizes on recent breakthroughs in measuring human brain activity and using it to objectively assess the brain processes that underlie pain experience, which could transform the way pain is measured and new treatments are developed.",fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain,9245657,R01DA035484,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Back Pain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Naproxen', 'Nerve Pain', 'Nociception', 'Pain', 'Pain Measurement', 'Pain intensity', 'Pain management', 'Pain quality', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Validation', 'Visceral pain', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'allodynia', 'arthritic pain', 'base', 'chronic pain', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'distraction', 'duloxetine', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'mental imagery', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'painful neuropathy', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remifentanil', 'response', 'social', 'spontaneous pain', 'success']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2017,587021,492483,0.3976019510718777

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. Critically, the biomarker is specific to physical pain when compared with non-painful touch and several classes of salient, affective events. In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment.

"Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a major medical challenge, with the number of Americans seeking treatment exceeding the number affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. The treatment of chronic pain is provided almost exclusively in outpatient settings by standard-care providers, allied health professionals, and complementary and alternative medicine practitioners. Treatment is challenging because chronic pain can lead to depression, hopelessness and drug dependence, as well as reductions in creativity, performance, motivation, and treatment compliance. It creates a large financial drain on social services, insurance providers, and family resources. Lacking independent tests for pain intensity, diagnosis depends on the information exchange between the patient and the health professional. Therefore, informatics can play a pivotal role in creating and disseminating evidence-based medicine technologies within the practice of pain management. To provide evidence-based medicine, the reservoirs of evidence-generating medicine must be tapped and used effectively. To enable this, there is a critical need to map 'person in pain' phenotypes to effective treatments and to disseminate that knowledge with decision support tools.  The fundamental hypothesis of this work is that secondary care, pain specialist practices can serve as rich reservoirs of evidence-generating information. To explore this possibility, Michigan State University (MSU) has partnered with Michigan Pain Consultants (MPC) to build a phenotype-to-outcome model for pain treatment, utilizing MPC's rich data repositories of administrative data, proprietary patient survey data, and detailed progress notes from approximately 80,000 visits per year. In this proof-of-concept study, we plan to identify, extract, and organize the informatio content of the MPC data reservoir and then create, test, and validate a model uniting person-in-pain phenotypes with treatments and optimal outcomes. In future work we plan to expand this study to include more areas of pain management and to design decision support tools that will allow enhanced treatment for this largest and most challenging cause of chronic morbidity in the US. Full completion of this project will require the powerful tools of natural language processing, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, active learning methodologies, and clinical decision support software designs.  The most important benefit of this work is that a health IT solution will be derived from, and implemented back within, community clinical medicine. Thus, it represents its stakeholders in the closest manner possible. Secondarily, the database generated by this work will enable future research; the process of working with specialist practices will provide a template for other such initiatives; and, the architecture of the solution will create a model for other community-based informatics solutions. The focused goal of this funding request is to establish a proof-of-concept infrastructure to enable these various endpoints. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health and the mission of AHRQ because it aims to apply the principles of evidence-based medicine to pain management decisions in community practice. To accomplish this, the rich data repositories of secondary care pain clinics will be extracted, analyzed, and consolidated for eventual use in a queryable decision support tool that will link symptoms, histories, findings, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for the various pain phenotypes typifying chronic pain.",Phenotype Modeling and Outcome Mapping for Pain Management Decision Support,8900248,R21HS022335,[' '],AHRQ,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,151853,89938253,0.31296710887484125
"Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to control pain remains a major problem in medicine and society. According to the Institute of Medicine, chronic pain affects about 100 million American adults, more people than those affected by diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. It has been estimated that the costs associated with pain in the USA exceeds $600 billion dollars per year, mainly due to medical treatment and lost productivity. While these expenditures are significant, the costs in terms of suffering and quality of life cannot be adequately calculated. Opioid analgesics, such as morphine and its analogs, have been the mainstay for treatment of pain for thousands of years, and currently represent the ""gold-standard"" for pain management. However, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. Endogenous peptides regulate activity within the central nervous system (CNS), and are particularly interesting for the treatment of pain, depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the clinical usage of peptide-based agents is limited by poor physicochemical (PC) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, which restrict penetration into the CNS. Therefore, these peptide-based agents cannot be employed clinically for the treatment of pain. The present proposal aims to develop and employ a new fluorination strategy to rationally improve biophysical properties of peptide-based probes with insufficient drug-like properties, and to allow for these probes to enter the CNS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many clinically employed analgesics possess undesired side effects, including convulsions, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, tolerance and dependence. Therefore, clinicians are conservative in prescribing, and patients are conservative in taking, opioids due to valid concerns about adverse effects as well as social and legal issues. As a result, pain is often undertreated, and patients continue to suffer. The present proposal seeks to explore strategies for delivering other small-molecule analgesics with limited side effect profiles into the central nervous system for the treatment of pain.            ",Evaluation of Physicochemical Properties Imparted by Fluorinated Peptidomimetics,8823966,R21DA036730,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'American', 'Amides', 'Analgesics', 'Anxiety', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Constipation', 'Convulsions', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Employment', 'Enkephalins', 'Euphoria', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Fluorine', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphine', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuropeptides', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Opioid Peptide', 'Opioid Receptor', 'Pain', 'Pain management', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Ventilatory Depression', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'chronic pain', 'cost', 'functional group', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'peptidomimetics', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'social', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R21,2015,187500,24781998,0.33332570063293315
"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow. The proposal will use our previous experience and current results from a large-scale multi-center study (n=3500) and from an ongoing program project (n=1500) to evaluate important dimensions of psychological distress and cognitive style.  The third component recognizes that adequate analysis of multiple evaluation procedures requires considerable knowledge and expertise in advance statistical methods. The research team includes a statistician, Dr. Eric Bair, who is especially knowledgeable about these types of analyses and experiences including the multi-center study and the program project cited above.  The research team is particularly well prepared to conduct the proposed investigation because of significant experience and expertise in the proposed methods including clinical assessment and treatment of vulvodynia, psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain and sensory function and sophisticated statistical analysis of data from pain assessments. The proposed work is supported by a significant amount of pertinent preliminary data that includes advanced clinical and psychophysical methodology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is a disabling chronic pain condition that affects 14 million women in the USA at some point in their lifetime. Little is known about the underlying mechanism and effective treatment of women with vulvodynia.

In addition, it achieves this level of accuracy when applied prospectively to new samples, across different scanners and paradigms.  This preliminary success raises a number of issues that must be addressed before fMRI-based biomarkers can be used in large-scale clinical trials and clinical practice, including a) robustnes across laboratories and procedures, b) specificity to body site, modality, and quality of pain, c) responses to analgesic treatment, and d) applicability to spontaneous and acute hypersensitivity/allodynia in clinical populations. Here, we propose to aggregate existing data across a consortium of researchers, allowing more extensive tests of sensitivity and specificity across 13 fMRI studies in healthy individuals and 18 studies in diverse clinical pain populations. In addition, we will conduct five new experiments to address critical aspects of biomarker performance. These data will allow us to develop and validate new, more comprehensive biomarkers that can assess multiple aspects of pain across healthy individuals and chronic pain sufferers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain affects nearly everyone at some time in their lives, with enormous costs to individuals and society. Current treatments for pain are only modestly effective, in large part because pain is created through a complex set of brain processes and can be measured only by patients' self-reports, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment.

"PROFILING VULVODYNIA BASED ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ENDOPHENOTYPES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia (VD) is a chronic pain disorder affecting up to 15% of women and resulting in substantial impairment in health-related quality-of-life. The treatment of the disorder is hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding its neurobiological basis. The proposed study is based on the general hypothesis that like other persistent pain conditions, VD clinical phenotypes are composed of multiple biological endophenotypes, and that meaningful subgroups can be identified. In the current proposal, we plan to extensively phenotype a large sample of VD patients using functional and structural brain imaging together with genetic, physiological, and biological parameters. We hypothesize that central mechanisms (including alterations in the processing/modulation of interoceptive signals from the external genitals) are important determinants of the clinical presentation, and that differences in these brain signatures could play an important role in treatment responsiveness. Such phenotyping has considerable implications for future drug development. We propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize alterations in multimodal structural brain and connectivity indices in VD. This will be accomplished by applying complex network analysis and machine learning algorithms to compare resting state [RS] functional and structural (grey and white matter) brain imaging in VD patients to 200 age-matched female healthy controls (HC), 200 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and 100 patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome which are available from a large brain scan repository at UCLA. Aim 2 will characterize the connectivity indices in VD and identify the association between structural (grey and white matter) and RS alterations with clinical, behavioral and genetic parameters. This will be accomplished by associating structural and RS functional abnormalities identified in Aim 1 with relevant parameters including: clinical (symptom severity, disease duration, co-morbid pain or psychiatric diagnosis), behavioral (pressure pain thresholds), and biological (candidate gene polymorphisms belonging to clusters of genes related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis function, pain, inflammatory, catecholamine, and serotonin signaling systems). Aim 3 will identify VD patient subgroups based on endophenotype clusters by applying advanced mathematical classification techniques to brain, biological, behavioral and clinical endophenotypes. This will be accomplished by combining imaging and other phenotyping data using unsupervised machine learning algorithms and will yield distinct mechanistic subgroups of VD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vulvodynia is an understudied, often disabling chronic pain disorder that affects up to 15% of women. Current treatment is limited by lack of knowledge of its causes.

"A Necessary Multi-Parametric Evaluation of Vulvodynia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulvodynia is a poorly understood and treated chronic pain disorder that affects an estimated 14 million women and is characterized by significant variation in location, temporal characteristics and clinical course. The contribution o multiple known and unknown components hinders adequate diagnosis and consequently rational choice of treatment. Identification and assessment of these underlying mechanisms would greatly advance the phenotyping of this prevalent disorder, which is a necessary step towards efficacious treatment.  The proposed methods contain three necessary components. The first provides a systemic clinical exam of vulvar mucosa and muscle that is broadened greatly to include consideration of pain processes that are initiated by persistent pain. These include spinally-mediated C-fiber temporal summation, central sensitization and altered pain regulatory mechanisms that include decreased descending inhibition and increased descending facilitation. The methods will also evaluate a general pain amplification mechanism that has been observed in vulvodynia, fibromyalgia and low back pain, and that is likely distinct from spinally-mediated central sensitization.  The second component recognizes the influence of psychological variables that determine distinct subgroups in other disorders and that can influence pain through physiological mechanisms ranging from increased muscle tension to increased sympathetic outflow.

"fMRI-based Biomarkers for Multiple Components of Pain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective biomarkers of pathology exist for a number of diseases, and their development is one of the great advances of modern allopathic medicine. However, objective assessment of pain and other mental health disorders has lagged far behind. Pain cannot be explained by peripheral damage alone; it is caused by a variety of neuropathological processes, which has made it difficult to assess and treat. Currently, the only acceptable way to measure pain is by self-report, which presents a serious barrier to effective research and treatment. Self-reported pain is influenced by nociceptive, affective, and cognitive decision-making processes-and though there are many treatments that can influence reported pain, they likely do so through a heterogeneous set of neurophysiological mechanisms, with different consequences for health and long-term well being. As a result, in spite of a long history of research, current treatments for pain are effective for a minority of individuals, with enormous costs to patients and to society.  Biomarkers for physical pain could dramatically improve diagnosis and treatment, by allowing pain to be characterized on the basis of underlying neuropathology, rather than external symptoms. They could also improve treatment, by allowing interventions to be targeted to type of neuropathology involved.  Biomarkers that can shed light on the brain pathophysiology that causes pain must necessarily rely on direct measures of brain function. In the past several years, major advances in combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with machine learning techniques-algorithms for finding predictive patterns in complex datasets-have brought the goal of fMRI-based pain assessment within reach. In preliminary data, we show for the first time that fMRI activity can predict whether an individual person is experiencing high or low physical pain with over 90% sensitivity and specificity.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Pain & Pain Management in a Medicaid Waiver Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes made to the previously submitted abstract are bracketed in the following. Poor, older adults are a vulnerable population at increased risk for [cancer], pain, poor pain management and pain management outcomes. Older adults are more likely to develop cancer and have it diagnosed at a later stage, when pain is more likely. Research has not examined the differences in pain, pain management and [pain management] outcomes between persons with and without a diagnosis of cancer among Medicaid-enrolled, older adults participating in Home and Community-Based Waiver programs (HCBWP). Additionally, no research has explored the negative effect that pain and cancer may have on the transfer of HCBWP participants to nursing homes. As HCBWP are used as an alternative to nursing home care, research that examines [cancer, pain, pain management and pain management outcomes] is vitally important in order to determine if waiver programs are truly effective in meeting the needs of participants while allowing them to remain in the community. The overall objective of the proposed research is to increase knowledge regarding pain, pain management, and pain management outcomes in HCBWP, while comparing those with and without a diagnosis of cancer. [A secondary, exploratory objective is to examine if pain, pain management, and pain management outcomes among older adult HCBWP participants with and without cancer is associated with the transition of older adult HCBWP participants to a nursing home]. The proposed research will be a secondary analysis of data from the Minimum Data Set Home Care (MDS-HC), the State of Michigan Cancer Surveillance Data and Michigan Medicaid paid claims files, and will be of a longitudinal design. Generalized Estimating Equations, logistic regression and survival analysis methods will be used to test hypotheses generated from study aims. Aim 1 is to explore differences, overtime, in pain between HCBWP participants with and without a diagnosis of cancer among waiver participants. Aim 2 is to compare, overtime, how pain relates to pain management strategies, pain control and physical function among HCBWP participants and how this relationship differs among those with and without a diagnosis of cancer. [An exploratory analysis will be done to determine if differences exist in the transition of HCBWP participants to nursing homes between HCBWP participants with and without a diagnosis of cancer and what effect pain, pain management and pain management outcomes have on this transition]. The proposed research builds on the applicant's doctoral program foci and will provide a foundation for her future as a nurse researcher, focusing on pain and pain management and pain management outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Issues related to long-term care for older-adults will become increasingly important as the percentage of the population above 65 continues to rise. The proposed research addresses two National Nursing Research Agenda (NNRA) research priorities: long-term care for older adults and symptom management for pain.           Issues related to long-term care for older-adults will become increasingly important as the percentage of the population above 65 continues to rise.

"Neuroimaging-based biomarkers for two components of pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain. The challenge Pain is a central health problem that affects quality of life and productivity for a large segment of the population. Lost work time due to pain costs America an estimated $65 billion annually. The challenge in this request for applications is to define robust and meaningful biomarkers that can serve as objective, quantitative measures of pain-related processes. Currently, pain assessment is based almost exclusively on patients' self- reports, which are inherently limited by the complex relationship between biological nociceptive (pain-related) processes and patients' verbal or written descriptions of pain. Objective biomarkers would be useful for both understanding pain and for predicting pain when self-reports are unavailable or unreliable. They would accelerate the pace of research on pain and enhance patient care in several ways. First, biomarkers could serve as intermediate outcome measures in clinical trials and treatments, making clinical trials less costly and treatments better matched to patients' individual needs. Second, biomarkers could help develop new interventions for pain that directly target specific brain systems, i.e., with non-invasive brain stimulation, which would open up new possibilities for pain management. Third, research on biomarkers could improve the quality of decision-making about pain in legal contexts. Our approach We outline a proposal for using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in conjunction with other methods, to develop and validate biomarkers for two components of reported pain experience in an acute, experimentally induced pain setting. A central part of this endeavor is the use of machine-learning algorithms to develop optimal fMRI-based predictors of pain. Machine-learning based biomarkers are essentially patterns of activity across brain regions with maximal predictive accuracy and discriminative validity for separating physical and non-physical (e.g., social or emotional) pain. These patterns can serve as the basis for tracking multiple components of pain processing without relying on self-report. Rather than simply trying to develop alternative measures that predict self-reports, however, we place a particular emphasis on identifying separable component brain processes that make different contributions to pain reports. By identifying biomarkers for component processes underlying pain, we aim to develop objective, brain-based measures of ""intermediate phenotypes"" that could be independently targeted for treatment, and so are useful in their own right beyond their ability to provide surrogate measures for pain reports.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to identify the brain components that contribute to pain in a particular individual would allow care providers to select treatments appropriate for the individual. We have specific reason to believe that at least two separable components can be identified. New results from our laboratory suggest that at least two distinct brain networks make separable contributions to reported pain. One network, the ""pain-processing network"" (PPN), responds to painful peripheral stimulation (e.g., heat on the skin), and includes classic pain-processing regions. A second network, the ""emotional appraisal network"" (EAN), does not respond to stimulation of the body, but is involved in the cognitive generation of emotion. In our recent fMRI work on pain, both networks appear to make independent contributions to predicting how much pain a person will report in response to a given stimulus. Our goal is to develop biomarkers based on these two putative components. We plan to achieve these broad goals using converging evidence from three complementary approaches, each of which will be pursued in parallel and addressed in one Specific Aim. In Aim 1, we will develop fMRI- based pain biomarkers using machine learning techniques. We will use a set of fMRI data from several acute thermal pain experiments collected in our laboratory over the past 3 years (combined N = 157). These datasets have highly homogenous scanning and experimental protocols and were designed with the goal of fMRI-based pain prediction in mind. Their existence will allow us to accelerate the pace of computational biomarker development. In Aim 2, we will test whether the fMRI-based biomarkers we develop are causally related to pain, using combined fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Biomarkers that are causally related to pain are most likely to be useful as targets for drug or other treatments. We will stimulate regions within the PPN and EAN during fMRI scanning, and test whether effects on activity and connectivity in each network predict changes in pain experience. In Aim 3, we will extend our biomarker validation to chronic pain. We will test whether biomarkers developed in Aims 1 and 2 predict patterns of hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli in patients with focal lesions in the PPN and EAN. Together, these approaches provide three complementary ways of developing and validating fMRI-based biomarkers for pain. )       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses broad Challenge Area (03) Biomarker Discovery and Validation, and Specific Challenge topic 03-DA-101, Biomarkers for Pain.
