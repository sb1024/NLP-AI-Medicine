"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9807978,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2019,235500,0.06333542742608513
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9821134,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2019,154695,0.09524717884449392
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.05658815319385129
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9743863,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,720889,0.1608150437112739
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9762979,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,513970,0.16767193577291256
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9835007,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2019,45016,0.08551694905331635
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",9714930,R01MH119177,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Data', 'Death Certificates', 'Detection', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'demographics', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insurance claims', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'model design', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'validation studies']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,779940,0.15911900799949502
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,9834058,F31MH120973,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fellowship', 'Foster Home Care', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Workers', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abuse neglect', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'child protective service', 'cohort', 'experience', 'foster care', 'health service use', 'high school', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'opioid epidemic', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'response', 'service intervention', 'stem', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.14395382810635785
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,0.017314861177253775
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,0.04814289003631826
"2/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities. Large data sets are needed to understand how the multifaceted interplay of genetics, including polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and social determinants of health, such as employment and educational attainment, can impact the risk of these psychiatric disorders and clinical outcomes, such as multiple psychiatric hospitalizations. PRSs have shown potential for risk prediction, but the clinical utility of PRSs for psychiatric conditions is just starting to be explored. Research utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers the promise of large data sets to examine these relationships in cohorts of patients seen in clinical practice. However, the use of EHRs is in its infancy in the study of psychiatric disorders and their treatment. This study will address critical knowledge gaps in “genotype-psychiatric phenotype” relationships in large, demographically and geographically diverse population-based samples derived from EHR-linked biobanks across four medical centers - Columbia, Cornell, Mayo Clinic and Mount Sinai. Our objectives are to (1) develop improved methods for EHR phenotyping of MDD, anxiety, and SUDs, and related outcomes based on a data-set of >30 million EHRs, (2) evaluate associations between PRSs and these conditions, and (3) assess the association between PRSs and outcomes including treatment resistance in MDD and healthcare utilization in patients with MDD, anxiety and SUD. The PRS analyses will utilize data from biobanks with >50,000 persons with both EHR and GWAS data. Successful completion of this study will substantially advance our understanding of the clinical utility of PRSs for commonly occurring psychiatric disorders.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9716663,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,723673,0.10363874496533011
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9790928,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.029846700045833188
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief. These findings may advance understanding of the process of grief, facilitate early identification of high-risk grievers and potentially form the basis for targeted treatment of complicated grief.",Predicting complicated grief from grief processing,9686793,K23MH114021,"['Acute', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Down-Regulation', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Family member', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grief reaction', 'Guilt', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Reaction Time', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Stimulus', 'Suicide', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Trauma', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'intense pain', 'loved ones', 'neural patterning', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'sustained attention', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K23,2019,199800,0.033983351134802636
"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",9808966,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,294653,0.02823604283739665
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9689114,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,353843,0.17104056694470518
"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology. This will contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent the disorder and its progression.",Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk,9813301,R01MH069942,"['21 year old', '3 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age Factors', 'Age-Years', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Family Relationship', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Intercept', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'biobehavior', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'economic cost', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'middle childhood', 'mortality', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'peer', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social media']",NIMH,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,765672,0.032232344962795235
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9903905,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,418818,0.030807142242980153
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9693661,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,5173,0.05037237164607268
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9638873,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2019,843783,0.14623916410096108
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,9658750,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,752187,0.1735237361061882
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,0.04197517079457208
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors. Findings will inform short-term suicide risk prediction and the development of novel just-in-time interventions for individuals at high risk of suicide.",Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction,9806314,K23MH120436,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agitation', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consensus', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guide prevention', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'demographics', 'diaries', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'standard measure', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,198551,0.186814377413956
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9798942,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2019,829290,0.007085051402135738
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9773224,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social deficits', 'social media', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2019,721420,0.16831862363198574
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9679122,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'intersectionality', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social disparities', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,680549,0.05095051159859265
"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Preterm Birth (PTB) is a major long-lasting public health problem being the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates, with heavy emotional and financial consequences to families and society. Prediction of PTB risk has been an exceedingly challenging problem, in particular for first time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. Most studies to date have examined individual risk factors, genetic, environmental, or behavioral, through univariate analyses of their association with PTB, including GWAS identifying modest contribution of common variants across six gene regions. The challenge of improving PTB prediction is due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. We plan on devising longitudinal risk prediction methods for PTB that integrate every piece of available data. We will address three important gaps in current literature as our three project objectives: a focused study of nulliparous women and their risk for PTB; combining genetic factors with other clinical factors to determine risk ; and using longitudinal data and models to optimize scheduling of patient visits, testing and treatment. We will focus on a recently released NIH-NICHD dataset called nuMoM2b, which is a prospective cohort study of a racially/ethnically/geographically diverse  population of10 ,038 nulliparous women with singleton gestation . Our aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction ; (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction ; (3) Assessing the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice. RELEVANCE (See instructions) . Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. n/a",SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women,9928205,R01LM013327,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New York', 'Nulliparity', 'Paper', 'Patient Schedules', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Premature Birth', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Impacts', 'Societies', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'disability', 'genetic association', 'genetic information', 'genome wide association study', 'graduate student', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'minority student', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'non-genetic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'racial and ethnic', 'recruit', 'symposium', 'undergraduate research']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,259112,0.029505943930140204
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,0.060091121925900125
"Smartphone-based digital phenotyping to detect high-risk affect states in body dysmorphic disorder Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with extremely high risk for suicide attempts (22-28%) and substance use disorders (49%), underscoring the critical importance of risk detection in BDD. Negative affect states - particularly anxiety and shame - are well-documented risk factors for suicide and substance use in BDD, offering clear targets for risk detection and intervention. This K23 aims to develop and validate unobtrusive, time-sensitive, and ecologically valid measures of anxiety, shame, and general negative affect states in BDD, using smartphone-based digital phenotyping. Passive (i.e., unobtrusive) smartphone measurement of negative affect states will be based on GPS, accelerometer, and communication logs, used to detect behavioral features of anxiety (avoidance, rituals), shame (social withdrawal, isolation), and general negative affect (aggregated avoidance, rituals, withdrawal, and isolation features). We will collect passive and active (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) smartphone data in 85 adults with BDD and will use EMA ratings of negative affect as outcomes, to build and validate predictive statistical models from passive data. We will also test the hypotheses that passive smartphone measures of negative affect states can significantly predict next-day suicidal ideation and substance use in BDD, above and beyond common clinical indices of risk. This project synthesizes the Candidate’s expertise in emotion-based risk for suicide in BDD with her experience conducting smartphone research. Building from this foundation, this K23 will provide critical new training in key areas to launch the Candidate’s independent research career: (1) digital phenotyping, including statistical learning and longitudinal analysis; (2) EMA methods; (3) assessment of suicide and substance use; (4) career development, including R01 writing; and (5) ethics of technology-based suicide and substance use research. Training goals will be accomplished with stellar mentorship and institutional support at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sabine Wilhelm, a leader in BDD and clinical research, will serve as the primary mentor. Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, an expert in digital phenotyping and its statistical approaches, and Dr. Michael Armey, an expert in EMA research of emotions and suicide, will serve as co-mentors. Complementary guidance in EMA and substance use will be provided by the advisory team: Drs. Bettina Hoeppner and A. Eden Evins. In line with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 will yield scalable, unobtrusive tools to detect acute, modifiable risk factors for suicide and substance use in a high-risk population. Moreover, negative affect states are transdiagnostic risk factors. As a next step to this proof-of- concept K23, the Candidate will apply for an R01 to further validate passive mobile detection of negative affect states and their ability to predict risk transdiagnostically. This program of research can enable (1) personalized just-in-time interventions targeting high-risk affect states, to reduce suicide and substance use; (2) unobtrusive monitoring of changes in risk; and (3) large-scale, ecologically-valid longitudinal research of risk processes.

"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs. This SBIR Fast Track proposal is necessary to keep pace with the burgeoning adoption of electronic patient reported outcomes and EHRs across healthcare and is foundational to the next step of designing better suicide interventions.",Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction,9774940,R44MH118780,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Tests', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Violence', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'brief intervention', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'computerized', 'data visualization', 'design', 'flexibility', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'systematic review', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,ADAPTIVE TESTING TECHNOLOGIES,R44,2019,224998,0.1745113031087581
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt,9824639,R03MH118609,"['Arousal', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Glutamates', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention strategy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'falls', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 5', 'molecular imaging', 'mood regulation', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'radioligand', 'radiotracer', 'reducing suicide', 'relating to nervous system', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'targeted agent', 'translational impact', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,83750,0.1684636416730567
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population,9597913,R21MH115344,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adult', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Community Surveys', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gays', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hate', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterosexuals', 'Homicide', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Sizes', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Services', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'experience', 'gender minority', 'health care availability', 'health disparity', 'illicit drug use', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'men', 'mortality disparity', 'novel', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'screening', 'sexual minority', 'social stigma', 'stressor', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'suicide rate', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'transgender', 'trend', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,185853,0.13692916757534995
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9806213,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2019,193644,0.01613950671845164
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.05658815319385129
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9593921,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,797747,0.1608150437112739
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9593994,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Platelet Factor 4', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,547151,0.16767193577291256
"Addressing Suicide Research Gaps: Understanding Mortality Outcomes in the Mid-Atlantic Region  PROJECTSUMMARY Data linkage offers the potential to improve suicide risk surveillance as well as evaluate and enhance suicide prevention approaches. Data linkage could also allow for the identification of novel predictors or combinations of predictors to improve precision medicine efforts. The ability to access and analyze health care data has expanded dramatically in the past decade. The goal of this application is to leverage data from multiple sources including hospital discharges, insurance claims, death investigations, health information exchanges, and administrative data (e.g., civil status, employment status, legal system involvement, neighborhood characteristics, unemployment, gun ownership, arrests and incarceration). Aggregating these data systems will allow for novel secondary data analyses, which will enhance our understanding of risk and protective processes on suicide death in the Mid-Atlantic region. The aims of this project include identifying and merging existing clinical data sources (e.g., medical examiner, claims, hospital discharges), geo-level data sources and other clinical data (e.g., built environment, electronic health records), and aggregated administrative data (e.g., school, incarceration, gun ownership). Our team will develop predictive models using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. These models will be enhanced using spatial algorithms to detect the geo-clustering of suicide. The generalizability of data sources and analytic methods will be tested in the Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia) to evaluate data availability, quality and data linkage feasibility. The methods of this project will be shared as a resource with other states and regions to establish a similar analytics framework to advance suicide prevention. Our team will develop national guidelines and technical support materials to facilitate data linkage and analysis based on common data sources available in most states. The project will offer essential benchmarks and measures for providers and payers to reduce suicide events in their systems.  PUBLICHEALTHRELEVANCE Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Over 44,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2015 and rates have increased 24% since 1999.

"Enhancing and extending the reach of suicide surveillance in tribal communities PROJECT SUMMARY The parent grant “Southwest Hub for American Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Research” (U19 MH113136-01) aims to develop and test culturally appropriate prevention strategies, conduct outreach and dissemination within and across tribal communities, and enable key stakeholders to make science-based policy and related decisions. The overall goal is to leverage a collaborative network of tribal leaders, investigators, interventionalists, service providers and service users in the Southwest region to reduce suicide in American Indian youth ages 10-24. An administrative supplement is requested in order to build on our existing data collection platform to be more scalable and efficient when used across tribal settings. In collaboration with colleagues at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, we will set up the data collection platform to incorporate additional sites and capitalize on preliminary machine learning work to create easily interpretable risk flags that can help case-managers prioritize cases to reach and connect to care. This work will contribute to a better understanding of how to scale community based m-health platforms for use across diverse settings and how to operationalize and implement machine learning algorithms to help improve care. PROJECT NARRATIVE By strengthening the existing m-health suicide surveillance and case-management platform in the parent grant, these supplementary activities will pave the way for scale-up and enhancement of the system with novel risk detection methods across tribal settings.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9543193,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,798597,0.10363874496533011
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9540118,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,0.029846700045833188
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9471878,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,360343,0.17104056694470518
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9485199,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58392,0.026182719309024695
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma.

"Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Title: Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses Project Summary  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Risk assessment of influenza viruses is a key component in pandemic influenza preparedness (PIP), and it can help optimize resources for influenza surveillance, vaccine development and other control measurements to help minimize losses due to an emerging influenza virus. Risk assessment of influenza viruses includes emergence risk and public health impact of novel influenza viruses. Emergence risk assesses the probability for a novel influenza virus to infect and easily spread among humans; it is the first risk to be evaluated in risk assessment.  Although a number of individual mutations or structural/functional motifs have been reported to be associated with influenza infection and transmission, their effects on emergence risk are difficult to predict a priori. Thus, conventional methods for assessment of the emergence risk of a novel IAV often require laboratory generation of reassortants and subsequent measurement of their infectivity, pathogenesis, and transmission, which is often done in a mammalian system. However, this strategy can lead to laboratory mutants with gain of function (i.e., mutants with new or enhanced activity on pathogenesis and/or transmissibility in mammals). Thus, an ideal system for influenza risk assessment should be able to quantify emergence risk for a novel IAV solely by using genomic sequences.  Avian influenza A viruses facilitated the emergence of all four known pandemic human influenza A viruses: the hemagglutinin genes of 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic viruses are all of avian origin, and the polymerase PB2 and PA genes of the 2009 pandemic virus are of avian origin. Risk assessment of potential reassortants from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses has been a key component of the pandemic influenza preparedness process.  The objectives of this study are to develop and validate a machine learning method to assess the emergence risk for a novel IAV using genomic sequences. The study will focus on emergence risk from contemporary endemic human influenza viruses and enzootic avian influenza viruses. We expect to identify genetic features within and across gene segments and ascertain their synergistic effects as emergence risk determinants. We also expect to develop a computational model for estimating the probability of a possible reassortant to emerge, given the genomic sequences of one human influenza virus and one avian influenza virus. The study results should help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and with assessing emergence risk of influenza virus; thus, the results should facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness. Project Narrative This project will develop a computational model for influenza risk assessment, and it will help with understanding the fundamental mechanisms for genetic reassortment and for assessing the emergence risk of influenza viruses, and thus the project will facilitate pandemic influenza preparedness.",Risk Assessment of Influenza A Viruses,9599007,R21AI135820,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Birds', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Funding', 'Gene Combinations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Reassortant Viruses', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cost', 'enzootic', 'flu transmission', 'gain of function', 'genetic variant', 'in vivo', 'influenza surveillance', 'influenzavirus', 'learning strategy', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'transmission process', 'vaccine development', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,181875,0.05037237164607268
"Suicide Death Among Older Adults Receiving Residential Long-term Care Project Summary/Abstract  Suicide is among the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. and suicide risk increases substantially after age 65. Nearly 70% of individuals currently 65 years old will require long-term care during the remainder of their lives. The nation's 15,000 nursing homes are an important setting providing residential post-acute and long-term care to over 3 million older and disabled Americans every year, and the nation's 30,000 assisted living facilities provided a home to about 800,000 elders during 2013-14. Residents in the 2 types of long-term care facilities are often socially isolated, physically and cognitively disabled, and diagnosed with multiple mental and medical conditions, all of which are associated with suicide in older adults. As a result, they may show elevated risk taking their own lives compared to community-living elders despite the fact that long-term care facilities are able to monitor closely the daily activities of their residents. However, the actual suicide risk among these residents is largely unknown. Moreover, it is expected that organizational characteristics and overall ability of long-term care facilities to provide safe and high quality of care play an important role in shaping the risk of suicide for residents at different points of care. However, empirical evidence on these questions is extremely limited. This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, estimate suicide risk for nursing home residents at different points of care using longitudinal resident assessment records, and determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate. Organizational characteristics will be measured by nursing home structural factors (e.g. profit status), overall quality of care (e.g. measured by nurse staffing level), and organizational-level patient safety culture. This project will link the longitudinal National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and National Death Index (NDI) files to nursing home Minimum Data Sets (MDS) and Medicare beneficiary data, as well as other facility and state policy files. These data will be used to model resident risk for suicide death using cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods, quantify the variations in risk-adjusted suicide death rates at different levels (i.e. facility, region, and state levels), and test the hypotheses regarding organizational and policy impacts on suicide death. The information generated in this project will contribute to the knowledge of suicide burdens among the most vulnerable elders in need of residential long-term care. The knowledge gained will inform future organizational- and policy-level interventions to prevent suicide among elders receiving long-term care. Project Narrative This study proposes to evaluate systematically the risk for suicide mortality among nursing home and assisted living residents, and to determine the associations of organizational characteristics and state policies with risk-adjusted suicide death rate.

"MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period Project Summary/Abstract Background: Preterm births, those that occur prior to 37 weeks of gestation, are the leading direct cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. More than 1 in 9 births in the U.S. are preterm, with rates that are disproportionately high among African-Americans and families living in poverty, regardless of race. Addressing the problem of preterm birth requires both accurate identification of the factors that put women at risk, and communication of that risk to women and their healthcare providers. The reduction in preterm births is a core mission of the NICHD Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch. Study aims: 1) Apply our novel machine learning algorithm, KCI-neighbors, to a large prospective cohort study to model adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with low income and English literacy, 2) use mixed-methods research, grounded in decision science techniques, to tailor the MyHealthyPregnancy (MHP) app to the specific needs of low income and low English literacy patients, and 3) conduct small- scale usability testing of the modified technology with a sample of peripartum low-income, low-literacy patients to determine the app's acceptability and interested in targeted intervention strategies. Innovation: MHP is the first mobile health app that combines machine learning, expert models, and behavioral decision research to provide pregnant women and their providers scientifically sound, highly personalized, and actionable feedback on individual-level risk. The machine learning algorithms are designed to learn from users as the app is more widely deployed, allowing for the identification of new causal pathways linking risk factors to adverse pregnancy outcomes. MHP targets specific engagement metrics (e.g. appointment attendance) to meet health system stakeholders' goals, enabling healthcare systems to meet performance targets, as well as decrease costs through reduced adverse outcomes. Methodology and expected results: We will employ statistical machine learning to model the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, complemented by qualitative mixed-methods research to identify the most important measures to include in the MHP app. We anticipate that usability-testing will show an engaging app, capable of capturing and communicating risks in our target population. Potential impact: This work will advance scientific understanding of the risk factors, needs, and implementation science required to reach pregnant women who experience the most difficulty engaging in the healthcare system. Moreover, it will help improve clinical practice through development of a tool, MHP, that can detect and communicate preterm birth precursor risk to both patients and providers. Project Narrative Preterm birth affects millions of families in the United States, with severe health consequences for surviving infants and their families. Determining the factors that put individual women at greatest risk, and communicating those factors in a decision-relevant manner, requires a deep understanding of the patient population. The proposed research integrates individual-level interviews from women in a low income and low English literacy population, with novel statistical machine learning algorithms and a user-centered design approach, to deliver a personalized, engaging, and effective pregnancy risk communication mobile health application: MyHealthyPregnancy.",MyHealthyPregnancy mobile health app: Combining behavioral science and machine learning for risk communication during the peripartum period,9681309,R43DP006417,[' '],NCCDPHP,"NAIMA HEALTH, LLC",R43,2018,224843,0.02946574178522453
"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9593182,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Generic Drugs', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,466099,0.030807142242980153
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9489301,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral study', 'biological heterogeneity', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,482739,0.13806723059297132
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9579491,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social media', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2018,808067,0.16831862363198574
"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population,9436443,R21MH115344,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adult', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Community Surveys', 'Comorbidity', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gays', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Hate', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Heterosexuals', 'Homicide', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Population Sizes', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Services', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Suggestion', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'experience', 'gender minority', 'health disparity', 'illicit drug use', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'men', 'mortality disparity', 'novel', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial difference', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'screening', 'sexual minority', 'social stigma', 'stressor', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'suicide rate', 'theories', 'transgender', 'trend', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,224074,0.13692916757534995
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9551054,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,184819,0.05073224996025945
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9463479,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'recruit', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2018,398926,0.03130212731740816
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),9452111,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2018,623678,0.1585646781802451
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,0.060091121925900125
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9315225,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biometry', 'Case Series', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,296515,0.17104056694470518
"Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman’s health as well as adversely impact her infant’s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors—advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery—and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity—saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year, more and more new mothers are diagnosed with serious pregnancy-related medical conditions, particularly mothers who identify as racial/ethnic minorities. Research is urgently needed to understand what is driving this alarming problem and what puts women most at risk so future research can be conducted to guide interventions and clinical care for childbearing women.","Understanding Severe Maternal Morbidity: Predictors, Trends, and Disparities",9327774,F32HD091945,"['Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Birth', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Censuses', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cesarean section', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal Age', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Maternal Physiology', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patient Discharge', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Population Study', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Vital Statistics', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'advanced maternal age', 'base', 'child bearing', 'clinical care', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic minority population', 'improved', 'indexing', 'maternal morbidity', 'outcome prediction', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'social', 'trend']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,56334,0.026182719309024695
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments.

"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individual’s attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalists’ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9390299,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,231830,0.05073224996025945
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9250195,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2017,398926,0.03130212731740816
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),9228391,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2017,633460,0.1585646781802451
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,0.060091121925900125
"Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicide prevention is a significant public health priority. We have made great strides in understanding risk factors for suicidal behavior using conventional statistical methods; however prediction of suicidal behavior in practice remains poor. In 2014, NIMH and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Research Prioritization Task Force published A Prioritized Research Agenda for Suicide Prevention: An Action Plan to Save Lives, which identified six key unanswered questions about suicide. The proposed project addresses the key unanswered question of ""how can we better or more optimally detect/predict risk?"" from the report. Specifically, the project addresses the following short and long term objectives associated with this unanswered question: (1) developing risk algorithms from health care data that can be used for suicide risk detection and (2) overcoming base rate challenges and response bias by identifying innovative biostatistical and other research methods. Recent advances in statistical methodology, including the application of machine learning methods in psychiatry, will allow us to capitalize on what has been learned from previous studies to propel forward our ability to predict suicidal behavior. The aims of this study are to examine immediate and long-term risk factors of three separate suicidal behavior outcomes including (a) suicidal ideation, (b) suicide attempt and (c) death from suicide to develop general population risk algorithms and elucidate novel interactions, both overall and among high risk subgroups. Further, we will use regression-based analyses to quantify the main effects of predictor variables and novel interactions. Study Design: This series of case-control studies will use machine learning to identify risk algorithms for suicidal behavior in the population of Denmark from 1994-2015. Extensive data on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, prescriptions, social variables, and mortality have been routinely and rapidly recorded in national registries in Denmark for decades, allowing for the thorough examination of longitudinal predictors and the efficient examination of low base rate outcomes. Gender differences will be explored, as well as algorithms among high risk subgroups of the population (e.g., groups with psychiatric diagnoses). Implications: The current study addresses NIMH's research priorities of 1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and 2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH- supported research. This work will inform clinicians and policymakers regarding the patient groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts. In future work, risk algorithms developed as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools that can identify patients at risk for suicidal behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This expansive general population study will inform policymakers and public health practitioners about the groups that may benefit most from both universal and selected suicide intervention and prevention efforts (i.e., what characteristic combinations confer the greatest risk for suicidal behavior among general population and high risk subgroups). In future work, risk algorithms discovered as part of this study can be validated in other populations, used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered interactions that increase suicidal behavior risk, and ultimately develop deployable screening tools.        ",Risk Profiles for Suicidal Behavior in the General Population,9080772,R01MH109507,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Denmark', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Research', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social support', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'demographics', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'social', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,321827,0.17104056694470518
"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,9115234,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'aged', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral study', 'biological heterogeneity', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,488490,0.13806723059297132
"Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will investigate the following hypothesis: that the quantification of geometric surrogates, which predict the ensuing peak wall rupture risk index (PWRRI), will provide an improved estimate of aneurysm rupture risk compared to the clinical standard of maximum aneurysm diameter. We thus propose the highly innovative use of both radiological and non-radiological clinical imaging to develop a computational tool that can assess AAA risk of rupture with greater accuracy than the current clinical standard. Such a tool will allow the accurate quantification of individual AAA geometry to achieve the main goal of the study, which is to identify the patient-specific AAA geometry characteristics that are surrogates for patient-specific PWRRI. In the proposed approach, we will first compute a truly individualized PWRRI based on an innovative method called image-based Vascular Mechanical Characterization technology (iV-MeCh). The geometry characteristics highly correlated with PWRRI will be considered the surrogates of this biomechanics-based index. A second phase of the study will be the validation of the surrogates with actual clinical outcomes, which will yield the accurate predictors of rupture. This approach, devoid of complex finite element modeling and based on a fast, nearly automated computational tool for geometry quantification, would provide an exceptional rationale for the need for surgical intervention and be of major clinical significance. Therefore, the following specific aims are to be completed during the project period to address the aforementioned hypothesis: (1) Validate iV-MeCh for estimating patient-specific spatio-temporal AAA wall stress; (2) Calculate individual PWRRI using iV-MeCh for high and low risk of rupture AAA; (3) Identify the individual geometry characteristics that are surrogates of PWRRI; and (4) Assess the clinical significance of geometric surrogates for the prediction of AAA rupture risk. The primary outcome of this research will be the ability to disambiguate or demystify rupture risk in AAA for which the standard of care (maximum diameter) is not an accurate metric for assessing their at-risk condition. The geometric surrogates of PWRRI are hypothesized to reduce false positives and false negatives compared to the conventional maximum diameter cut-off for recommending elective repair. In addition, PWRRI is predicted by means of a new, novel technique (iV-MeCh), which estimates wall stress in aneurysms by means of non-radiological clinical imaging and without the use of constitutive soft tissue mechanics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This award will enable the validation of computational tools for non-invasively predicting the at-risk condition of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) based on the assessment of aneurysm geometry. This research is expected to impact the clinical management of AAA disease, as well as the pre-surgical planning capabilities of vascular and endovascular aneurysm repair.",Geometric Surrogates for Clinical Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,9041015,R01HL121293,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Aneurysm', 'Award', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'pressure', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'repaired', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2016,474831,0.03130212731740816
"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),9033159,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'abstracting', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population health', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2016,605980,0.1585646781802451
"Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to use cutting-edge statistical methods to develop clinically-useful (1) risk algorithms to identify who is at greatest risk of developing different internalizing disorders, and (2) subtypes of internalizing disorders that identify who is most likely to experience a persistence and chronic long-term disorder course. This research has important clinical and public health implications. With this research, individuals at risk of developing internalizing disorders can be targeted using early detection and prevention efforts, while those at risk of experiencing a persistent and chronic long-term course can be targeted using tailored/intensive internalizing disorder interventions.",Developing Risk Algorithms of Internalizing Disorder Etiology and Course,9376539,K01MH106710,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Baseline Surveys', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Surveys', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stressful Event', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'course development', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'phase 1 study', 'population based', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'salivary assay', 'skills', 'theories', 'willingness']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),K01,2016,166902,0.037961558891100956
"Novel whole-genome analysis methods for Alzheimer's risk prediction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) affects millions of elderly people in the United States, yet there are no well-established clinical guidelines for assessing a person's relative risk. Accurate assessment of lifetime risk for LOAD would give high-risk individuals the opportunity to undergo regular biomarker screening for signs of disease and to modify environmental risk factors or participate in prospective clinical trials. This Phase I SBIR project aims to develop a risk prediction model for LOAD that meets or exceeds the accuracy standards established in 1998 by the Working Group for Biochemical and Molecular Markers of Alzheimer's Disease. The recent release of whole-genome sequence data from an extensively phenotyped cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative creates a unique opportunity to develop the methodology needed to successfully construct such a risk prediction model. The Parabon team will undertake three specific aims in pursuit of the final goal of producing a risk prediction model that can be used in the clinic. First, a novel methodology will be created for analyzing whole-genome sequence data to discover common SNPs, rare variants, and epistatic interactions that significantly associate with LOAD endophenotypes, the specific physiological changes that underlie disease. This will require innovative algorithm and software development, particularly the implementation of multi-objective optimization in our existing evolutionary search algorithm for detecting epistasis. Second, the discovered significant variants will be built into risk prediction models for each endophenotype using state-of-the-art machine learning methods. These models will then be combined into a single predictive model for lifetime risk, which will be validated in an independent cohort from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Finally, to quantify the confidence associated with each prediction made by the model, algorithms and software for calculating confidence intervals will be developed and implemented. Each new prediction will be presented with a measure of confidence to enable clinicians to determine what, if any, intervention is necessary. When these aims have been completed, Parabon will have produced the first clinically relevant genetic risk prediction model for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease, as well as a suite of software that can be used in the development of other diagnostics. In Phase II, we will move beyond the ADNI-supplied endophenotypes, using image processing and deep learning to infer neuroimaging features most relevant to AD diagnoses, as well as work to validate the predictive models in a larger, more diverse cohort across multiple sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This Phase I SBIR aims to develop a highly accurate predictive model for lifetime risk of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease to enable early identification of high-risk individuals for participation in clinical trials and regular screening for signs of disease.

"Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult suicide rates in the United States rose by almost 30 percent between 1999 and 2010. These rates have not markedly improved in decades. To date, previous suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses are largely the only known clinical risk factors for suicide death. Recent research shows that most individuals who die by suicide make a health care visit in the weeks and months prior to their death. Most of these visits occur in primary care or outpatient medical specialty settings. However, over half of these visits do not include a psychiatric diagnosis. Thus, there is limited evidence available from health care users in the US general population to inform targeted suicide screening and risk identification efforts in general medical settings. New research is needed to investigate the general medical clinical factors associated with suicide risk among individuals without a known risk factor. This research project uses data on more than 4000 individuals who died by suicide and made health care visits to one of eight health care systems across the United States in the year prior to their death. These health systems are members of the Mental Health Research Network and have affiliated health plans. They are able to capture nearly all health care for their patients via the Virtual Data Warehouse (VDW). The VDW consists of electronic medical record and insurance claims data organized using standardized data structures and definitions across sites. These data are matched with official regional mortality data. This project includes the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the types and timing of clinical factors prior to suicide, 2a) Compare clinical factors before suicide to a matched sample of health care users, 2b) Detect associations between additional clinical factors and suicide, 3) Develop a prediction model of clinical factors prior to suicide, and 4) investigate indicators of hidden mental health need in general medical chart notes prior to suicide. We employ a case-control study approach to test specific hypotheses, while also using novel environment-wide association study methods and latent class analysis to detect new risk factors. We develop a prediction model of clinical factors and suicide. We use qualitative analyses to review clinical text notes and develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify risk. Clinical factors to be studied include medical diagnoses, medications, health care procedures, and types of health care visits. These results will inform decisions about how to focus suicide prevention in medical settings and provide information in response to the 2012 National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention and US Surgeon General report.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most individuals who die by suicide make general medical visits prior to their death, but do not have a documented mental health condition. The proposed R01 project uses data from eight Mental Health Research Network affiliated health systems across the U.S. to investigate the association between other, non-psychiatric clinical factors, including medical diagnoses, medications, procedures, and types of visits and suicide risk. Evidence from this study can be used to inform the development of targeted suicide prevention efforts in general medical settings.                ",Treatment Utilization Before Suicide (TUBS),8815759,R01MH103539,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Planning', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Case-Control Study', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosa', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surgeon', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'abstracting', 'case control', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical risk', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'treatment duration', 'trend', 'virtual', 'years of life lost']",NIMH,HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM,R01,2015,707635,0.1585646781802451
"Novel Tree-based Statistical Methods for Cancer Risk Prediction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The contradiction of early cancer detection is that while some benefit others receive a detrimental diagnosis. A definitive example is mammography and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a noninvasive breast cancer. DCIS, which most frequently presents as a non-palpable lesion, was rarely detected before the advent of modern mammography. Since 1983 there has been a 290% increase in DCIS incidence in women under 50 and 500% in those over 50. Given that only 5-10% of DCIS cases progress to invasive cancer with a 10-year mortality rate of 1-2%, DCIS experts suggest breast conservation for the majority of patients. However, these women continue to be overtreated with mastectomy and radiation, at rates comparable to those with invasive cancer. The inability to discern those at low vs. high risk is due in part to non-reproducible study results as well as inadequate statistical methods for risk prediction and validation.  We have collected a population-based DCIS cohort with the goal of delineating those women least likely to recur with invasive cancer and, hence, appropriate candidates for less aggressive treatments. Recently we established risk indices and published the corresponding absolute risk estimates for type of recurrence. However, two features of the study design, namely the presence of competing risks and the use of a stratified case-cohort design, constrained us to using crude empirical methods for analysis and left us unable to validate the clinical utility of our models. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a unified, principled statistical framework for building, selecting, and evaluating clinically relevant risk indices, permitting refinement and validation of existing risk prediction models in our DCIS study as well as beyond.  We face multiple challenges including how to objectively build risk indices with relevant variables; how to estimate the corresponding risks (competing or not) in various subsample study designs; and, how to validate the resulting risk prediction models. Recently, we developed partDSA, a tree-based method which affords tremendous flexibility in building predictive models and provides an ideal foundation for developing a clinician- friendly tool for accurate stratification and risk prediction. In its curret form, partDSA is unable to estimate absolute risk in the presence of competing risks accounting for subsample study designs. Here we extend partDSA for such clinically relevant scenarios (Aim 1). We also propose aggregate learning for risk prediction to increase prediction accuracy and subsequently to build more stable but easily interpretable risk models (Aim 2). Finally, we propose the necessary methods for validating the resulting models (Aim 3).  Our proposal has two immediate public health benefits: first, these novel statistical methods will result in a clinician-friendly, publicly available tool for accurate risk prediction, stratification and validaion in numerous clinical settings; second, current DCIS risk models will be refined and validated with the expectation of better delineating those at low risk, hence strong candidates for conservative treatments including active surveillance.

"Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of a four-year study of cognitive markers of late-life suicide. Our overarching goal is to find factors predictive of high-lethality suicidal behavior in late life. Extending the stress-diathesis model, our research program seeks to understand how trait-like diatheses - impaired cognitive control, deficits in social processing, and impulsivity - are expressed in poor decisions, both in experimental paradigms and in the context of real-world decision making. Our current cross-sectional study focuses on cognitive correlates of late-life suicidal behavior, linking it to poor cognitive contro. Adding to a growing body of evidence, we have preliminary evidence that older suicide attempters are impaired in their decision-making. Further, we have important clues about dimensions of heterogeneity in suicidal behavior. We see that high-lethality suicide attempters struggle in complex environments and make poor social decisions. By contrast, we see a tendency toward short-sighted decisions falling under the broad category of impulsivity in people with low-lethality and unplanned suicide attempts. The proposed study examines the cognitive and neural underpinnings of disadvantageous decisions in individuals with high-lethality attempts. We propose to (i) relate cognitive control deficits to poor decision-making in complex, ambiguous environments in older suicide attempters, (ii) to describe neural system alterations that may underlie poor cognitive control and disadvantageous decisions, (iii) to extend our investigations to poor social decisions that may contribute to late-life suicidal behavior, and (iv to develop an algorithm for predicting suicide risk that incorporates these features in addition to established risk factors. These goals will be accomplished by two interlinked studies. Study I is a cross-sectional, case- control comparison of 70 high-lethality suicide attempters, 70 low-lethality suicide attempters, 70 non-suicidal depressed, and 50 non-psychiatric controls. We focus on older suicide attempters, as suicide rates are high in old age and because late-life suicide attempts, due to their serious and determined nature, offer a window into death by suicide. Study I will use a framework that combines behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience, with multilevel clinical, behavioral, cognitive, and imaging assessments. Our sampling and assessment strategy was designed with particular attention to possible confounders. Study II will follow 250 older suicide attempters (110 enrolled to date + 140 newly recruited) for up to 4 years, capturing recurrent attempts. It will serve as a prospective validatin of our predictive model. The extensive clinical and behavioral/cognitive characterization combined with a machine learning approach will allow us to develop an algorithm for suicide risk prediction which can inform clinical practice. The investigative team includes experts in reward learning and model-based imaging (Dombrovski), geriatric neuroimaging (Aizeinstein), behavioral economics (De Bruine), analysis of neural and longitudinal data (Weissfield), decision neuroscience (Clark), neuropsychology of suicide (Keilp) and of geriatric depression (Butters).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Every year, about 6000 people aged 65 and older die by suicide in the US, with non-fatal suicide attempts numbering at least 2-4 times as many; however, clinicians lack tools for identifying those at risk and targeted treatments. Suicide follows a decision process, and recent studies have shown that suicidal individuals are often bad at making decisions in other situations; this study specifically explores patterns of decision-making seen in older people with near-lethal suicide attempts.            ",Decision Processes of Late-Life Suicide,8630165,R01MH085651,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Butter', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Dimensions', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Vision', 'aged', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'case control', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'geriatric depression', 'indexing', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,496314,0.13806723059297132

"A New Hip Fracture Risk Prediction Tool Based on Common Predictors and Hip Geomer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. Women are at a particularly high risk for osteoporosis and 50% of women age 50 or older may suffer from a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetime. Hip fractures are the most detrimental type of fractures. Research has been conducted to assess hip fracture risk so prevention methods could be used to reduce this risk in the growing number of older women. However, previous risk assessment approaches are limited to a few variables and linear combinations of these factors. Also, there is an increasing number of available measures, such as bone structures and skeletal muscle mass, that can be extracted, for instance, from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and no reliable risk prediction model exist based on this wealth of information. The overall goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive and flexible model to assess the risk of hip fracture for a specific woman. This will be achieved by constructing a novel predictor that classifies data that include hip structural geometry, sarcopenia measurements as well as risk factors identified in previous studies. The construction of the predictive model will be partly based on a study conducted among a large (n = 11,432) multi-ethnic bone cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI). In addition, to enhance the quality of the risk prediction, computational data from finite element simulations will be used. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to generate a risk model, based on clinical data that accounts for the coupling effects of the factors involved in hip fracture. This research introduces a new approach in the field of hip fracture, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which explicitly identifies the configurations of factors that are likely to lead to hip fracture. The second aim is to refine the prediction/decision model from the first aim using both the SVM classifier and finite element modeling. A scheme has been developed to select, in a high dimensional space, data points that would improve the accuracy of the SVM-based risk prediction model. These data points would be evaluated (fracture or not) using a finite element model. The novelty of the proposed finite element model stems from its full parameterization so that the variability of the bone response can be studied with respect to variations (even small) of structural geometry and material parameters. The third aim is to validate and compare the SVM-based risk with and without the use of finite element analysis and develop a hip fracture risk calculator for the web. A cross validation will be performed using data sets from the WHI as well as other cohorts. The flexibility of the SVM classification approach makes it easily deployable on the Internet. This study will be carried out using existing cohorts by an interdisciplinary team with experience in epidemiology of osteoporosis research, DXA measurements including hip structures and sarcopenia, fracture assessments, biostatistics approaches for large datasets, high dimensional analysis and finite element modeling, thus making this study highly feasible. The study results will have an extremely significant public health impact by providing an innovative tool for hip fracture risk assessments.        This study will use innovative approaches, existing cohort resources, and interdisciplinary expertise to address a significant public health challenge: assessing the risk of hip fracture, the most detrimental type of fragility fractures. The study aims for a better risk assessment tool on the web that can be used by researchers and clinicians to assess an individual's hip fracture risk. This research will test new predictors and use the assumption free modeling approach to capture complex and non-linear relationships of predictors with fracture risk. This research is significant for reducing fracture burdens in the large and growing U.S. older women population.

"Longitudinal Assessment of Fall Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falling is not a normal part of the aging process and yet 1/3 to 1/2 of adults 65 years and older sustain at least one fall annually. Older adults are hospitalized for fall related injuries five times more often than from injuries from other causes contributing to a cost of $19 billion for nonfatal falls in the United States. Projected for the increasing aging population in the year 2020, it is expected that the costs related to falls will reach a staggering 54.9 billion dollars. Current research and clinical practice guidelines focus on multifactorial fall risk assessments as the critical deterrent to falls in the elderly. A primary factor within these assessments is activity of daily living performance of the individual elder. While current standardized clinical balance assessment tools have been proven effective for predicting fall risk, the tests are most commonly performed in the clinical environment and at isolated times during an individual's day. The goal of this application is to develop and validate a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. Such a device: - will allow early detection of risk of falling, when therapeutic interventions are most efficient - will provide real-time feedback about activity pattern - will provide feedback about compliance with interventions and effectiveness of interventions - will be incorporated into conventional footwear and require no extra effort to operate - can be used in research, clinical and potentially in consumer applications The development of the ALARM system will be addressed in three specific aims:  Specific Aims 1: Develop a pattern recognition method that will improve recognition accuracy for activities of interest (such as walking and stepping up) by reducing the range of variation from current 76%- 100% to 9911%. Specific Aim 2: Collect data using the ALARM device on a group of elderly adults during clinical tests. Specific Aim 3: Develop algorithms for automatic assessment of risk of falling. In this Aim we will develop signal processing algorithms that automatically evaluate metrics indicative of the risk of falling in each activity of interest (e.g. duration of swing and stance phase during walking). Specific Aim 4: Validate the ALARM device in a double-blind unrestricted free living study. This set of Specific Aims will validate lead to creation of a unique wearable device capable of objective characterization of risk of falling.        This application aims at development of a novel wearable device (Automatic Longitudinal Assessment Risk Monitor - ALARM) for longitudinal assessment of risk of falling. In our previous research we have shown that major activities and posture allocations such as standing, sitting, walking, etc. can be recognized with high degree of accuracy (76%-100%) by a wearable device incorporated into conventional footwear. We also have shown that sensor signals captured by the wearable shoe device during activities such as walking are well- correlated with the risk of falling (with numerical estimates of risk obtained through signal processing being directly proportional to the normalized scores from the clinical tests).

"A New Hip Fracture Risk Prediction Tool Based on Common Predictors and Hip Geomer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. Women are at a particularly high risk for osteoporosis and 50% of women age 50 or older may suffer from a fragility fracture in their remaining lifetime. Hip fractures are the most detrimental type of fractures. Research has been conducted to assess hip fracture risk so prevention methods could be used to reduce this risk in the growing number of older women. However, previous risk assessment approaches are limited to a few variables and linear combinations of these factors. Also, there is an increasing number of available measures, such as bone structures and skeletal muscle mass, that can be extracted, for instance, from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and no reliable risk prediction model exist based on this wealth of information. The overall goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive and flexible model to assess the risk of hip fracture for a specific woman. This will be achieved by constructing a novel predictor that classifies data that include hip structural geometry, sarcopenia measurements as well as risk factors identified in previous studies. The construction of the predictive model will be partly based on a study conducted among a large (n = 11,432) multi-ethnic bone cohort from the nationwide Women's Health Initiative (WHI). In addition, to enhance the quality of the risk prediction, computational data from finite element simulations will be used. There are three specific aims. The first aim is to generate a risk model, based on clinical data that accounts for the coupling effects of the factors involved in hip fracture. This research introduces a new approach in the field of hip fracture, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which explicitly identifies the configurations of factors that are likely to lead to hip fracture. The second aim is to refine the prediction/decision model from the first aim using both the SVM classifier and finite element modeling. A scheme has been developed to select, in a high dimensional space, data points that would improve the accuracy of the SVM-based risk prediction model. These data points would be evaluated (fracture or not) using a finite element model. The novelty of the proposed finite element model stems from its full parameterization so that the variability of the bone response can be studied with respect to variations (even small) of structural geometry and material parameters. The third aim is to validate and compare the SVM-based risk with and without the use of finite element analysis and develop a hip fracture risk calculator for the web. A cross validation will be performed using data sets from the WHI as well as other cohorts. The flexibility of the SVM classification approach makes it easily deployable on the Internet. This study will be carried out using existing cohorts by an interdisciplinary team with experience in epidemiology of osteoporosis research, DXA measurements including hip structures and sarcopenia, fracture assessments, biostatistics approaches for large datasets, high dimensional analysis and finite element modeling, thus making this study highly feasible. The study results will have an extremely significant public health impact by providing an innovative tool for hip fracture risk assessments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use innovative approaches, existing cohort resources, and interdisciplinary expertise to address a significant public health challenge: assessing the risk of hip fracture, the most detrimental type of fragility fractures. The study aims for a better risk assessment tool on the web that can be used by researchers and clinicians to assess an individual's hip fracture risk. This research will test new predictors and use the assumption free modeling approach to capture complex and non-linear relationships of predictors with fracture risk. This research is significant for reducing fracture burdens in the large and growing U.S. older women population.           This study will use innovative approaches, existing cohort resources, and interdisciplinary expertise to address a significant public health challenge: assessing the risk of hip fracture, the most detrimental type of fragility fractures.

"Statistical Methods for Predicting Sucicide Attempt    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award has been submitted with the goal of supporting the development of the applicant's career as a quantitative researcher in psychiatry. The training and research plan is intended to build on the candidate's prior work in the statistical analysis of clinical, biological and gene expression data on mood disorders. The application delineates plans for training and mentoring in the areas of biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical diagnoses and neurobiology of depression, and genomic analysis necessary to enable the applicant to pursue an independent career of scientific inquiry in psychiatric statistics. These goals will be met by a combination of supervision and didactic course work in the Division of Neuroscience of the Department of Psychiatry of Columbia University. The aim of the Research Plan is to develop and evaluate efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of suicide attempts and completed suicides in patients with mood disorders. For the purposes of this study, suicide attempt will be defined as a self-destructive act with at least some intent to end one's life. The focus will be on developing and evaluating predictive models based on a large number of retrospective and longitudinal measurements on each subject, as opposed to identification of individual risk factors. Aim 1 proposes to build/evaluate classification models for suicide attempters/nonattempters based on complete data. Aim 2 will build/evaluate survival analysis models when some of the subjects have censored data. Aim 3 will concentrate on classification of post-mortem brain samples from suicide victims and normal controls as a method of identifying putative risk factors for suicidal behavior. This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls. Relevance: Suicide causes over 30,000 deaths annually in the USA, and the number of suicide attempts is thought to be at least several times that.

"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

This will include large-scale gene expression analysis as well as the analysis of receptor bindings and other biochemical information in suicide victims and normal controls. Relevance: Suicide causes over 30,000 deaths annually in the USA, and the number of suicide attempts is thought to be at least several times that. The aim of this study is to develop and compare efficient and flexible statistical methodology for the prediction of future suicide attempts based on demographic, clinical and biological data tor the use of health professionals so that patients at risk for suicide can be identified and treated in advance.           n/a",Statistical Methods for Predicting Suicide Attempt,7644438,K25MH074068,"['Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hospitalization', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'interest', 'meetings', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'receptor binding', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'statistics', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'suicide victim']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K25,2009,129546,0.14888381597392686
"The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This competing renewal application requests five years of support for the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders (CCNMD): The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior. The Surgeon General notes, that 30,000 suicides per year in the United States and ten times that number of suicide attempts, requires a response that involves improving our knowledge regarding the relative importance of multiple predictors of suicide risk. The CCNMD employs a multidisciplinary approach to develop a predictive and explanatory model for suicidal behavior. Project 1: In the brainstem of depressed suicides we have found more serotonin neurons, more TPH, less serotonin transporter expression and 5-HT1A binding, all effects that enhance activity. The brainstem changes may be a response to less serotonin input and lower neurodensity in ventral prefrontal cortex of suicide and that may underlie increased impulsivity and suicide risk. We plan to map the circuitry of suicide by adding studies of anterior cingulate and amygdala, and to study neuron survival in prefrontal cortex. Project 2: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome in the same brain regions as Project 1 will map altered gene expression and be compared to murine models in Projects 6 and 7. Project 3: CCNMD investigators have successfully tested a predictive stress-diathesis model where suicidal ideation is a proximal predictor and lifetime aggressivity/impulsivity is a trait predictor of suicide attempts in major depression. We now propose to evaluate potential causal factors (genes and adverse childhood experiences) and an intermediate biological phenotype, the HPA axis in a prospective study. Project 4: We will use PET to determine whether the postmortem receptor changes differentially associated with major depression and suicide can be distinguished in vivo. Effects of susceptibility gene expression on binding to 5-HTT, 5-HTiA and MAOA will be determined by PET and related to depression and suicidal behavior. Project 5 builds on our familial transmission results. This bottom-up familial transmission study will examine suicidality, aggression/impulsivity, serotonin susceptibility genes, and psychopathology in very high-risk families with depressed adolescent attempter probands. Projects 6 and 7 involve murine models of depression and aggression related to single genes and an inbred strain. Effects of altered gene expression at critical phases and of maternal deprivation on behavior, brain morphology, gene expression profiles, neurogenesis and biochemistry will be evaluated and compared with clinical findings. Project 8 proposed use of statistical model selection for suicide prediction and analysis of large postmortem and in vivo imaging data sets using statistical learning theory that allows the flexible fitting of models with many predictors.       n/a",The Neurobiology of Suicidal Behavior,7640534,P50MH062185,"['Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strain', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Maternal Deprivation', 'Mental disorders', 'Methaqualone', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Serotonin', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surgeon', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'brain morphology', 'depressed', 'depression', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurogenesis', 'proband', 'receptor', 'response', 'serotonin transporter', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,P50,2009,2127235,0.08607776180487235
"Clinical Validation of BCT - Phase II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fracture risk assessment is integral to the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, a devastating clinical condition of which over 40 million Americans are at risk. Due to limitations in areal BMD measures obtained from 2D DXA scans - the current clinical standard for diagnosis of osteoporosis - it has recently become clear that those at risk of osteoporotic fracture need to be better identified. A 3D biomechanics-based technique, which we term Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT), addresses this need through a combination of engineering finite element analysis, 3D quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and bone fracture biomechanics. The main outcome parameter of BCT is an estimate of the biomechanical risk of a bone fracture that accounts for such factors as the patient's 3D bone geometry and distribution of bone density, body-weight, height, trochanteric soft tissue thickness (for hip fractures), muscle moment arm (for spine), and the age-related risk of sustaining an overload event (such as a fall or lifting of a heavy object with back bent). In the larger context of translating BCT to clinical practice, we seek in this Phase II SBIR project to test the overall hypothesis that BCT is a better predictor of osteoporotic fracture than is areal BMD, for both hip and spine fracture and for both women and men. In Phase I of this project, we successfully applied this technique to explain observed age-related trends in hip fracture rates. For Phase II, we plan in our first Aim to refine our BCT technique to produce a fully automated, highly reliable and highly accurate software suite with the capability to analyze CT scans acquired for any medical test with coverage of the hip and/or spine without an external calibration phantom. For Aim 2, in order to ensure optimal prediction of clinical fractures, we will further refine our overall BCT process by calibrating results from the two cohorts (the Mayo Clinic cohort of 750 men and women in Rochester MN, and the MrOS cohort of 3,500 men in six U.S. locations). Issues to be resolved in this calibration process include determining optimal methods for measuring soft tissue thickness, muscle moment arms, and spine loading. This analysis will also enable us to calibrate our function for age- related risk of sustaining an overload event, which may depend on both fracture type (hip vs. spine) and sex. In Aim 3, we will compile normative data for BCT outcomes, critical information for interpretation of clinical results. Having refined and calibrated the overall BCT technique and identified the most successful BCT predictors of clinical fracture in the Mayo and MrOS cohorts, we will proceed in Aim 4 to test the validity of these predictors in a fully prospective manner, without any further modification of the BCT technique. For this, we will analyze the AGES cohort of 5,500 women and men in Reykjavik, Iceland, for incident hip and spine fracture. Taken together, this multi-cohort international validation study will provide new insight into osteoporotic fracture etiology, important advancements for the BCT method, and a thorough evaluation of BCT clinical performance. This project should therefore have a significant impact on osteoporosis research and clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Successful translation of BCT to clinical practice has the potential to greatly improve non-invasive assessment of fracture risk, which would represent an important advance in the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.           Statement of Relevance This project will provide clinical validation to Biomechanical Computed Tomography, a promising clinical alternative to DXA for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

"HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af. Am. Young Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent epidemiological evidence indicates that the risk of contracting HIV is increasing among African American young adults living in the rural South. African American communities in rural Georgia are characterized by chronic unemployment and poverty along with a dearth of health and educational resources. Young adults in these communities face significant barriers to adequate employment and higher education. Many respond to this lack of opportunity and the resulting economic pressure by engaging in high-risk behavior, including substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Although young adults attending higher education have been studied extensively, barriers to obtaining valid samples have prevented empirical research on the risk and protective factors that affect rural African American young adults who do not attend college. The research proposed in this R-21 application addresses the public health need to develop new approaches to obtaining valid samples of hard-to-reach members of populations at risk for HIV and substance use and to identify the protective factors that dissuade them from engaging in high risk behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) test the feasibility of Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for obtaining a sample of rural African American young adults age 18-21 who are out of school and living in resource- poor, rural environments, and (2) evaluate a model of the personal, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors that explain high-risk sexual behavior among these young people. RDS is a novel technique that combines ""snowball sampling"" with a mathematical model that weights the sample to compensate for its non-random nature. RDS will be used to obtain a sample of 240 rural African American young adults. Data will be gathered to evaluate a heuristic model that includes the following predictors: socioeconomic and personal stressors; the negative emotions these stressors induce; support and socialization from prosocial adults; intrapersonal protective processes, including a future orientation, self-regulation, emotion regulation, and racial identity; affiliations with risk-taking peers and sexual partners; and antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior, such as behavioral intentions and attitudes toward sexually protective behaviors.           n/a",HIV Risk Behavior in out-of school rural Af.

"Computerized population Programs for Three Cancer Risks   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The specific aims of this research project                            are (1) to replicate one of the most effective approaches to behavioral              intervention, a series of expert system interventions, for both smoking              cessation and reduction of dietary fat on a national sample; (2) to extend the       intervention to the reduction of sedentary life style; (3) to develop and            assess the effectiveness of an innovative automated counseling intervention,         the TLC telecommunications system, applied to the same 3 behavioral risk             factors; (4) to compare the effectiveness of the current modular expert system       approach with an integrated expert system intervention, and (5) to determine         the cost-effectiveness of each of the 3 interventions. All subjects will be at       risk for all 3 risk factors and all interventions would intervene on all 3 risk      factors simultaneously. The modular expert system intervention involves 3            assessments, each followed by 3 separate feedback reports at 6-month intervals       for each of the risk factors. The telecommunications system involves briefer         assessments on each risk factor and counseling luring regular telephone              contacts over a 12-month period. The integrated expert system intervention           involves a single assessment on 3 occasions of all 3 risk factors followed by        intervention on all 3 risk factors simultaneously in an attempt to increase          efficiency and capitalize on the covariance between the behaviors. All 3             interventions are based on the Transtheoretical Model. The national sample           would be 1600 subjects recruited throughout the continental United States using      random digit dial telephone methodology. All interventions are designed to           impact on a total population and a proactive recruitment procedure will be           employed to recruit more than 75 percent of the eligible sample.

"PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): This application was            initially submitted as an R29 FIRST Award, and is being re-submitted as an R01       in response to Program Announcement, PA-97-065 (NIA) entitled, ""Social               Cognition and Aging.""                                                                 The goal of this project is to determine how individual risk perceptions             influence health behaviors among the near-elderly (51-61) and decisions              regarding wealth holdings among the elderly (70+). Among the near-elderly, the       following health behaviors will be studied: the use of preventive services           (mammography, prostate screening, and cholesterol screening), weight loss and        exercise. The preventive services are designed to reduce mortality from cancer       and heart disease. Weight loss and exercise are both preventive measures as          well as mitigators of harm that results from health shocks. Expanding the use        of these preventive and mitigating measures are important to reduce morbidity        and mortality from heart disease and cancer. Among the elderly, the behavior of      interest relates to asset accumulation/dissaving, specifically focusing on           housing decisions. The specific decisions will be selling a house, and changes       in housing wealth holdings. The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6372233,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,181196,0.012243940544500648

The two decisions will be analyzed because housing       assets likely have fewer measurement errors, and because housing is the major        component of wealth for most elderly persons. Housing decisions are important        from a policy perspective because they may represent precautionary savings to        finance long-term care, a substantial risk the elderly face.                                                                                                              The proposed conceptual model is an extension of the common Bayesian learning        model whereby prior risk perceptions are updated on the basis of information.        Our model holds that updated risk perceptions, in turn, influence behavior.          Risk perceptions will be estimated as enodogenous explanatory variables              simultaneously with health behaviors among the near-elderly and housing              decisions among the elderly. The panel structure of the data bases to be used        (4 waves of Health and Retirement Study; 3 waves of Asset and Health Dynamics        Among the Oldest Old) will allow for the modeling of behaviors in time 3 or 4        as a function of changes in risk perceptions regarding longevity and of needing      nursing home care between waves 1 and 2 and 1 and 3.                                                                                                                      n/a",PERCEPTION OF RISK AND BEHAVIOR IN THE ELDERLY,6169107,R01AG015868,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' cholesterol', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' exercise', ' health behavior', ' health care service utilization', ' human middle age (35-64)', ' human subject', ' mammography', ' perception', ' prevention', ' prostate', ' socioeconomics', ' weight loss']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,178725,0.012243940544500648
"Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning Project Abstract Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals. Currently there are no proven effective therapies for treatment of advanced non-neovascular AMD, termed geographic atrophy (GA). Earlier intervention may be preferable, but this would require identification of those individuals with the highest risk for progression to atrophy. Over the last two decades, various studies including ours have identified several optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based factors that appear to associate with a higher risk for AMD progression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a deep learning - artificial intelligence (AI) construct can objectively and automatically learn and quantify the most important risk factors, yielding a better prediction of AMD progression risk than current subjectively specified features. In this proposal, we will first develop an AI- based system to automatically identify the “subjectively-specified” high risk factors based on individual spectral domain (SD) OCT 2D scans, and to automatically segment GA (the end-stage outcome variable of AMD) in OCT 2D en face maps. Subsequently, as a proof-of-concept study of our hypothesis, we will apply an AI-based “reverse learning” approach to objectively learn and identify AMD high risk factors in longitudinal OCT data. To achieve these objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate an AI approach to classify individual OCT 2D scans as containing or not containing the pre-specified risk factor(s). In our previous work, we manually identified the presence or absence of the pre-specific high-risk factors and assigned to a risk score based on the entire OCT volume. Such approach was time consuming and not precise. In this proposal, an AI algorithm will be applied to detect the high risk factors from individual OCT scans. Hence, the precision of the scoring system can be greatly enhanced with high computational complexity. Aim 2: Develop and validate an AI approach to segment GA lesions from 2D OCT en face maps. For the OCT volumes having atrophy, we will perform the GA segmentation from the choroidal hypertransmission-resulted en face map using the multi-scale CNNs. Aim 3: Develop and validate an AI “reverse learning” approach to objectively identify the high risk factors using longitudinal OCT data. The “reverse learning” will be based on the multiple CNNs, followed by de- convolutional networks to identify the high risk factors objectively. Our previous scoring system will possibly be refined and optimized by the potential inclusion (or substitution) of novel risk factors derived from our objective AI approaches. The work in this proposal will be performed retrospectively in SD-OCT images from the image data pool that the multi-PI Sadda has aggregated over years as the director of the Doheny image reading center. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness among elderly individuals and it may be preferable to intervene at an earlier stage in the disease process. We propose to use artificial intelligence techniques to automatically and objectively identify and quantify end-stage atrophy as well to identify the features on spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), which are associated with a higher risk for progression to late atrophic AMD. This research should have implications for clinical practice in the staging and monitoring of AMD patients, as well as facilitating new therapeutic trials for AMD.",Discovery and Validation of AMD Biomarkers for Progression Using Deep Learning,9986814,R21EY030619,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Blindness', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Early Intervention', 'Early intervention trials', 'Elderly', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'geographic atrophy', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'research study']",NEI,DOHENY EYE INSTITUTE,R21,2020,196250,0.06333542742608513
"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,9973232,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'acute care', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'severe injury', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2020,154553,0.09524717884449392
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9910447,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,721582,0.1608150437112739
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,0.05658815319385129
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Development of End-To-End Clinical Decision Support Tools To Prevent Cardiotoxic Drug Response SUMMARY Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data, we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development for other conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is the development of a clinical decision support tool that can be used to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation based on deep learning and genetics. This tool could be used to prevent potentially fatal side effects of medications when alternatives are available, or increase vigilance when safer alternatives are not available.

"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home.

"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,9951503,K23MH122669,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Disclosure', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Twitter', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'girls', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social norm', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'visual tracking', 'web interface']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2020,195616,0.02349356041417387
"Machine learning approaches towards risk assessment and prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY The primary objectives of this project include understanding the interplay between molecular, genetic and clinical factors related to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), method development for accurate risk assessment of APOs well before they occur, and method development for collecting additional clinical data in routine treatment of at-risk-subjects. Towards these goals we have assembled a team of investigators with clinical, translational, and computational expertise capable of identifying novel contributors to APOs as well as facilitating clinician-patient interactions using data-driven and theoretically sound machine learning approaches. Our strategies will rely on advanced machine learning as well as integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data and hold promise to bring precision medicine to the treatment and experience of women during and post pregnancy. We will predominantly rely on the data collected during the national “Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: monitoring mothers-to-be”; i.e., the nuMoM2b study. Using the cohort of 10,038 nulliparous women, we will efficiently accomplish 3 Aims: to integrate genetic, clinical, and molecular features towards a deep understanding of APOs; to develop machine learning models for advanced risk prediction; and to engage in active data collection towards risk assessment and model development.

"Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data Summary. Suicide in youths is a growing health concern, yet current clinical practice falls short of timely identifying youths at risk for suicide attempt (SA). The overarching aim of this research is to use data driven machine learning methods to facilitate primary prevention of youth SAs in primary care pediatric settings. Clinical guidelines recommend screening for depression, considered a proxy for suicide risk, from age 12 in pediatric setting. The proposed study aims at identification of variables (features) that can be collected by early adolescence, and contribute to prediction of SA in later adolescence. This study will leverage the effort that has been invested in previous projects: a study using electronic health records (EHR) to predict SAs and deaths in University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) hospitals; and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that included comprehensive phenotyping of ~9,500 youths. These previous efforts will be integrated to develop and optimize SA prediction in youth from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) network, from which we have data on ~40,000 who were screened for a history of SA between the years 2014-2018 (n~1500). First, in the CHOP dataset, we will generate predictive models based on UPMC data, test their predictive validity in CHOP youth population, and then develop, optimize, and cross validate these predictive models using CHOP EHR data as a training set (Aim 1). Second, in the PNC dataset, we will use multiple data types (demographic, behavioral, cognitive, imaging) to classify youths with suicide ideation (SI, n~750) and identify features (potentially modifiable) that are indicative of SI and may also point to potential mechanisms underlying youth SI (Aim 2). Lastly, in a subset of 936 youths (49 with SAs) with both CHOP EHR data and research PNC evaluation that was conducted at mean age 11 (T1), ~5 years before SA screening (T2), we will test the validity of models from Aims 1&2, and aim to identify data features that were collected at T1 and can improve/optimize/outperform the prediction of SAs that relies solely on EHR data (Aim 3). The proposed study relies on the expertise of a highly capable multidisciplinary team comprised of Dr. Barzilay (PI), child- adolescent psychiatrist experienced in suicide research and analysis of suicide related phenotypes in PNC data; Dr. Tsui (PI), an expert in machine learning who has developed predictive algorithms of SA and deaths using UPMC data; and collaborators critical for meeting study aims, Dr. Raquel Gur as the lead researcher who established the PNC, Dr. Ruben Gur who developed the PNC neurocognitive assessment tools, and Dr. Oquendo who will provide expertise in suicide prediction research. The team’s access and familiarity with CHOP EHR and PNC data resources, coupled with its interdisciplinary expertise, creates a unique opportunity to identify childhood features that can optimize later adolescent SA prediction. Expected findings can ultimately translate to real world clinical practice, be integrated in EHR, and help flag youths at risk for a SA in a pediatric setting, allowing timely identification and intervention, contributing to the mission of reducing suicide in youth. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death in youth, and a major focus of pediatric and psychiatric research, yet teen suicide rates are on the rise. The proposed research aims to develop novel computational tools that will allow prediction of youth suicide attempts using the individual’s electronic medical record, and help identify which variables (that are currently not part of the medical record) need to be integrated in the medical record of a child in order to optimize such prediction. The findings of this project are expected to translate to clinical practice and help primary care providers timely identify youth at suicide risk and thus contribute to reducing youth suicide rates.","Predicting suicide attempt in youth by integrating EHR, clinical, cognitive and imaging data",10038009,R21MH123916,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Gur', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Proxy', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'early adolescence', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pediatric patients', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'reducing suicide', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social cognition', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,498803,0.10685043233895423
"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10051655,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,790452,0.018764206499216132
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,9930662,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'feature extraction', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'multiple datasets', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,504970,0.16767193577291256
"Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach Project Summary/Abstract Because suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide and suicide attempt) significantly contributes to global disease and financial burden, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, the World Health Organization, and prominent researchers have called for the need to develop and improve prediction models for suicidal behavior. The period after contact with a health care professional is a particularly high-risk period, suggesting that prediction of suicidal behavior in the short-term after contact (i.e., defined as within one year in most studies) would address a critical need in the field to aid intervention efforts. However, previous short-term research has been limited by numerous factors, including a lack of research on youth samples, an overreliance on self-report measures or electronic health records, and the frequent examination of bivariate associations between only one predictor and suicidal behavior. The overall objective of the current proposal is to utilize several algorithms and assess their relative performance in the prediction of short-term suicidal behavior after contact with an outpatient specialist (defined as within 1, 6, and 12 months) using an unparalleled dataset. I will use data from a prospective, large-scale register of all outpatient mental health specialist visits among youth in Stockholm County, Sweden, consisting of approximately 160,000 visits by the onset of the current award. These individuals can be linked to population-based registers assessing a broad range of information (e.g., medical problems, academic information, neighborhood factors, parental psychopathology), which is a significant advantage over prior literature primarily studying demographic and psychiatric predictors in isolation. The central hypothesis is that the examination of numerous predictors within a large sample and the use of advanced statistical methods will significantly improve upon previous suicidal behavior prediction, which has remained slightly above chance. To achieve the overall objective, the current proposal is designed to apply machine learning algorithms through two specific aims: Aim 1: Apply variable selection algorithms that determine a limited number of salient predictors and, therefore, maximize interpretability; Aim 2: Apply ensemble algorithms that aggregate machine learning models and, therefore, maximize predictive power. The current proposal will significantly contribute to the field by examining short-term risk using machine learning techniques among a youth, outpatient sample, including varying follow-up windows and predictors across domains. Finally, the results from the current proposal will have positive impact by informing both 1) basic research through the identification of at-risk subgroups based on numerous predictors, and 2) the creation of a prediction tool that will aid in clinical practice. Project Narrative Over the past 50 years, prediction of suicidal behavior has remained slightly above chance levels, significantly hindering the development of effective intervention strategies. Because the majority of those who attempt or die by suicide are in contact with a health care professional within the year prior to their death, the current proposal serves to fill a critical gap in suicidal behavior prediction by exploring prediction methods for suicidal behavior among youth in the short-term (i.e., within 1, 6, and 12 months) after contact with an outpatient mental health specialist using an unparalleled dataset. Findings from the current proposal will have implications for clinical practice by identifying high-risk individuals for short-term suicidal behavior and aid clinical decision-making.",Predicting Short-Term Risk for Suicidal Behavior after Contact with Outpatient Specialists: A Machine Learning Approach,9981424,F31MH121039,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sweden', 'Techniques', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'World Health Organization', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational pipeline']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,F31,2020,45520,0.08551694905331635
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,9859704,R01MH121455,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Study', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'structured data', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'trait']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,561236,0.16014932782368937
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia ABSTRACT: Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research  Suicide is among the top leading causes of death in the US; individuals with schizophrenia (Sz) have a lifetime risk of more than tenfold that of the general population. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) are prevalent also in clinical risk states for schizophrenia, in teens and young adults at increased clinical high risk (CHR) for Sz and related psychotic disorders, based on attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS). In CHR cohorts, lifetime prevalence is ~77% for suicidal ideation and ~20% for suicidal behavior and attempts. Base rates for suicide by death after ascertainment is ~1% within a few years. Despite the clear public health problem of SIB in CHR teens and young adults, there is a clear gap in our understanding of their associated mechanisms and neural substrates, and their demographic, symptom and clinical correlates. It is important to gain a better understanding of SIB in CHR individuals in order to extend prevention efforts for CHR individuals beyond prevention of psychosis and poor functional outcome to include suicide prevention as well.  This proposal is an administrative supplement submitted in response to NOT-MH-19-026 Administrative Supplements for NIMH Grants to Expand Suicide Research, for the parent R01 of “Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia” (end 2021). It capitalizes on the parent R01's prospective cohort that includes data across multiple levels of analysis, including behavior (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuits (brain structure and function), as well as data on SIB collected for purposes of safety, using the PhenX toolkit measure of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Therefore, this supplement does not entail the addition of any new measures. It is expected there will be data on 90 CHR, 25 Sz, and 25 healthy individuals by mid-2020 amenable for analysis (preliminary data now includes 30 CHR).  This supplement adds a new specific aim relevant to suicide risk, namely to identify linguistic/cognitive biomarkers, symptom/demographic correlates and neural substrates of C-SSRS SIB in CHR individuals using advanced analytic methods, including natural language processing, machine learning, penalized regression, and sparse modeling. The work proposed is within the scope of the parent R01 as it entails the application of similar advanced analytic methods to the same dataset, to understand mechanisms of key clinical features in a young at-risk cohort (parent R01: psychosis risk: supplement: suicide risk). It is hypothesized that SIB will be associated in CHR individuals with greater use of words with negative emotional content and greater self-focus in language (use of personal pronouns), social cognitive deficits, depression, motivational deficits, gray matter reduction and abnormal resting connectivity. Suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) is prevalent in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, including during putative prodromal stages, in teens and young adults at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis; however, little is known about the mechanisms and neural substrates that underlie SIB in at-risk youths. This proposal for an administrative supplement capitalizes on a large prospective CHR cohort study that has data available across behavioral (language, social cognition, symptoms) and circuit-based (brain structure and function) levels, as well as safety data on SIB from a measure in the PhenX toolkit. It employs advanced analytic methods and automated language analysis to gain a better understanding of SIB in psychosis risk states, key for development of suicide prevention efforts in this risk group of young people.",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9941435,R01MH107558,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Face', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'lifetime risk', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,150193,0.1222302085280383
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors,9863809,R01MH121478,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Decision Making', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Employment', 'Equilibrium', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Link', 'Marital Status', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Probability', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'accomplished suicide', 'base', 'care providers', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical practice', 'collaborative care', 'common treatment', 'comparative treatment', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health administration', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'reducing suicide', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicide rate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,842134,0.1067571698984337
"Using claims data to study the association between Alzheimer's disease and suicidal behaviors PROJECT ABSTRACT Given that dementia represents the major cause of loss of autonomy in older adults, a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its related dementias (ADRD) could represent a critical moment that increases the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA). However, despite significant research progress in the past decade, it remains unclear if there are “clusters” of patients with ADRD who are at an increased risk for suicide, and how utilization of healthcare services, or the lack thereof, might be associated with SI/SA rates. This supplement will use large-scale commercial health insurance claims data and advanced machine learning algorithms to study these questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day.

"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington.

"Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores ABSTRACT Suicide is a leading cause of death that continues to increase, with over 47,000 preventable suicide deaths per year in the U.S. Although we have made great strides in using electronic health records (EHR) and other factors to predict suicidal ideation and behavior, our ability to reliably predict suicide death is close to zero. From a healthcare standpoint, predicting suicide deaths is tricky. We know that the incidence of suicide behaviors is far more common (~4%-5% per year) compared to suicide death (~0.01%-0.02% per year). Essentially, only a small fraction of those who engage in suicidal behaviors will go on to die by suicide. Knowledge of who these highest risk individuals are is critically important in directing prevention efforts and development of future targeted interventions. In addition, well over half of suicide deaths occur with no prior attempts, even accounting for lack of documentation of attempts in diagnostic codes. These “out of the blue” cases suggest one or more high-risk groups even more elusive to accurate prediction and prevention. Including genetic data of suicide deaths may offer substantial predictive improvement; genetic factors account for close to 50% of the risk of suicide death. Using the extensive genetic data, statewide longitudinal EHR resources, demographic, and familial data available to the Utah Suicide Genetic Risk Study (USGRS), we are uniquely poised to address this critical knowledge gap. Our primary focus will be to use machine learning methods develop models that predict suicide deaths. In addition, our large suicide death research resource will also allow us to model differences of suicide deaths with vs. without prior attempts. Of the ~9,000 Utah suicide deaths with demographics and environmental data, familial data, and 2 decades of longitudinal EHR data, the USGRS also currently has DNA from >6,000, which will increase to ~10,000 during the award period. Genome- wide molecular data is in hand for over 5,000 of these Utah suicides, allowing for tests of association of suicide subtypes identified using EHR data with “genetic phenotypes” represented by polygenic risk scores. The USGRS also has demographics, familial data, and longitudinal EHR data from 5 age/sex- matched Utah population controls for each suicide death, allowing for comparisons of non-lethal attempts to suicide deaths. In addition, we will collaborate with colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who are currently developing EHR and polygenic risk models to study substance use disorder, anxiety, and major depressive disorder in 37,510 participants in the Mount Sinai BioMe Biorepository. They will expand this work to include suicidality to provide an additional resource of suicide attempt for our model development and testing. We will additionally study polygenic risk scores associated with suicide death vs. attempt using our resources, Mount Sinai BioMe, and a collaboration with Vanderbilt University for access to their Biobank and to suicide attempts in the UK Biobank.. Independent validation will be possible through genotyping of new Utah suicides collected throughout the project, with additional comparisons to attempt cases in large datasets available through the PsychEMERGE consortium. NARRATIVE We will develop and validate models to predict suicide death, as distinct from suicide attempt, using electronic health records (EHR), demographics, environmental stresses, familial risks, and genetic differences. We will use 9,000 Utah suicides with longitudinal EHR data (>5,000 of these with molecular data growing to 10,000 by the end of the study), Utah population controls, collaborations with Mount Sinai Medical School and Vanderbilt University, and validation/replication with the large EHR and molecular data resources in the PsychEMERGE Consortium.",Prediction of suicide death using EHR and polygenic risk scores,10027263,R01MH123489,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Hand', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical Examiners', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Prevention', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'data resource', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'early life stress', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'model development', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,738338,0.15967167590276407
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,0.015911656030517987
"Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact The applicant, Mr. Geoffrey Kahn, proposes to identify key, modifiable predictors of attempted suicide among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS), and quantify the impact of hypothetical preventive interventions that could be implemented for these children. This research will be the foundation of the applicant’s doctoral dissertation, and will serve as one component of a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant for a career in independent research. Mr. Kahn will be mentored by a team of co-sponsors and consultants with expertise in suicide prevention, advanced statistical methods, child welfare research, and the CPS system. He will complete coursework in analysis of complex survey data and machine learning methods, participate in working groups on suicide prevention, machine learning, and causal inference at the sponsoring institution, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and present his findings to diverse audiences. The advanced training and focused mentoring that Mr. Kahn will receive through this Fellowship will position him to conduct future, independent research studies on the prevention of suicide, particularly suicide among youth.  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 15-24 years in the US. Suicide rates have been increasing for nearly two decades, with that increase accelerating in recent years. Children who have had contact with Child Protective Services are at increased risk for numerous mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. The opioid epidemic is thought to be contributing to an increase in the already substantial number of children entering the CPS system. Finally, suicide has been remarkably difficult to predict, with recent meta-analyses showing that most currently identified risk factors do not predict future suicide attempts or deaths significantly better than chance, and predictive accuracy has not improved over the last 50 years of research. Suicide is likely caused by interaction among numerous risk factors, but most studies have examined only single risk factors. New machine learning (ML) methods have been shown to out-perform traditional regression in predictive models, and there are classes of ML algorithms that can identify complex interactions among large numbers of variables. The applicant proposes a multi-part analysis of suicide risk factors among youth with CPS contact. The proposed project will: 1) assess the role of CPS case outcome on access to specialized mental health care and subsequent suicide attempt; 2) use machine learning methods to develop and validate a predictive model for suicide attempts; and 3) apply causal inference methods to quantify the impact of hypothetical interventions on the key risk/protective factors identified in the study.  The proposed project is consistent with NIMH’s strategic priorities, as it will elucidate complex groups of risk factors which contribute to suicidal behavior and identify the most promising targets for intervention. Project Narrative  The proposed project will identify key predictors of suicide attempts among children and youth who have had contact with Child Protective Services (CPS). Machine learning algorithms will be used to evaluate large numbers of variables and find clusters of factors, rather than single risk factors, that predict suicide attempts in a longitudinal cohort of youth. Finally, causal inference methods will be used to quantify the potential impact of intervening on key risk factors which have been identified AND have been determined to be feasible targets for preventive intervention after consulting with experts from the CPS system.",Predicting Suicide Attempts in Youth with Child Protective Services Contact,10003830,F31MH120973,"['18 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrator', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Demographic Factors', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fellowship', 'Foster Home Care', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Workers', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abuse neglect', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'child protective service', 'cohort', 'experience', 'foster care', 'health service use', 'high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'opioid epidemic', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'reducing suicide', 'research study', 'response', 'service intervention', 'stem', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.14395382810635785
"PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability in the US and are associated with increased mortality (e.g. through suicide and associations with chronic diseases and their risk factors). Evidence suggests that early detection and treatment of psychiatric illness is essential to improving long-term outcomes and may even modify illness trajectories at a biological level. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of patients undergo a long diagnostic odyssey before receiving an appropriate diagnosis and initiating effective treatment. Efforts to improve surveillance for emerging or occult psychopathology are often complex, costly, and have limited yield. Thus, there is an urgent public health need to improve clinical decision support for the early detection of psychiatric disorders in clinical settings. The growing availability of large-scale biobanks linking EHRs to biospecimens has created a powerful, but still relatively untapped, opportunity for psychiatric research. In 2007, the NHGRI organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network which has brought together investigators around the U.S. to facilitate EHR-based genomic research and the implementation of genomic medicine. To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely leveraged for psychiatric research. To address this gap, we have created a new, large-scale collaborative consortium—PsycheMERGE—which leverages the resources and existing infrastructure of the eMERGE network, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), and local EHR and biobank resources. In this proposal, we aim to: (1) phenotypically and genomically validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders (2) build clinically-useful risk surveillance models for mood disorders that also leverage cross-institutional genomewide data, and (3) examine whether EHR- and genomic-based risk profiles are associated with clinically-relevant health outcomes. We will further use these risk profiles to examine disparities in diagnostic delay by age, sex and race/ethnicity. The resulting diagnostic and risk prediction algorithms will be made available to the scientific community through the eMERGE network. Successful completion of these aims would represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR resources for precision medicine approaches to psychiatry, provide the first step toward clinical decision support tools that can be implemented within health systems, and create an invaluable resource for the scientific community. Neuropsychiatric disorders are leading causes of disability and even mortality. We have created a collaborative consortium of health systems--PsycheMERGE—to enable clinical and genetic research that will improve the understanding and early detection of psychiatric disorders. We will use cutting-edge computational and genetic methods to examine the predictors of psychiatric illness and provide a key step toward the goals of “precision psychiatry”.",PsycheMERGE: Leveraging electronic health records and genomics for mental health research,9873997,R01MH118233,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heritability', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data resource', 'delay sex', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'random forest', 'sex', 'support tools', 'support vector machine']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,791339,0.029195068293209444
"Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention Project Summary: The recent advances in information technologies and biotechnologies is an opportunity to substantially improve healthcare. To exploit the power of data to benefit patients, however, effective clinical decision support tools and novel, individualized interventions must be designed, tested, and implemented. Although there has been progress in the development of statistical/machine learning methods, numerous challenges remain to tailor and translate them into useful clinical decision support tools. Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) accounts for 15-20% of all adult deaths and is the industrial world’s leading cause of death. Clinical studies of SCA produce repeated measures on risk factors and multiple different kinds of events over time. We refer to these data as survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) data. In this project, we will develop novel statistical learning methods for SLAM data and apply them to two distinct aspects of the SCA problem. First, we propose to develop novel statistical learning algorithms that better predict an individual’s multivariate longitudinal data with a focus on the risk of first and subsequent SCA. Second, we propose to develop micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs to reduce behavioral risk factors for SCA among persons at high risk. The methods that we propose to develop will be applicable in many areas of medicine. However, they are motivated by and applied to SCA in this project. Our team has expertise in statistics including causal inference, longitudinal data and survival analyses, plus machine learning, epidemiology, cardiology, and behavioral interventions through mobile health (mHealth). This proposed collaboration has the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and test statistical learning tools for real-time risk prediction of survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (SLAM) outcome data. Aim 2: Estimate the risk of SCA and its dependence on dynamic modifiable and non-modifiable factors in population-based and clinical cohorts. Aim 3: Plan and conduct a feasibility-usability study of micro-randomization and just-in-time adaptive intervention trial designs for behavioral change to reduce SCA risk. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have contributed to the progress of healthcare delivery through the application of computational statistics to medicine. ! ! Project Narrative: Although sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the industrial world’s leading cause of death, SCA prediction and prevention strategies remain limited. In this project, we contribute towards addressing the global burden of SCAs through the development of novel statistical/machine learning methods for SCA risk prediction and the design of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for risk reduction. While developed in the context of SCA, these methods will be applicable in many areas of medicine and public health. !",Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA): Prediction and Prevention,9986884,F30HL142131,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cardiac health', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Information Technology', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'adaptive intervention', 'career', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'population based', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'time use', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,35760,0.029846700045833188
"The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of adolescent mortality in the US. Rates of adolescent suicide have increased in recent years, along with the advent and growth of social media use (SMU) in this population. SMU has been linked with sleep disruption, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation (SI), all of which are precursors of suicidal behavior. Existing research on the impact of SMU on sleep, mood, and suicidality is limited by cross- sectional designs and self-reported measures of SMU and sleep. To advance the field, prospective designs are needed that include objective measures and intensive monitoring of high-risk samples to rigorously examine the temporal relationships between SMU and suicide risk, defined as depressed mood and SI. This K01 proposal uses precisely such a design to test a conceptual model in which SMU predicts sleep disruption, which, in turn, contributes to depressed mood and SI among adolescents. The proposed study will harness smartphone technology to assess SMU using real-time passive data capture, actigraphy, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in high-risk adolescents. These methods, combined with in-person study visits, will examine the temporal and unique within-person associations between SMU and sleep disruption (Aim 1), SMU and suicide risk (Aim 2), and test whether sleep disruption mediates the relationship between SMU and suicide risk (Aim 3). Data-driven approaches of supervised machine learning will leverage the high-dimensional, intensively- monitored data to identify key SMU features predictive of suicide risk in adolescents (Exploratory Aim). The candidate will build on her strong foundation in adolescent depression and sleep research by acquiring new conceptual and methodological training in: 1) adolescent suicide risk, 2) technology and mental health, including social media use and mobile technology for real-time assessment; and 3) advanced computational skills. The candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve her training goals within the exceptional environment of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Mentors (Brent and Moreno) are experts in adolescent suicide and social media, respectively, and both have had success in mentoring early career scientists. The candidate’s consultants have extensive expertise in adolescent development and EMA (Silk), adolescent sleep and actigraphy (Franzen), smartphone sensing (Ferreira) applied to clinical health (Low), and advanced statistical and machine learning approaches (Wallace). The proposed training and research will inform future R01 studies that use these innovative methods to identify and modify clinically-actionable risk factors, including SMU and sleep disruption, to attenuate near-term risk for adolescent suicide. This program of research has the potential to yield high-impact results that inform the development of suicide prevention programs that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time. The proposed research along with this training plan will uniquely position the candidate to be an independent investigator and leading scholar in the important public health problem of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent suicide and suicidality have increased in recent years, which parallels the advent and rapid growth of social media use in adolescents’ daily lives. The proposed study will be the first in a broader program of research that leverages smartphone technology to examine how social media use impacts risk for the development and worsening of suicidal ideation and behavior among adolescents. This research program aims to identify modifiable risk factors, including social media use and sleep disruption, for adolescent suicide risk, and ultimately, contribute to the development of interventions that are personalized, scalable, and delivered in real time to prevent suicide.",The impact of social media use on precursors of adolescent suicide risk: A prospective study,10054721,K01MH121584,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Attenuated', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Environment', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Interview', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silk', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Environment', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'adolescent suicide', 'boys', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinically actionable', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital media', 'girls', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile computing', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid growth', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'sleep onset', 'social', 'social media', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,58402,0.11652582187866238
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,0.017314861177253775
"Finding Genomic Profiles of COVID-19 Phenotypes from the EHR Abstract: As the world searches for effective treatments and potential cures for the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to consolidate data, insights, and expertise from many disparate sources will be key to fully understanding the patient outcomes of the infection. Key to facilitating this type of research is a cohesive and secure research environment that enables clinicians, researchers, data scientists, and technologists from multiple organizations to work together with a common goal of better understanding COVID-19 symptoms, associated risk factors, and successful therapies. Building upon faculty, staff and infrastructure already in place through the eMERGE IV Clinical Center at Mass General Brigham, we are proposing the creation of a COVID- 19 Biobank Portal to provide a foundation for building a truly collaborative environment that is compliant with patient privacy and offers a common set of bioinformatic tools and a standardized IT approach for the staging of data and analyses. We will do this by accomplishing the following three Specific Aims which supplement the parent grant’s Aim I which is: “Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE participants based on genetic risk for common complex traits” which will focus in this supplement on risk factors for severity of COVID-19 illness in our biobank participants. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1: We will create a COVID-19 Centric Biobank Portal that allows general institutional use with proper research agreements in place where patient cohorts can be studied using easily assessable and transformed data and through which genomic samples can be obtained. Aim 2: Supplement the COVID-19 Biobank Portal with test results, phenotype risk factors, symptoms, and outcomes for COVID-19 which are derived from data in the electronic health record (EHR) by using natural language processing and computational phenotypes and by performing chart reviews to validate severity indices and clinical outcomes found in COVID-19 infected patients. Aim 3: Genetic data (array and sequence data) will be contributed to the eMERGE IV network and to the International l COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (https://covid19hg.org) such that data can be used to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for genome-wide association studies of risk phenotypes and patient outcomes and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for COVID-19 outcomes in our dataset and in collaborations with others.

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,0.04814289003631826
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million.

"4/4: Leveraging EHR-linked biobanks for deep phenotyping, polygenic risk score modeling, and outcomes analysis in psychiatric disorders PROJECT ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) are common, complex psychiatric traits that frequently co-occur and are associated with significant functional impairment, increased healthcare utilization and cost, and higher mortality risk. Not only are these three conditions highly prevalent in the general population and generate a huge societal burden, but recent studies by our team and others have shown that shared covariance from common genetic variation significantly contributes to these psychiatric comorbidities.

"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9901631,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,720691,0.10363874496533011
"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,0.0615290974380335

"4/5 CAPER: Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,0.033278477542179774

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD.

"Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention ABSTRACT After decades of improvement, premature mortality is uniquely on the rise in the U.S. among White non- Hispanic adults with low education. Suicide, drug poisoning (particularly from opiates), and alcoholic liver disease appear to be the culprits and have been coined “deaths of despair.” Suicidal thoughts and behaviors, illicit drug use, and alcohol problems (or “diseases of despair,” DoD)—the conditions that likely precede these deaths—are the focus of this application, as are the pathways to these DoD. Despite many years of research and in the face of rising suicides and a nationwide opiates public health emergency, we lack accurate and appreciable predictions of who will succumb to DoD and who will be shielded from them. Speedy new insights on the development of DoD are needed to inform efforts to reverse the rising tide of DoD. These can only be generated with decades' worth of prospective-longitudinal data with rich coverage of multiple levels of risk and protective factors—from community contexts to molecular mechanisms—with clinically-relevant characterizations of DoD. Realistically, no single extant dataset can fulfill these requirements. Secondary data analysis of multiple long- term longitudinal studies of recent cohorts, with recent young adult assessments, can provide an unprecedented opportunity here. We capitalize on three complementary, long-standing, prospective- longitudinal data sets spanning childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with recent assessments in young adulthood. (1) The nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) allows for fine-grained socio-structural characterizations of individuals and communities affected by DoD. (2) The community-representative psychiatric-diagnostic Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS) was collected in mostly impoverished rural communities in Appalachia—one of the epicenters of the DoD epidemic. It features a quasi-experiment that allows testing for whether cash transfers—received by a subgroup of participants for over 15 years—are protective against DoD. (3) Fast Track is a comprehensive 10- year randomized clinical intervention trial with 15 years of follow-up data that targeted mechanisms that are key in recent models of pathways to DoD. The first aim is to look longitudinally at the developmental epidemiology of DoD across the early lifespan in the nationally-representative Add Health and in the rural- Appalachian GSMS with a large American Indian subsample. The second aim is to test a childhood/adolescent strain  young adult social/economic disengagement  despair  DoD pathways model and also to test protective factors that could intervene on each pathway. We will also use discovery-focused machine learning algorithms to uncover new pathways to DoD in Add Health and GSMS. The third aim is to assess the impact of childhood interventions on DoD in GSMS and Fast Track. PROJECT NARRATIVE This interlocking series of aims allows us to identify who is at risk for DoD in contemporary America, how they came to be, and whether DoD could be prevented by early intervention. Results will provide direct, actionable and fine-tuned knowledge for prevention science and public policy efforts to curb the troubling new premature mortality trends.","Diseases of Despair in Young Adulthood: Risk, Resilience, and Prevention",9917845,R01MH117559,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Americas', 'Appalachian Region', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Coin', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Opioid', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poisoning', 'Premature Mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Appalachia', 'Rural Community', 'Science Policy', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'illicit drug use', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public health emergency', 'resilience', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'social', 'social structure', 'sociodemographics', 'suicidal behavior', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2020,371411,0.030807142242980153
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,0.027650580335972817
"Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence Youth violence victimization is common and increases risk for a host of negative health outcomes, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is the strongest predictor of poor quality of life following trauma, even among those injured during the event. Given the potential harmful sequelae of trauma exposure, it is crucial to identify acute post-victimization risk factors that predict chronic PTSD. At this juncture relatively little data exists to aid in prediction of youth at risk for poor long-term adjustment following victimization or other types of trauma, and there are no studies measuring relevant neural systems. Thus, our team aims to 1) characterize acute post-victimization neurobehavioral predictors of risk for chronic PTSD with a focus on prefrontal-subcortical function during processing of threat processing and frontoparietal networks for cognitive control, and 2) use machine learning to identify the most robust set of predictors of chronic PTSD drawn from a comprehensive assessment of youth neuroimaging, behavior and self-report, parent and family factors, and neighborhood and community variables. Our team is well-prepared to successfully achieve these aims, as we have relevant expertise in conducting prospective longitudinal assessment of acute neurobehavioral predictors of risk for PTSD in adults (Larson), conducting longitudinal assessment of youth victims of violence (Levas), and longitudinally characterizing neurobehavioral profiles of youth PTSD (Herringa). We will recruit youth victims of violence aged 10-16 from the Emergency Department at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and conduct comprehensive assessments at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months following victimization. To achieve a final sample of 200 youth at 12 month follow-up, we will recruit 240 youth, oversampled for risk for PTSD based on currently available brief self-report indicators. Each assessment will include measures of neural systems instantiating threat processing, including both reactivity to threat and anticipation of unpredictable and predictable threat, and cognitive control, along with measures of PTSD and other symptoms, cognitive functioning, family environment, social and school functioning, and socioenvironmental factors (e.g. neighborhood disadvantage, discrimination). We will examine how acute post- victimization variables (2 week) and early change following victimization (from 2 weeks to 3 months) predict PTSD and other outcomes twelve months later. We will use both hypothesis-driven analyses focusing on a priori specified regions and predictors, as well as comprehensive data-driven machine learning analyses. The comprehensive assessment will allow for determination of the additional utility of neural markers for predicting risk beyond previously identified self-report indicators. We expect this project to lead to identification of predictors of risk for PTSD following victimization that are linked to underlying processes (hyper-responsivity to threat, aberrant cognitive control) that can directly inform preventive interventions, ultimately improving the quality of life for youth victims of violence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identifying youth victims of violence most at risk for long-term post-traumatic distress is a pressing public health problem. This work seeks to identify dysregulation in neural circuitry supporting cognitive and affective processes two weeks after victimization predicts PTSD and other post-trauma symptom twelve months later. These data will advance our understanding of neurobiological factors associated with vulnerability to specific trauma-related pathology and provide an important step toward identifying appropriate early interventions in the wake of violence victimization.",Acute predictors of long-term post-trauma outcomes in youth victims of violence,9941466,R01MH124076,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early-life trauma', 'Elements', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'brain health', 'child and adolescent victimization', 'clinical care', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'physical assault', 'post-trauma', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic stress', 'violence exposure', 'violence victimization', 'youth violence']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2020,768281,0.0363415003655338
"EHR-based Genomic Risk Assessment and Management for Diverse Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recently, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide evidence for a substantial polygenic contribution to the risk of many common complex diseases. However, most of these studies were performed in Europeans, and new data and methods are necessary to tailor polygenic risk prediction to non-Europeans, to ensure that genomic stratification does not further exacerbate health disparities. The overarching goal of the eMERGE-IV network is to leverage genetic and electronic health record (EHR) data for diverse populations to design, validate and test the clinical utility of ancestry-tailored polygenic risk scores for common diseases. As a current member of the eMERGE network, Columbia University has significantly advanced its goals, having recruited over 2,500 diverse patients for sequencing and return of actionable findings, leading the effort to transition the network to the OMOP Common Data Model to improve the efficiency, accuracy, reproducibility and portability of electronic phenotypes, and contributing a widely-adopted XML parser for structuring genetic test reports. Since our last application, the Columbia Precision Medicine Initiative has also grown and now includes participation in several national initiatives, such as the All-of-Us program, in which we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly recruit patients under-represented in biomedical research. Our scientific expertise combined with our strong tradition of patient-centered research and community engagement in a socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse community of Northern Manhattan, positions us to successfully contribute as the Enhanced Diversity Clinical Site of the eEMERGE-IV network. We will leverage our prior experience with eMERGE, scientific expertise, and knowledge gained from participation in other national precision medicine initiatives to develop, optimize, validate and disseminate ancestry-tailored genomic risk assessment and clinical management tools. In Aim 1, we will continue to advance electronic phenotyping by contributing sharable natural language processing tools for converting clinical text into OMOP-based discrete data and facilitating phenotype interoperability. In Aim 2, we will develop and optimize accurate ancestry-tailored genome-wide polygenic predictors, integrate them with clinical risk predictions, and test their performance in diverse populations. In Aim 3, we will investigate ELSI issues related to the return of health risk predictions to diverse patients by ascertaining patients’, clinicians’, and IRB members’ views through focus groups. In Aim 4, we will develop portable EHR plug-ins to facilitate prospective risk communication and management using integrated genomic data, family history, and clinical data. In Aim 5, we will recruit 2,500 diverse patients and use a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of return of genomic prediction on the accuracy of risk perception, health surveillance, and risk reducing measures. This proposal will address major knowledge gaps in genetic risk assessment for diverse populations, and the solutions and knowledge gained will be broadly applicable to precision medicine for common complex traits across many clinical specialties.

"Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making PROJECT SUMMARY Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However, despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky choice has yet to be examined in humans. Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms (elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning during risky choice. To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e., non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Here, we take advantage of a new technology to directly measure serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine on a sub-second basis to investigate the neurocomputational role of these neurotransmitters in risky choice.",Direct sub-second measurement of neuromodulator signaling during risky decision-making,9961146,R01MH122948,"['Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Computer software', 'Decision Making', 'Dopamine', 'Dorsal', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morale', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neurosurgery', 'new technology', 'noradrenergic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,717227,0.034520661527447115
"Predicting complicated grief from grief processing PROJECT SUMMARY Most people grieving the loss of a loved one will experience a period of intense pain and focusing on the loss lasting around 6 months, which is known as acute grief. Complicated grief (CG) occurs when the experiences of acute grief extend well past 6-months post-loss. Thoughts and feelings about the loss (i.e. grief processing) occurring during acute grief may play a role in healthy grieving and protect against CG development. Identification of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms of grief processing that contribute to healthy grief resolution would advance knowledge of the goals of grieving and assist the development of interventions for complicated grief. Two core components of grief processing are top-down regulation and balanced loss confrontation. Top-down pursue related emotional representations and recruit proportion regulation is the ability to suppress processing of intrusive emotional information to a stated goal. Top-down regulation may facilitate healthy grieving by allowing reprieve from intense loss thinking. Balanced loss confrontation refers to the processing of the loss in a way that protects against overload. Confrontation with the l oss may assist in the process of reforming one's mental of the deceased. This tudy will test extrinsic and intrinsic measures of top-down regulation balanced loss confrontation during acute grieving as predictors of CG development a year later We will a sample at high-risk for CG, the suicide-bereaved, in order to maximize the likeliness that a significant of the sample develops CG. The s . findings produced by this study may advance the knowledge of how CG develops, assist in the identification of people at high-risk for developing CG and potentially form the basis for targeted interventions.  The following K23 presents a research and training program that will support the applicant on the path of becoming an independent investigator of the role of grief processing in the development of complicated grief. The research mentorship, coursework, hands-on experience, seminars and classes ingrained in this training and plan will propel the applicant to independence in the domains of1) Clinical Research, 2) Psychometric Assessment of Grief Processing, 3) Machine Learning analysis of fMRI, 4) Biostatistics, 5) Scientific Independence. team independent and The combination of the environment, t raining plan, research strategy and mentorship will not only provide the candidate with a spectrum of new methods and skills that will establish him as an research scientist, but will also produce a body of knowledge that will clarify the specific cognitive emotional grief processes that contribute to the development of CG. PROJECT NARRATIVE Complicated grief describes an inability to adjust to the loss of a loved one over the course of the first year following the death. This study will identify cognitive, emotional and neural processes occurring in the early grieving period (3 to 5-months post-loss) that predict or protect against the development of complicated grief a year later in suicide bereaved subjects, a sample at high-risk for developing complicated grief.

"Temperamental emotionality in preschoolers and depression risk PROJECT SUMMARY Depressive disorders (DD) are one of the most prevalent forms of mental disorders, and are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. The incidence of DD begins to increase in early-mid adolescence and peaks in emerging adulthood. The Stony Brook Temperament Study is a longitudinal study that seeks to identify early behavioral and neural precursors and risk factors for DD and understand the neurobiological and psychosocial processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically significant psychopathology. We initially assessed a large community sample of 3-year old children, and have followed them at 3-year intervals through age 15. This competing renewal application seeks to re-evaluate the sample at ages 18 and 21. Specifically, we propose to trace pathways from laboratory observations of temperamental low positive emotionality and high negative emotionality at age 3 to neural indices of emotional and social information processing and DD symptoms and onsets from middle childhood through emerging adulthood. In addition, we seek to understand how life stress over the lifespan and the developmental challenges of emerging adulthood contribute to risk for DD, and to examine the specificity of these risk pathways in comparison with anxiety and substance use disorders. Finally, we will use cutting-edge machine learning techniques to maximize prediction of DD and understand which domains and developmental periods contribute most to prediction. This information about risk pathways and processes should contribute to understanding when and how to intervene in order to prevent DD and limit their progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depressive disorders are highly prevalent and associated with significant impairment and mortality. Rates of depression begin to rise rapidly in early-mid adolescence and peak in early adulthood. This project seeks to identify early antecedents and risk factors for the onset of depressive disorders and to understand the processes through which these early manifestations develop into clinically signficant psychopathology.

"Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes Project Summary Motor vehicle crashes lead causes of adolescent mortality, making this a major health threat facing US adolescents. Given that 95.6% of novice driver crashes are due to driver error, improved skill should reduce crash incidence. Research supports this: novice driver crash rates peak immediately following licensure and decline steeply with experience gained over the months following licensure. However, it is not known which critical driving skill deficits present at licensure predict crashes. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interventions prior to licensure that can lead to the safest independent driving post licensure. With this R21 project, we will identify deficits in driving skills that are (a) associated with major predictors of early crash risk (age at licensure and sex) and that (b) can predict differences in crash rates within the first year of independent licensure. We will leverage our exclusive access to an innovative, newly available data source for young driver research. To enable study of safety critical driving skill deficits in novice drivers, results from a new (as of July 2017) virtual driving test (VDT) - developed by the PI, adopted by the State of Ohio and delivered immediately prior to the on-road licensing examination - will be linked to Ohio licensing and crash data. We propose these aims: Aim 1: identify skill clusters using multivariate clustering, regression and machine learning techniques to test the hypothesis that these clusters are related to age at licensure, sex, and time spent in the learner period; Aim 2a: use data on driving skills linked with reported crash data in Ohio to determine whether the skill clusters identified in Aim 1 are associated with crash risk; and Aim 2b: determine if those skill clusters from Aim1 are predictive of crashes in rural teen drivers. With a large sample of new driver applicants (>25,000), this study will examine, for the first time, differences in skill, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will create a normative dataset of novice driver skills; classify skill deficits by age, sex and time in learner period; and quantify the relationship between skill deficits and crash rates during the first 2 months of licensure (when crash rates are highest for young drivers) and the following 10 months as experience accumulates. If the use of the VDT proves successful in predicting crash risk, we will be able to identify novice drivers with elevated crash risk before granting a license. This R21 will enable the following lines of research: (1) Develop new interventions that address skill deficits through training, individualized to the needs of the novice driver (in partnership with Ohio). (2) Develop or adapt advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) or self-driving vehicle technology to mitigate identified skill deficits (as part of Dr. Winston’s National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center). (3) Conduct a prospective study (R01) of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk. Narrative We will identify safety-critical driving skill deficits immediately prior to licensure that predict crashes, starting at an age (adolescence) and a time (within the first year of licensure) when crash risk is high. We will leverage exclusive access to newly available data on >25,000 novice drivers: state licensing and crash data linked to results from a new (as of July 2017), well-validated virtual driving test that identifies driving skill deficits (adopted by Ohio). If this R21 finds the VDT successful in predicting crash risk, we plan to: (1) conduct a future study of the interacting trajectories of driving skill acquisition and cognitive development that lead to individual differences in skills at the time of licensure and the ensuing crash risk and (2) develop new interventions (training and vehicle technology) to address this risk.","Determining critical skill deficits that predict novice driver crashes: A prospective study using a novel virtual driving test at point of licensure, state licensing data and crash outcomes",10000116,R21HD099635,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Industry', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Licensure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Police', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Factors', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vehicle crash', 'Young driver', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'design', 'driving skills', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prospective', 'safety study', 'sex', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suburb', 'virtual']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,210334,0.02823604283739665
"Positive and Negative Valence Systems Underlying Suicide in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a major public health concern in adolescents and the second leading cause of death in this age group, highlighting the need to investigate suicide in adolescents. The two most prominent risk factors for completed suicide in youth are a past suicide attempt and a diagnosis of a depressive episode, each independently representing a 10- to 30-fold increased risk for completed suicide. However, while over 80% of suicidal youth present with depressive symptoms at the time of the attempt, only 30% of depressed youth will ever attempt suicide. These data suggest that depressed adolescents with prior suicide attempts represent a distinct neurobiological subgroup. However, at present, we have no biomarkers to identify those depressed youth who will engage in suicidal behavior. This proposal addresses this concern. Our proposed model is: (1) anhedonia is associated with heightened suicidal risk in depressed youth; (2) both positive valence (PVS) deficits (reward expectancy, attainment, positive prediction error) and negative valence (NVS) hyperactivity (negative prediction error, pain avoidance) contribute to anhedonia and underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth; (3) the habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a key role in PVS/NVS processes by inhibiting reward signaling in response to pain and loss; and (4) recent advances in high-resolution MRI address prior technical constraints in studying small structures such as the Hb. These advances now allow us to study the neuronal circuitry underlying PVS and NVS in a neuroanatomically rigorous framework. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia, not irritability, was associated with suicidality among depressed youth. Similarly, we found that both anhedonia and entrapment were independently associated with suicidality in acutely suicidal hospitalized individuals. We also developed the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks and identified brain function during reward anticipation, attainment, and positive and negative prediction errors. Notably, both RPET and a thermal pain task elicited measurable Hb activation. Additionally, utilizing an optimized segmentation and seeding approach, we mapped Hb intrinsic functional connectivity in adults and in adolescents with psychiatric symptoms. Building upon our work, we propose a tightly integrative study to test the overall hypothesis that both PVS deficiency and NVS hyperactivity underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth. We will study 30 suicidal and 30 non-suicidal depressed adolescents, ages 12-17, group matched for age, sex, and handedness. All will have comprehensive clinical evaluations (diagnoses, behavioral measures, computerized reward task). Neuroimaging studies will include structural MRI, resting-state and task fMRI (RFT, RPET, thermal pain). Machine learning algorithms will be used to examine which PVS/NVS processes predict suicidal behavior in depressed youth.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to suicide in adolescent depression, the cohort with the highest suicidal risk in youth. Using novel neuroimaging and modelling approaches, we will test the overall hypothesis that neural processes underlying both positive valence deficiency and negative valance hyperactivity play a key role in suicidal behavior in adolescent depression.

"Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings Project Summary/Abstract Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes. Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings. Project Narrative Worldwide, more than 600,000 newborns die from infections each year. India has one of the highest burdens of newborn deaths due to bacterial infections, which are commonly resistant to antibiotics. In this study, I will identify risk factors for newborn bloodstream infections, develop a method for predicting antibiotic-resistant infections, and create an infection prevention survey to reduce risk of infections in hospitalized babies in Indian Neonatal Intensive Care Units.",Preventing antimicrobial resistance and infections in hospitalized neonates in low resource settings,9871398,K23HD100594,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Assessment tool', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Carbapenems', 'Caring', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colistin', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hand', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hygiene', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infection prevention', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resort', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'biobank', 'carbapenem resistance', 'career', 'classification trees', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'critically ill newborn', 'health care model', 'healthcare-associated infections', 'high risk', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'low and middle-income countries', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'neonatal care', 'neonatal death', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'patient oriented research', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rectal', 'regression trees', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,170696,0.02484673471899455
"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,0.04825495608738381
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,9851004,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2020,831964,0.14623916410096108
"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,9844975,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,702056,0.1735237361061882
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9991720,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2020,755657,0.007085051402135738
"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9922214,R01AG063385,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Attention', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Blood Vessels', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discrimination', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Immigrant', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Experience', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Minority Groups', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Social Sciences', 'Socialization', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical encounter', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'dementia risk', 'deprivation', 'diabetes risk', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'residence', 'response', 'social', 'social factors', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'stressor', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'vascular risk factor', 'young adult']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,522652,0.04197517079457208
"Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction Suicide is a prevalent and burdensome public health problem that warrants immediate attention. As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide claims the lives of more than 44,000 Americans each year. There is an urgent need to identify objective and clinically informative markers of imminent risk for suicidal behavior. Agitation, defined in DSM-5 as excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension, is listed as a warning sign for suicide by leading organizations and in widely used risk assessment protocols. Yet, prior research on the association between agitation and suicide has key methodological limitations (including related to the operationalization of agitation), which has resulted in minimal empirical evidence to support agitation as a proximal risk factor for suicide. Addressing this gap in knowledge has the potential for significant impact, including informing both the clinical assessment of suicide risk and the development of just-in-time interventions for detecting and responding to acute suicide risk. This project will overcome the limitations of prior suicide risk factor research by assessing multiple behavioral (motor activity and vocal features [e.g., volume, speaking rate, pitch]) and subjective components of agitation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample at elevated risk for suicide over a short, high-risk period. We will test the hypotheses that (1) objectively measured real-time indicators of agitation correlate with both momentary subjective ratings and validated, gold standard measures of agitation, and (2) both subjective and objective indicators of agitation improve prediction of short-term increases in suicide ideation, plan, and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. We propose to collect high-resolution self-report (e.g., ecological momentary assessment) and passive (e.g., accelerometer) data on agitation using smartphones and wearable sensors from psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide ideation or attempt during inpatient treatment and the four weeks after discharge. Multi- level modeling and machine learning approaches will be implemented to examine (1) associations between objective and subjective real-time indicators of agitation and validated measures of agitation, and (2) the degree to which real-time indicators of agitation predict momentary fluctuations in suicidal ideation and suicide plan and attempt above and beyond other distal and proximal risk factors. The scientific aims of this study map onto the candidate’s training in three primary areas: (1) digital monitoring of high-risk patients, (2) advanced longitudinal multivariate data analysis, and (3) identification of behavioral and vocal biomarkers. The candidate’s training plan includes mentorship from Dr. Matthew Nock (primary mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co- mentor), Dr. Maurizio Fava (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard, Evan Kleiman, and Thomas Quatieri (consultants), as well as quantitative coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This mentored five-year award will propel the candidate to an independent patient- oriented research career focused on using scalable methods to advance suicide prediction and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE To make an impact on the rising rates of suicide, we must improve the ability to predict when and for whom suicidal behavior will occur. This project overcomes the methodological limitations of prior studies of risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors by studying a promising and clinically informative proximal risk factor for suicide (agitation) using mobile devices that provide high-resolution objective and subjective data, a high-risk sample (psychiatric inpatients), and a short period of high suicide risk (immediately following hospital discharge), and in combination with other distal and proximal risk factors. Findings will inform short-term suicide risk prediction and the development of novel just-in-time interventions for individuals at high risk of suicide.",Digital Monitoring of Agitation for Short-Term Suicide Risk Prediction,9981035,K23MH120436,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Agitation', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Consensus', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guide prevention', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'clinical biomarkers', 'demographics', 'diaries', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'standard measure', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,198877,0.186814377413956
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.03122545116502501
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10055559,K01MH121580,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurons', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'accomplished suicide', 'bead chip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker identification', 'biosignature', 'bisulfite', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'peripheral blood', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'prophylactic', 'pyrosequencing', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2020,174843,0.12267742674021209
"Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations Project Summary/Abstract Significant health disparities exist in chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) in ethnically diverse populations. African Americans (AAs) have ~25% higher prevalence of CKD, 3-fold higher rate of ESRD, and the highest risk of mortality among those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 45-95mL/min/1.73m2. The most significant traditional risk factors for CKD and ESRD are diabetes and hypertension accounting for >60% CKD and >70% of new ESRD cases, respectively. Non- traditional risk factors for CKD such as environmental, cultural-behavioral factors, geographic, education, insurance coverage, socioeconomic status and unequal access to optimal healthcare, disproportionately affect CKD health in ethnic minorities. The unique combination of these factors on CKD progression in the real world remains poorly defined. Identification of modifiable risk factors that may reduce CKD disparities would be invaluable to improve quality of life, life expectancy, and decrease economic burden. Simulation models have been successfully applied in other clinical domains, but are limited in CKD development and CKD progression, due to small datasets and the absence of modeling techniques using longitudinal observational health data. Further, no models have been tested in a real-world minority population to uncover the potential for interventional studies that would reduce CKD disparities on a larger scale. To our knowledge, we have created the largest, comprehensive database from electronic health records of >10 million individuals seen between 2006-2016 from a 2-year partnership between UCLA (1.8 million) and Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH; 9.2 million) systems. From the UCLA Registry population, we identified significant differences in eGFR trajectory decline between AAs and non-AAs according to baseline eGFR, indicating a pattern shift from a higher to a lower, steeper eGFR trajectory suggesting there may be critical windows for interventions to reduce CKD disparities in AAs. Race/ethnicity differences from linear mixed models of all ethnic cohorts persisted even after controlling for demographic and clinical variables known to influence eGFR trajectories. We hypothesize that the use of ethnically diverse populations in the joint UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry can identify a novel combination of CKD risk factors; and improve the performance of existing simulation models to predict CKD progression. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a machine learning-based simulation model for CKD and eGFR trajectories using the UCLA PSJH CKD/At-risk CKD Registry; and conduct internal validation of the models and comparisons with existing CKD risk models, 2) stratify and test simulation models based on different racial/ethnic groups, including external validation based on cross-institution comparisons, and 3) conduct focus groups with UCLA primary care physicians, who manage racial/ethnic patients, to elicit their perspectives on existing and designed simulation models to reduce CKD health disparities. These innovative approaches will facilitate our long-term goal to inform clinical decision support methods to reduce/eliminate CKD health disparities. Project Narrative Disparities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) disproportionately affect the development of CKD and CKD progression in ethnic minorities. The ability to use large datasets of patient information to reduce these disparities is greatly lacking. We will conduct simulation modeling to identify a unique set of risk factors that predict CKD and CKD progression, that can be targeted for individualized treatment in patients with highest risk of kidney function decline, with valuable input on the potential utility of this resource from focus groups consisting of primary care physicians.",Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease by Simulation Modeling to Improve the Health of Minority Populations,9848452,R01MD014712,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic group', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Planning', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Statistics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Registries', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'disease registry', 'disorder risk', 'disparity reduction', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority health', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,389501,0.027040514050862018
"MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide Project Summary  Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents. In addition to deaths, 16% of adolescents report seriously considering suicide each year, and 8% make one or more attempts. Despite these alarming statistics, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. Thus, developing effective methods to improve short-term prediction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical.  Currently, our most robust predictors of STBs are demographic or clinical indicators that have relatively weak predictive value. However, there is an emerging literature on short-term prediction of suicide risk that has identified a number of promising candidates, including rapid escalation of: (a) emotional distress, (b) social dysfunction (i.e., bullying, rejection), and (c) sleep disturbance. Yet, prior studies are limited in two critical ways. First, they rely almost entirely on self-report. Second, most studies have not focused on assessment of these risk factors using intensive longitudinal assessment techniques that are able to capture the dynamics of changes in risk states. These are fundamental limitations. While suicidal ideation may precede an attempt by years, socio-emotional changes preceding a suicide attempt often occurs within the time span of minutes to hours. This study will capitalize on recent developments in real-time monitoring methods that harness adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology. Specifically, we now have the capacity to use: (a) smartphone technology to conduct intensive longitudinal assessments monitoring putative risk factors with minimal participant burden and (b) modern computational techniques to develop predictive algorithms for STBs.  The project will include high-risk adolescents (n = 200) aged 13-18 years recruited from outpatient and inpatient clinics: (a) recent suicide attempters with current ideation (n = 70), (b) current suicide ideators with no attempt history (n = 70), and (c) a psychiatric control group with no STB history (n = 60). Effortless Assessment of Risk States (EARS) will be used to continuously measure variables relevant to key risk domains—emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—through passive monitoring of participants' smartphone use. First, we will test between-group differences in risk factors during an initial 2-week period, and determine the extent to which risk factors derived from mobile phones improves discrimination over self-reported indicators. Second, we will use statistical techniques to test whether the risk factors improve short-term prediction of STBs (e.g., suicide attempts, hospitalization) during the 6-month follow-up period above and beyond clinical assessments. Third, computational machine learning techniques—based on a priori and learned features—will develop predictive models that utilize the full range of intensive longitudinal data collected by the active and passive monitoring methods to predict group membership and STB outcomes. Ultimately, by leveraging smartphone technology, we aim to improve the short-term STB prediction and provide clinicians and patients with reliable, scalable and actionable tools that will reduce the needless loss of life. Project Narrative Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents, and despite this pressing public health crisis, little is known about factors that confer imminent risk for suicide. However, recent advancements in mobile technologies afford the capacity to monitor known risk factors—including emotional distress, social dysfunction, and sleep disturbance—which has the potential to revolutionize our insight and clinical management of short- term risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, the present study will leverage adolescents' naturalistic use of smartphone technology, along with advanced signal processing and computational modeling approaches, to identify promising short-term predictors of suicide among high-risk adolescents, which ultimately, may reduce needless loss of life.",MAPS: Mobile Assessment for the Prediction of Suicide,9982129,U01MH116923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Failure', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Geography', 'High School Student', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Loneliness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Music', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Value', 'Process Measure', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Sleeplessness', 'Social Interaction', 'Software Tools', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'actigraphy', 'active method', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'bullying', 'clinical care', 'diaries', 'emotional distress', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high-risk adolescents', 'ideation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'language processing', 'longitudinal design', 'mobile computing', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'psychiatric symptom', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sex', 'signal processing', 'social', 'social deficits', 'social media', 'social relationships', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,U01,2020,714133,0.16831862363198574
"Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities Project Summary/Abstract From 2000-2014, hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC, incidence rates increased nearly 4% per year, while most cancers in the United States were on the decline. HCC disproportionately impacts minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. To inform primary prevention strategies that will reduce disparities in HCC risk, we need to determine the relative contribution of well- established and emerging (e.g., hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, alcohol, smoking, cirrhosis, NAFLD, metabolic disorders, diabetes, HIV infection), and novel (e.g., medications, comorbidities, neighborhood attributes) risk factors to these disparities. To inform secondary and tertiary prevention strategies to reduce disparities in HCC burden, we need to understand the multilevel factors that contribute to HCC surveillance disparities. Answering these gaps in knowledge requires a robust high-quality study with a sample enriched for racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, we propose to leverage existing multi-disciplinary collaborations to develop an integrated dataset that includes electronic health records (EHR) data linked to population-based state cancer registry data and geospatial contextual data. This multilevel resource will include data on nearly 2.3 million individuals from three healthcare systems (mixed payer, integrated healthcare, federally qualified health centers) in California and Hawaii, thus providing diversity in healthcare settings and enrichment for racial/ethnic minorities: 59,400 are Black, 189,500 are Hispanic, and 441,700 are Asian American/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI). With this resource, we specifically aim to: (1) assess the relative importance of established and emerging examine the extent to which these factors independently and jointly contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk; (2) discover novel risk factors and assess their relative importance to HCC risk; and (3) assess racial/ethnic disparities in adherence with surveillance for HCC as well as examine the extent to which these disparities are attributable to modifiable individual-, clinician-, system-, and neighborhood factors (Aim 3). For Aim 1, using prospective data, we will assess the relative importance of risk factors and their contribution to racial/ethnic disparities in HCC risk with causal inference methods. For Aim 2, we will apply innovative machine learning methods to identify novel factors and validate their associations with HCC risk using modeling strategy from Aim 1. For Aim 3, we will use multilevel generalized linear regression to investigate the patient, clinician, institutional and geographic factors that contribute to disparities in HCC surveillance. Given the importance of sex and age/birth cohort for HCC risk, these social determinants will be considered together with race/ethnicity using an intersectional approach. By applying a multilevel framework to understand how biological, clinical, and social factors at multiple levels contribute to HCC disparities in incidence and surveillance, the proposed study will identify modifiable factors that can be translated to the clinical and community settings to collaboratively identify strategies to ameliorate racial/ethnic disparities in HCC. Project Narrative While most cancer incidence and mortality in the United States are declining, the burden of liver cancer is increasing; yet, we do not understand what causes 40% of these cancers. Furthermore, this cancer impacts racial/ethnic groups disproportionately, with minority racial/ethnic groups who are diagnosed at rates approximately twice that of non-Hispanic Whites. Therefore we propose to study the relative contribution of established and emerging risk factors, discover and validate novel risk factors, and to understand patient, clinician, healthcare system and geographic factors that influence surveillance; these findings can then be used to inform strategies in clinical and community settings to reduce the burden of liver cancer particularly for those at high risk.",Understanding the Multilevel Drivers of Liver Cancer Disparities,9997828,R01CA225478,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Alcohols', 'Asian Americans', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Federally Qualified Health Center', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'HIV Infections', 'Hawaii', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Maintenance Organizations', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Prevention', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'System', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'built environment', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer health disparity', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comorbidity', 'data registry', 'disparity reduction', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'sex', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social disparities', 'social factors', 'socioeconomics', 'tertiary prevention']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,645058,0.05095051159859265
"SCH: Prediction of Preterm Birth in Nulliparous Women Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Salleb-Aouissi, Ansaf Summary Prediction of Preterm Birth (PTB) has been an exceedingly challenging problem, predom- inantly due to the inherent complexity of its multifactorial etiology and the lack of approaches capable of integrating and interpreting large multidisciplinary data. It is a major long-lasting public health problem with heavy emotional and ﬁnancial consequences to families and society [ , ]. PTB is the leading cause of mortality and long-term disabilities among neonates. Most studies to date have examined 7 20 individual risk factors through univariate analyses of their coincidence with PTB.  Our previous work [NSF Eager 1454855, 1454814] developed predictive models for PTB based on non-genetic maternal attributes [ , 30 29 ]. A particularly challenging population to determine PTB risk is ﬁrst time mothers (nulliparous women) due to the lack of prior pregnancy history. An important question is to know whether factors other than history of PTB can be used to identify a nullipara patient at risk. Speciﬁc aims of the original project Our basic speciﬁc aims are as follows: (1) Longitudinal Preterm Birth Prediction: We will ﬁrst build a series of accurate prediction models for PTB using the nuMoM2b dataset. Such models will handle the challenges common to medical datasets including (a) imbalance in the classes, (b) missing data, and (c) disparity in data collection. We will achieve this by designing an objective function for Support Vector Machines that captures and corrects for these issues. Second, by leveraging the availability of patient future data, our Learning Under Privileged Infor- mation (LUPI)-based approach [ ] will signiﬁcantly increase the rate of convergence of the algorithms 22 and improve prediction with less data. Our transformative approach is well-suited for medical datasets that are both limited by the number of patients and inherently include the challenges mentioned above. (2) Combining clinical and genetic features for risk prediction: In this aim we tackle questions of causality between the genetic information and its various forms of phenotypic implications by leveraging the phenotypically rich nuMoM2b dataset. We will ﬁrst apply standard GWAS analysis to apply new insight regarding the changing patterns of genetic association as additional phenotypic data is accumu- lated as well as serve as a baseline. We will then seek to develop improved analysis of involvement of genetic contributions in PTB. (3) Clinical and social impact: We plan to assess the effectiveness of the methods in clinical practice by: (a) testing the effectiveness of the longitudinal models produced in objective 1 and 2 on existing clinical data at the New York Presbyterian Hospital. (b) building a sequential decision making model; this includes optimizing the scheduling of patient visits and diagnostic testing tailored for different classes of patients. Speciﬁc aims for this NIH Supplement We will extend the original aims to the following: (1) Interpret- ing PTB prediction models: we propose to explore the interpretability of our best performing models in an effort to understand “PTB mechanisms.” Our approach is to probe the most accurate models to assess which risk factor or feature are the most important and how they combine to lead to the PTB outcome. We will explore characteristic rules, along with inﬂuence functions to identify the instances that are driving prediction, (2) NetWAS Analysis for PTB: we will integrate NetWAS analysis into the study of PTB mechanisms and genetics. We will focus on the uterine expression levels available for automated NetWAS analysis from the uterus, and uterine cervix/endometrium, and integrate NETWAS- computed expression levels as features to the prediction models, and (3) Studying dynamic treatment regimes for PTB: We will investigate models that use reinforcement learning and causal reasoning to learn appropriate dynamic treatment policies in the context of confounding bias in the nuMoM2b data. This will in turn affect scheduling of tests and visits based on the individualized patient proﬁle. Broader Impact Over 26 billion dollars are spent annually on the delivery and care of the 12% of infants who are born preterm in the United States. A crucial challenge is to identify women who are at the highest risk for very early preterm birth and to develop interventions. Equally important, would be the ability to identify women at the lowest risk to avoid unnecessary and costly interventions. Our project has the potential to advance knowledge about this long-lasting public health problem. We will recruit female and minority students to this project. Research results will be disseminated through courses, conference and journal papers, and through undergraduate research and graduate students' theses.

"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge. Close to 48,000 people in the United States died by suicide in 2017 and rates have increased 33% since 1999.

"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9984613,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,572946,0.05188326446339286
"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,9916644,R01HL147358,"['911 call', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Oregon', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Sudden Death', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'sudden cardiac death', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,816401,0.0023549356425976464
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. The success of this project will improve the prediction of ASCVD and serve as a model for health information exchange derived risk estimation and population-guided preventative therapy recommendation.",Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data,10068605,F30LM013320,"['Address', 'Age', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Status', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical sciences', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'portability', 'recruit', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'tool']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.06791945249903635
"A comparison of firearm-related intimate partner homicide in Texas and Maryland: Prevalence, identification of those at risk, and the effect of firearm regulations Intimate partner homicide (IPH) accounts for one-fifth of U.S. homicides, with the majority of IPH and nearly all (91.6%) of intimate-partner related homicide-suicides (IPH-S) committed by firearms. While much is known about the frequency by which IPH is committed by firearms, research is far more limited regarding how victim/perpetrator firearm access, ownership, and behaviors affect IPH and IPH-S risk. We propose a case-control study in two states (Maryland and Texas) chosen to provide robust interstate firearm comparisons, as well as demographic, geographic and relevant law diversity. We will collect case file (medical examiner, police, prosecutor) and interview data to compare the histories of IPH victims (cases) to those of a random sample of individuals who experienced non-fatal physical IPV in the past two years (controls). The study will accomplish the following: (1) Obtain a count of firearm-related IPH and IPH-S across multiple subgroups through triangulation of data from multiple sources; (2) Describe the context of IPH and IPH-S, including precipitating events, relationship history, and perpetrator characteristics such as prior suicidality and prior substance abuse; (3) Assess the strength of firearm access, ownership, and/or use as risk factors for IPH and IPH-S, attending to intersections with risk factors at the family (e.g., abuse history), community (e.g., community violence), social and environmental levels (e.g., state firearm policies, accessibility of social services); (4) Identify differential patterns of risk between firearm-related and non-firearm related IPH, and between firearm-related IPH and IPH-S; (5) Examine patterns of gun ownership behaviors and attitudes in relation to IPH and IPH-S. We will create a database that will combine data across current data collection endeavors, creating a foundation for future funding. Findings will inform future evidence-based, multiple-level prevention interventions and allow policy makers and practitioners to develop and refine risk-informed approaches to reduce and prevent lethal IPV outcomes.

"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,0.04272698015247447
"Computerized Adaptive Suicidal Risk Stratification and Prediction ABSTRACT In the next 60 minutes, at least 57 people in the United States (US) will attempt to kill themselves, and five will die. Over 80% of these individuals encountered a healthcare provider in the 12 months before his or her death, but their risk will have gone undetected or, if detected, poorly quantified and not sufficiently monitored longitudinally. The proposed research will address this deficit by building and validating the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale -- Expanded (CAT-SS EXPANDED), software that can screen for, quantify, and monitor suicide risk in a way far superior to existing instruments. It will enable at least three key Zero Suicide performance elements, including systematic, standardized frontline suicide risk screening and measurement (Identify), tracking and communicating risk across locations of care (Transitions), and monitoring changes in patient outcomes resulting from continuous quality improvement activities (Improve). In a paradigm shifting innovation, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will not only comprise the first multi-dimensional CAT of its kind, it will import suicide risk indicators that have already been validated by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) directly from a health system’s electronic health record (EHR). This SBIR Fast Track has two phases. Phase 1 will build the CAT-SS EXPANDED, starting with well-established preliminary work and using iterative user testing with 20 clinician-patient dyads to refine the features. Phase 2 will have two Aims. The first Aim will validate the CAT-SS EXPANDED against an independent research clinician’s suicide risk stratification and suicidal behavior 24 weeks after the index visit (n=700). The second Aim will complete two-way integration of the validated CAT-SS EXPANDED into UMass’ EHR production environment and will evaluate clinical usability and acceptability with a new sample of ~30 suicide-risk enriched patients. Innovation and Impact: While traditional suicide screening tools exist, they are very limited, a conclusion supported by systematic reviews, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, and the NIMH. Because of these limitations, strong, well-validated clinical decision support to guide appropriate levels of care do not exist, reinforcing non-standardized and inefficient workflow, such as a tendency to conservatively order unnecessary emergency psychiatric evaluations. The CAT-SS EXPANDED will address these well-known measurement limitations using cutting edge strategies embodied in multi-dimensional CAT and EHR-derived risk indicators, an unprecedented capability impossible to achieve with existing measures. While this study focuses on the ED as a starting point because of its well-known risk burden and emerging literature supporting the value of universal suicide risk screening combined with brief interventions, the CAT-SS EXPANDED will be specifically designed and later tested as the first approach to suicide risk monitoring suitable for enterprise deployment across settings and locations of care, which is transformational for suicide prevention and fundamental to the Zero Suicide model’s emphasis on holistic system change. NARRATIVE  Having a psychometrically valid suicide risk instrument that efficiently screens for risk, provides risk stratification, and can be used across settings and easily integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) has tremendous potential to enable the enterprise implementation of the Zero Suicide model across an entire healthcare system, regardless of location of care. Because the software we will create and validate, the Computerized Adaptive Test for Suicide Scale – Expanded, blends computerized adaptive testing (CAT) and EHR suicide risk indicators previously validated using advanced analytic approaches by the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network, it is markedly different from existing instruments, which focus on a specific setting or patient population, rely on obsolete administration and psychometric methods, contain only screening capability with no monitoring components, and are not EHR-integrated in such a way as to tap into the data stored in the EHRs.

"Dementia Risk Prediction Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia. Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.  In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians. The aims of this project are important and timely, they will provide a risk stratification tool for targeted intervention/prevention for high risk individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem.

"Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE) ABSTRACT  Despite intensive prevention efforts from federal and state agencies, suicide is now the 10th leading cause of mortality overall in the US, increasing steadily over the past two decades and claiming more than 47,000 lives in 2017. The impact of suicide is particularly high among vulnerable populations such as adolescents and formerly incarcerated individuals. Suicide attempts also exact a high emotional, physical, and economic toll.  Although much research has focused on causes and predictors of death from suicide, progress in suicide prevention has been hampered by data linkage and methodological challenges. While national mortality rates are known, entities with the potential to implement large suicide prevention initiatives – health systems, insurers, and departments of corrections – lack the linked data to monitor suicide incidence in their populations, establish benchmarks, and establish an evaluation framework for prevention efforts. Many individuals who die from suicide have had recent contact with a health care, health insurance, or correctional system, representing critical missed opportunities to implement suicide prevention measures.  Two key needs are highlighted by the present RFA: linked surveillance systems that integrate healthcare, insurer (private and public), and correctional data with mortality outcomes to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating suicide prevention initiatives, and large and adequately powered datasets with rich health care access information over an extended period, matched with rigorous study designs for observational data. Therefore, our objective in the current proposal is to establish an in-depth suicide surveillance system linking multiple large, comprehensive databases and use that system to define suicide mortality benchmarks, identify predictors of suicide risk, generate risk prediction tools, evaluate suicide prevention efforts, and establish long-term workflow protocols to sustain the surveillance system. Our team is uniquely positioned to address these needs through our deep expertise in suicide, mental health, and health care utilization research; our extensive experience in application of rigorous epidemiological methods to large linked databases; our established access to comprehensive, regularly updated databases representing health care encounters, public and private insurance claims, corrections data, and suicide deaths in one of the most populous states in the US; and our successful work in prior projects to link all of these databases at the individual level using all appropriate safeguards and security measures.  This project will be the first to link these large state- and healthcare system-level databases to establish an ongoing suicide surveillance system to identify short and long term predictors of suicide and to inform and evaluate suicide prevention efforts in North Carolina and across the United States. We anticipate such suicide prevention efforts will get embedded in healthcare systems where at-risk individuals can be identified and referred for prevention and care, thereby preventing suicides and reducing their societal impacts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will define suicide mortality rates for four key target populations of patients either engaged in health care, privately or publicly insured, or recently released from prison; will define clinical predictors of suicide mortality risk; will evaluate the impact of a health care system-delivered routine suicidal risk assessment protocol on suicide mortality risk; and will lay the groundwork for the ongoing continuation of the suicide mortality surveillance system.",Innovations in Suicide Prevention Research (INSPIRE),10104283,R01MH124752,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Interruption', 'Link', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Prevention Research', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prisons', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Security Measures', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States', 'Update', 'Violence', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'health care availability', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevention evaluation', 'prospective', 'study population', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide mortality', 'tool', 'years of life lost', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,769521,0.14729164555232657
"Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt Project Summary Suicide is one of the greatest challenges facing Society today. Although research to date has provided important insight into the risk factors for suicide, it has struggled to make a translational impact on preventing suicide. New research strategies are therefore vital. The RDoC framework offers a promising approach to researching suicide, by moving the focus away from mental illness as the primary predictor of suicide, towards an emphasis on transdiagnostic dimensions, novel predictors, and integration of multiple units of analysis. Identifying the neurobiology underlying the transdiagnostic risk factors for suicide is an important step in understanding the mechanisms that lead to suicide. The majority of neuroimaging research to date has been purely correlational in nature, and often fails to generalize outside of the study sample. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, uses cross-validation to increase generalizability, and allows for the prediction of behavior, which is likely to have greater real-world utility. In this proposal, we will use the RDoC framework, multimodal imaging and predictive modelling to identify the molecular and network-level underpinnings of risk factors for suicide in a large, transdiagnostic dataset. Specifically, we aim to use Connectome-based Predictive Modelling (CPM) to generate and validate predictive models of suicide risk factors (depression severity, impulsivity, executive dysfunction and sleep disturbances), transdiagnostically, based on existing functional connectivity data (aim 1). Further, convergent research implicates glutamate dysfunction in suicidality, and emerging evidence suggests a specific role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in suicide and suicide-related behaviors. Subjects in the existing dataset also participated in PET imaging with and [18F]FPEB, a radioligand specific for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). We will investigate the association between mGluR5 and risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 2). Finally, we propose to integrate fMRI and PET data by using PET-weighted CPM to predict risk factors for suicide transdiagnostically (aim 3). Here, we will assess whether combining molecular and circuit-level units of analysis increases predictive performance and identifies novel predictive networks. In summary, we propose to use cutting-edge multimodal imaging, computational modelling and the RDoC framework in an innovative approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide across psychiatric disorders. Findings of the proposed study have the potential to inform risk models and identify novel molecular and network-level targets for preventative and treatment strategies that are critically needed to reduce the suicide rate. Project Narrative Suicide rates in the US are at their highest levels in over 3 decades. New research avenues need to be explored to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to suicide, and to identify novel targets for prevention and treatment strategies. In an innovative approach, we will combine the RDoC framework, MRI and PET imaging, and predictive modelling to provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms underlying risk factors for suicide in a transdiagnostic dataset including individuals with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and healthy controls.",Using multimodal imaging and the RDoC framework to predict risk factors for suicide attempt,9985179,R03MH118609,"['Arousal and Regulatory Systems', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention strategy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive control', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'falls', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabotropic glutamate receptor 5', 'molecular imaging', 'mood regulation', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'radioligand', 'radiotracer', 'reducing suicide', 'relating to nervous system', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide attempter', 'suicide rate', 'targeted agent', 'translational impact', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,83750,0.1684636416730567
"Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families PROJECT ABSTRACT  To advance the health and care of children, as in eMERGE II & III, CCHMC will assemble a birth cohort in eMERGE IV, ascertained on pregnant or recently delivered self-identified African-American (AA) women and their babies, along with the willing fathers and siblings. The eMERGE IV collection will be the inaugural effort in a new CCHMC initiative, a birth cohort of mother and baby dyads called My Genome and Me, Cincinnati (MGMC), conceived to develop an understanding of the genomics that informs health and disease risk, beginning at birth and continuing across the lifespan with dyads randomized at enrollment to genotyping with return of results as neonates or later as older children. Our eMERGE IV project will directly grapple with the ethical issues raised by return of results to families with different considerations operating in babies, siblings and parents regarding the particular phenotypes being studied. For eMERGE IV, as site-specific phenotypes, we nominate Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer. We will exploit the work done that will enable developing polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and genomic risk estimates (GREs) for these conditions in addition to the 15 others chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and anticipate developing consensus across the Network for the PRSs and GREs applied. The care of families will exploit the harmonization of the electronic health records between the adult and pediatric hospitals, which has been achieved with the Maternal and Infant Data Hub (MIDH) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. For data quality control we will evaluate discrepancies between eMERGE IV genotyping and low read depth coverage (LRDC) genotypes (LRDC sequencing will be at CCHMC expense.) We will collect preferences and attitudes of our local AA community with respect to genomic results and return of results. We will develop health risk-reducing recommendations and return GREs with and without actionable PRSs to assess the influence of PRSs on the adherence to risk-mitigating recommendations. We will use SMART on FHIR (Substitutable Medical Applications, Reusable Technologies and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) through the electronic health record (EHR)-integrated clinical decision support (CDS)-Hooks framework to provide CDS to both the adult and pediatric EHR systems. We will periodically revise PRSs and GREs and return changes when indicated. CCHMC will provide LRDC sequencing from >17,000 DNA AA samples from children in the CCHMC biobank and ≥50,000 subjects in total for genotype generation and mitochondrial DNA variant analysis. Federated geocoding will be available to all eMERGE IV sites from CCHMC. To disseminate genomic practice within CCHMC, across the Network, and in general, CCHMC will provide services to advance PRSs and GREs for specific conditions, starting with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, migraine headache, and suicide. In sum, CCHMC presents an aggressive program use genomic medicine to advance toward better health outcomes focused on underserved AA dyads of neonates and mothers with their families. Project Narrative Cincinnati Children's (CCHMC) proposes to join eMERGE IV by enrolling of local Cincinnati African-American newborn babies and their mothers with available fathers and brothers and sisters to develop predictions of their risk for Asthma, Atopic Dermatitis, Obesity, Hypercholesterolemia, Hypertension, Prematurity, and Breast Cancer (along with 15 disorders chosen by the eMERGE IV Network and disorders chosen by CCHMC Faculty) using genetic variation, environmental factors, and family history. We will test whether knowledge of having a higher genetic risk for these disorders will motivate closer adherence to health recommendations made to reduce disease risk.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Healthier African American Families,9988603,U01HG011172,"['7 year old', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent Psychiatry', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Ancillary Study', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Attitude', 'Birth', 'Brothers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Repository', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fathers', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Migraine', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Mothers', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Sister', 'Site', 'Suicide', 'Sum', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biobank', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data hub', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'minority subjects', 'neonate', 'polygenic risk score', 'preference', 'pregnant', 'premature', 'programs', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHGRI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,U01,2020,1338768,-0.0010732204986813787
"eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare Abstract: To enable the application of PRS development and implementation, our eMERGE IV proposal from Partners HealthCare leverages a large biobank (>105,000 consented with genotype data on 40,000), clinical data in the electronic health records (EHR) for >4 million patients from the largest integrated health care provider in New England, advanced bioinformatics expertise, prior leadership in PRS development and state- of-the-art genetic analysis, established expertise in returning genomics results, and experience using information technology to transform clinical processes and assessing outcomes. We propose to build on our expertise to accomplish the specific aims: Aim 1 (Discovery): Hypothesis: Polygenic risks scores will allow us to stratify eMERGE subjects based on genetic risk for common complex traits. Using the largest available genomic data resources, we will calculate and validate new PRS for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and major depression across diverse ancestries. We will 1) compare and benchmark the performance of existing PRS construction methods in different ancestral groups, 2) develop novel statistical methods for robust trans-ethnic PRS prediction, and integrate PRS with established clinical risk factors and family history. We will obtain PRS from our network colleagues for an additional 15-e- phenotypes (total 20) with a goal of identifying high-risk individuals, e.g., top 2% of PRS risk Aim 2 (RiskInsight Report/ELSI): We will develop a “Risk Insight Report” with clinical risk factors, family history, and PRS with evidence-based recommendations for high risk participants (top 2% of phenotype specific PRS distribution) for electronic clinical implementation. We will assess risk communication formats in our ELSI Sub-Aim 1: To test the impact and interpretability of two mock RiskInsight Reports summarizing PRS as either (a) dichotomous (defining the patient as high-risk vs intermediate/low risk) or (b) quantitative (providing a numerical estimate of the percentile of risk for the patient), with linked clinical recommendations in both cases. We will then assess, through surveys of diverse HCPs and patients, the extent to which the mock reports are understood by both HCPs and patients. Aim 3 (Outcomes): Hypothesis: Physicians will alter their surveillance and treatment of patients based on eCDS of RiskInsight Reports. Among HCPs for high-risk subjects, we will see at least one change in clinical care after disclosure discussions with subjects. We will recruit 2500 participants for implementation of clinical PRS in RiskInsight Reports using a SMART on FHIR app for eCDS integrated with the EHR. The primary outcome will be whether any HCP took any action within 12 months after receipt of e-CDS defined by ordering screening tests, prescribing a preventive medication, or providing lifestyle advice. We will conduct analyses of the effect of disclosing results to high risk participants to determine how personalized results changed patient outcomes in laboratory values, risk reduction behaviors, or health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The discovery and clinical use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for complex traits promises to dramatically change the practice of medicine. Our eMERGE IV grant will leverage a large Biobank and a rich electronic medical record to define the clinical impact of PRS derived from diverse populations and the clinical impact of returning these results along with family history and clinical risk information to participants and their healthcare providers.",eMERGE Phase IV Clinical Center at Partners HealthCare,9988785,U01HG008685,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Family', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physicians', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction Behavior', 'Risk stratification', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'clinical risk', 'data resource', 'design', 'economic outcome', 'evidence based guidelines', 'exome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'screening', 'support tools', 'trait']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,1216161,0.042079480243996235
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9985197,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic stress']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2020,193644,0.01613950671845164
