"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets. This new data approach has considerable impact for future generation methods in computational biophysics and drug design.",Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts,9756427,R01GM126189,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'Free Energy', 'Freedom', 'Future Generations', 'Geometry', 'Handwriting', 'Image Analysis', 'Induced Mutation', 'Ions', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Physics', 'Plant Roots', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Site', 'Speech', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thermodynamics', 'Work', 'algebraic topology', 'base', 'cofactor', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metallicity', 'models and simulation', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'mutant', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'search engine', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,319267,-0.0011858008124388045
"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",9715158,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,581271,0.03684361831152821
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9684634,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2019,297553,-0.005681597226329559
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9670817,R01GM101689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,310202,0.08753682188444493
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,0.00588642468002895
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,9798401,R35GM133548,"['Anions', 'Back', 'Biosensor', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Electrons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Hydrogels', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Research Proposals', 'System', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cheminformatics', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'quantum computing', 'receptor', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2019,377200,0.013538020337780086
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,9817829,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2019,326559,0.034409093875653426
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,9769745,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2019,998631,0.03135035829651453
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,9818963,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'learning strategy', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,341716,-0.010932393633864744
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9761970,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2019,1212566,0.00880488020285981
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,0.10966818121457253
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,9694695,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Screening', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual', 'virtual technology']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,235391,0.022127017973564447
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,0.023748692697035213
"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomechanics', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chimera organism', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Fluorescence', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organ', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talin', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction\xa0Force Microscopy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cellular engineering', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'mechanical force', 'migration', 'novel', 'particle', 'polymerization', 'recruit', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,0.0077794909847564275
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9732293,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,31648,0.003892020641394502
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9746739,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,327738,0.09920752653016164
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences. Unfortunately, this discovery process depends on human expertise for examining molecular structure, and given that hundreds of isoforms may exist, a human would be overwhelmed to objectively examine many similar isoforms. To fill this gap, this project will (A1) de- velop software that identifies structural mechanisms that cause differential binding preferences, categorizes similar structural mechanisms, and explains the mechanisms in English. The second aim of this project (A2) is to validate the software at a large scale on families of proteins that exhibit a variety of well-examined binding preferences, and through blind predictions with experimental collaborators. Our approach involves creating software that mimics the visual reasoning techniques employed by structural biologists when examining molecular structures. Not only are these techniques responsible for most major dis- coveries in structural biology, but they are also straightforward to understand by non-computational research- ers. This property will enable our software to immediately integrate into existing workflows at labs that do not focus on computational methods. This property also contrasts from existing methods, which generally output structural models, potential energies, p-values and structural scores which are difficult for non-experts to un- derstand or incorporate into their research. Often, an expert in biophysics is required to interpret the outputs so that they can be operationalized in laboratory environments. In preliminary results, our methods have already identified molecular mechanisms that govern specificity in several families of proteins. Verification against peer-reviewed experimentation has proven the preliminary results correct in almost all cases. Our methods have also been applied to make a blind prediction of binding mechanisms in the ricin toxin, which binds to and damages the human ribosome. With experimental collabo- rators, we showed that our methods correctly identified and predicted the roles of several amino acids with a hitherto unknown role in recognizing the ribosome. Using our methodological approach and our rigorous valida- tion strategy, this project will produce a highly validated, usable software package that will bridge a critical gap in the development of precision therapies and diagnostics. Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to precision medicine and precise diagnostics. We will develop software that will identify and categorize molecular mechanisms that cause these variations. The resulting insights will enable clinicians to more precisely select therapies to achieve superior outcomes.",Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins,9740715,R01GM123131,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'HIV Protease', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Nicotinic Receptors', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Population', 'Potential Energy', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Ricin', 'Role', 'Serine Protease', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxin', 'Tweens', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'base', 'blind', 'human-in-the-loop', 'hydropathy', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'preference', 'protein structure', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'simulation', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,LEHIGH UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,244161,0.0401461557492977

Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells. In doing so, we will discover new opportunities for drug discovery, with a particular focus on transcriptional pathways integral to metabolic disease and cancer.",Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level,9840248,R01GM065330,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Ataxia', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Deuterium', 'Disease', 'EP300 gene', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Homeostasis', 'Hydrogen', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'MED25 gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Negative Staining', 'Nuclear Receptors', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcription Process', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Activation Domain', 'Up-Regulation', 'biophysical techniques', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular recognition', 'peptidomimetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,440078,-0.01310309232515068
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,0.03773750064944121
"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions. Project Narrative The project concerns the integration of topological data analysis and machine learning architectures for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation induced protein stability changes from massive data sets.

"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9486119,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2018,297553,-0.005681597226329559
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9454479,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'lead optimization', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,310202,0.08753682188444493
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9486312,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,1527746,0.00880488020285981
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9543037,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,310328,0.0324819562682951
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,0.10966818121457253
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases. When transcription factors function they produce eRNAs.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,0.09195841266913377
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,0.023748692697035213
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9550852,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,266250,0.028149261893140997
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9567985,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,142621,0.09920752653016164
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,0.03773750064944121
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9607906,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Hospitalization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,31156,0.003892020641394502
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted. Prediction of bioactive molecular poses and activities to guide lead optimiza- tion and to quantify off-target liability effects are applications of the effort, and data and software will be made widely available to academic and industrial research groups.",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,9309936,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Industry', 'Electrostatics', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Collaboration', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'segregation', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment fees', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,310202,0.08753682188444493
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,0.10966818121457253
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,0.09195841266913377
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding.

"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9285277,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,327738,0.09920752653016164
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,0.10966818121457253
"Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA Numerous studies have focused on cataloging the genome `parts list', including transcripts, transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and chromatin states. Transcriptional regulatory networks have been inferred based on these data, leading to models of what TFs are master regulators at or near the top of the regulatory hierarchy versus lineage- or condition-specific TFs, which are downstream of those regulators. However, none of these approaches directly identifies which factors engage inaccessible chromatin to initiate the transcriptional regulatory cascades. Pioneer factors serve as keys to chromatin accessibility for binding by the majority of TFs in a cell, by binding stably to nucleosomal DNA (`pioneer binding') and thus increase the DNA enzymatic accessibility of the chromatin (`pioneer activity'), allowing the sequential recruitment of other TFs on inactive chromatin. By priming cis regulatory elements for subsequent transcriptional regulatory activity, pioneer factors serve as `gatekeepers' to cellular differentiation. Despite their importance, little is known about pioneer factors, and only a handful have been characterized. A major hurdle in characterization of pioneer factors is the lack of a robust, high- throughput functional assay. In this project, we will develop a new technology, termed Pioneer Interactions On Nucleosomal Engineered ARrays (PIONEAR), for high-throughput characterization of pioneer binding. We will use PIONEAR assays to survey the pioneer interactions of dozens of human TFs. TFs identified by PIONEAR assays to exhibit pioneer binding will be evaluated in vivo to examine chromatin decompaction on a broader scale. Identification of TFs that exhibit pioneer activity may lead to breakthroughs in directed cellular differentiation and reprogramming and the development of improved therapies to target cancer stem cells. Control of cell states, such as in maintenance of pluripotency by stem cells or differentiation into defined cell lineages, holds promise for regenerative medicine and cancer therapeutics. These cell fate programs are initiated by `pioneer factors' that recognize their genomic target sites and induce hierarchies of gene regulatory programs. We will identify human pioneer factors and characterize their regulatory interactions.",Surveying transcription factor pioneer interactions with nucleosomal DNA,9206289,R21HG009268,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Property', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer stem cell', 'cell type', 'ds-DNA', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'programs', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,221875,0.028149261893140997
"Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in drug discovery rely on the development of novel effective computational methodologies. This proposal advances an efficient and robust computational workflow for structure-based virtual screening of very large chemical libraries. The ultimate goal of this project is to arrive at a small number of candidate molecules with high predicted binding affinity to their biological targets, which will be tested in confirmatory experiments.        ",Integrating cheminformatics and molecular simulations for virtual drug screening,8858750,R01GM114015,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Enzymes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marriage', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Orphan', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Planning Techniques', 'Preclinical Drug Evaluation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Side', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized tools', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'research study', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'sperm cell', 'therapeutic target', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,293344,0.022127017973564447
"Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite major advances in the subject of marijuana and cannabinoid (CB) research, there are only a few CB ligands currently available as FDA-approved drugs, partly because of the absence of experimental structures of CB receptors and a lack of knowledge of the conformational dynamics of the receptors, as well as a limited knowledge of the ligand-binding (orthosteric or allosteric) sites within the CB receptors. Very few allosteric modulators have been identified for CB receptors. There is great potential for discovery of novel CB ligands targeting either orthosteric or allosteric CB1 or CB2 receptor sites. Activators or inhibitors of these receptors are being investigated as therapeutic agents for many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. In this project, computational modeling of human CB1 and CB2 ligands, receptors, and receptor-ligand interactions will be carried out. We are interested in discovering orthosteric agonists selective for CB2 over CB1, peripherally- restricted antagonists, as well as allosteric CB modulators, all of which may be able to provide efficacy without causing negative psychotropic effects. Systematic, computationally-intensive research will yield novel active hit CB receptor modulators, which can later be developed into lead drug candidates. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To model, train and validate various ligand-based mathematical models to predict and classify CB ligands as agonists or antagonists. Literature- reported CB ligands and activity data as well as experimental data obtained for proprietary molecules being tested at the University of Mississippi, School of Pharmacy will be curated. Ligand-based models will be constructed, trained and validated. Aim 2. To construct, validate and simulate computational models of the CB1 and CB2 receptors in their active and inactive states. Receptor models will be developed, some that are tailored for agonists (active state) and some for antagonists or inverse agonists (basal or inactive states), utilizing structural information from multiple homologous GPCR templates. Aim 3. To apply integrated ligand-based and receptor-based virtual screening (VS) protocols to discover orthosteric and allosteric CB modulators. Validated models from Aims 1 and 2 will be used strategically in VS protocols to discover novel orthosteric and allosteric CB ligand chemotypes. We will screen repositories of small molecules including MarinLit, ZINC, and that of the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR) and virtual libraries generated using computational tools to access extended chemical space. Top- ranked VS hits will be procured, purified if necessary, and characterized to confirm their structures. Aim 4. To conduct in vitro testing in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays. Potential hit compounds from Aim 3 will be tested in CB1 and CB2 receptor binding and functional assays in the University of Mississippi School of Pharmacy NIH COBRE-supported In Vitro Research Core.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through computational modeling of the requirements for modulating the cannabinoid (CB) receptor subtypes, CB1 and CB2, which are class-A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), we intend to discover molecules which act through the CB receptors and that could later be developed into new drugs to treat many important human ailments including neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, ischemic/reperfusion injury, anxiety, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.            ",Computer-aided Design and In vitro Testing of Novel Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators,9099196,R15GM119061,"['Academia', 'Adverse effects', 'Affinity', 'Agonist', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CNR1 gene', 'CNR2 gene', 'Cannabidiol', 'Cannabinoids', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis sativa plant', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Data', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Government', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mutagenesis', 'Natural Products', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Organism', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plants', 'Publishing', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Virtual Library', 'base', 'cannabinoid receptor', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'nanomolar', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'painful neuropathy', 'pharmacophore', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'repository', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI,R15,2016,427379,0.03740176972866177
"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level. The two aims are: (1) Identify shelterin interactomes and post-translational modifications on shelterin components using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (CXMS); (2) Reveal the functional roles of Tpz1 in coordinating shelterin components for telomerase-mediated and recombination-based telomere elongation via analyzing telomere sequences using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) next- generation sequencing technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Telomeres are closely involved in stem cell differentiation and cancer cell proliferation. The results of this study will lead to new mechanistc models for telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection. Therefore, valuable targets for mechanism- driven design of cancer and aging therapeutics may be identified through this research.            ",Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis,8738357,R01GM098943,"['Aging', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Models', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosomes', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'Elongation by Telomerase', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Fission Yeast', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Histone Code', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleoproteins', 'Parents', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SS DNA BP', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'crosslink', 'design', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'member', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'prevent', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'single molecule', 'stem cell differentiation', 'telomere']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,67594,0.009985202616481994
"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture.

At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is entitled ""Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning."" One of the most challenging and longest studied problems in computer-aided drug design has been affinity prediction of small molecule ligands for their cognate protein targets. Despite decades of work, quantitative structure-activity re- lationship prediction (QSAR) approaches still suffer from poor accuracy, especially when predicting outside of closely related series of molecules. Even with high-quality structures of target proteins, approaches grounded in physics are also far from robust and accurate enough for reliable use in drug lead optimization. This proposal will build upon a foundation in multiple-instance machine learning applied to computer-aided drug design problems and develop a robust, accurate, and practically applicable affinity prediction methodology. The methodology requires only ligand structures and associated activity data for training, and it induces a virtual protein binding site composed of molecular fragments. The virtual binding pocket (or ""pocketmol"") is used in conjunction with a scoring function developed originally for molecular docking. The pocketmol configuration is chosen such that the optimal conformation and alignment of a ligand (based on the docking scoring function), yields scores for training ligands that are close to the known experimental values. Feasibility has been demon- strated in papers involving both membrane-bound receptors and enzymes.  However, multiple challenges remain and are the subject of the proposed research. There are three key issues. First, there exist many pocketmols that satisfy the requirements of fitting the training data, so general solutions must be developed to address the inductive bias of the learning procedure as well as model selection after the procedure. Second, since any particular model is the product of a learning process, it will have some domain of applicability, with some new molecules likely to be predicted well and others poorly. Further, the model will be better informed by learning with certain new molecules but not others. We must develop solutions for estimating confidence of predictions for new molecules as well as for identifying particular molecules that will be highly informative. Third, the operational application of these methods involves model building, guided chemical synthesis, and iterative refinement of models. Convincing validation will require application on temporal series of molecules synthesized for multiple targets of pharmaceutical interest. The proposed work will develop novel methods to address these challenges and will establish extensive validation on multiple pharmaceutically relevant temporal series of small molecules that were the subject of real-world lead-optimization exercises.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The dominant mode of therapeutic discovery involves the design ""me-too"" drugs that are very similar in structure and effect to existing drugs. In order to address the unmet medical needs of an aging population, novel therapeutics must be developed, and this will require much more creativity in the design process. The proposed research will develop a predictive computational framework to aid in active design of structurally novel drug molecules during the drug discovery lead optimization process.            ",Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning,8436505,R01GM101689,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Exercise', 'Foundations', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Series', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'blind', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer framework', 'design', 'design and construction', 'drug discovery', 'falls', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'process optimization', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'receptor binding', 'small molecule', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2013,291402,0.06320555000554819
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor).

We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling.

We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins.

"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.        Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells. Our proposal is aimed at understanding the common strategies the bacteria use to recognize and deliver the secreted proteins to these specialized secretion systems. The results from our studies are likely to be valuable in the development of novel antimicrobials to treat common infections caused by these organisms.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,0.004416486995230966

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.       n/a",Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure,8325094,R01MH095087,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Neurobiology', 'Characteristics', 'Complementary DNA', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Defect', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Filopodia', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intracellular Membranes', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neck', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurites', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Radial', 'Role', 'Set protein', 'Shapes', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'drug development', 'in vitro Assay', 'new technology', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'self assembly']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,274204,0.03243396970958431
"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,0.004416486995230966
"Dissecting the roles of superchaperones in type III secretion    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous Gram-negative bacteria including many NIAID Biodefense priority pathogens utilize type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to deliver tens of proteins into host cells. While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2). Insights gained from these studies will likely result in generating new directions for the development of novel agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases associated with Gram-negative bacterial infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many bacterial pathogens utilized a specialized secretion system to deliver virulence proteins directly into host cells.

"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Bar Domains and Neuronal Membrane Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed work is to systematically explore whether and how proteins that sense and shape the curvature of plasma membranes are responsible for building the intricate dendritic and axonal arbors that distinguish neurons from other cell types. The formation of complex 3-dimensional branched membrane structures is one of the most fundamental properties of neurons that enable them to transmit information between neurons and from neurons to other cell types. The ability of selected proteins to sense membrane curvature during this differentiation process is important as defects in proteins, such as Oligophrenin and srGAP2, that can bind to and shape lipid membranes cause neurodegenerative diseases. Our proposal aims to develop and execute a scalable experimental strategy to understand the process of arbor formation by focusing on a family of Bar domain containing proteins that are known from in vitro studies to be able to bind to and shape curved membranes. We will systematically investigate their function in generating the branched extended plasma membrane architecture of neurons.  Currently available in vitro assays and structural studies of proteins with membrane binding domains can determine the radius of the membrane curvature that results from the formation of oligomers by curvature sensing proteins. Using this approach, proteins have been identified that sense and shape membranes with positive and negative curvatures. Nevertheless, it is difficult from these assays to know to which curved intracellular membranes these proteins may bind, and if or how they act dynamically to generate distinct types of curved plasma membranes in a living cell.  We developed a novel assay to investigate curvature dependent processes that is based on fabricated nanostructures that trigger plasma membrane curvature in living cells. Specifically, our project will deliver a new scalable assay based on these nanostructures that allows one to measure in living cells the intracellular membrane localization and the curvature preference as well as the dynamic assembly, disassembly and exchange rate of curvature sensing membrane binding proteins. Our initial studies already identified and characterized a key regulator that binds to positively curved plasma membranes and is critically involved in controlling neuronal architecture. We have combined this approach with parallel high-throughput live-cell imaging and automated image analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons that enables us to systematically analyze the cellular roles of these same Bar domain binding proteins in controlling the neuronal architecture. At the center of our work is the development of this synergistic dual experimental approach that can ultimately be used as an unbiased and systematic platform to investigate the neuronal roles of a large number of putative neuronal membrane binding proteins. Together, our project will provide a molecular framework to understand the program used by neurons to create the vast repertoire of different neuronal architectures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The long term goal of the project is to understand the cellular mechanism of how neurons build the intricate dendritic and axonal branch structure that distinguishes them from other cell types.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7895064,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,291060,0.004416486995230966
"Data-Driven Approaches for Molecular Docking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular docking approaches for drug discovery are used for predicting ligand binding modes, ligand binding affinities, and for computational screening to identify new specific ligands for biological targets of pharmaceutical relevance. Current approaches are characterized by high inter-target variability and sharp limitations in ability to make accurate predictions for new ligands that are structurally different from known ones. Approaches that model protein flexibility directly or approach simulation-level detail in complex molecular systems have shown some success. However, they are generally applicable only in low throughput and in cases where high-quality experimentally determined protein target structures are available. This is in part why ""me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. Such drugs generally bring much less pharmacological novelty to patient treatment than structurally novel therapeutics. We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our recent work has established an approach to treating protein flexibility in docking that addresses large protein movements by considering multiple experimental structures and small ligand-dependent movements by protein/ligand complex relaxation beginning from many putative ligand dockings. We have also established an approach for de novo protein pocket induction that constructs a binding site based solely on ligand binding data that is capable of making accurate predictions of binding geometry and binding affinity for structurally novel ligands. Our proposed work will combine these approaches. In cases where protein structural information is available, experimentally determined structures will undergo additional sampling, followed by refinement of the binding pockets based on ligand binding data in order to improve the predictions obtained from docking based upon our existing methods developed for de novo pocket construction. In addition to data-driven pocket refinement, the proposed effort requires improvement in our scoring functions for docking, taking into account vastly more data and explicit modeling of protein flexibility and of the unbound states of proteins and ligands. We will also put significant effort into algorithmic improvements that will result in typical run-times on common single-processor hardware of several minutes per ligand to yield predictions of binding geometry and affinity. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice. These methods will facilitate identification of novel lead compounds from directed lead optimization and computational screening exercises. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Me-too"" drugs dominate the pharmaceutical marketplace and development pipeline. A shift toward novelty can be brought about if we can show that computational approaches for predicting the biological activity of small-molecules are able to make accurate predictions for structurally novel molecules. This requires significant advances over current methods for cases where a structure of the protein target is known (e.g. HIV pro- tease) and where one is not (e.g. the histamine receptor). We propose an integrated set of methods for molecular docking that treats protein flexibility in a serious manner, is computationally efficient enough for wide use, and which offers the opportunity to effectively use docking in cases where few experimental structures exist for a biological target of interest. Our proposed combines docking approaches with data-driven approaches that make use of ligand binding data. We will use ligand binding data (which is always available to some degree in drug discovery) to improve the predictions obtained from docking in cases where protein structures are known and can be expanded through sampling. These methods rely on a novel approach to machine learning, developed by our lab. We believe that a widely applicable, genuinely predictive, and computationally tractable modeling approach to docking will substantially improve drug discovery in practice.

"Type IV Secretion Determinants in Effector Proteins of Coxiella burnetii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transport of virulence factors from bacterium to the eukaryotic host cell has emerged as a fundamental strategy in pathogenesis. Several relevant Gram-negative pathogens use type IV secretion systems (T4SS) for 'effector' protein translocation. Coxiella burnetii, a Category B select agent and the causative agent of 'Q' fever is an obligate intracellular vacuolar parasite in vertebrates. After internalization by phagocytes, C.burnetii remodels its vacuole to replicate in a harsh phagolysosomal compartment, likely attributable to the translocation of effector proteins by a T4SS. Due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle, genetic manipulation of C.burnetii remains severely limited. Genomic information revealed however that C.burnetii harbors the genes encoding a T4SS found in Legionella pneumophila called Dot/Icm. Recent studies indicated that expression of C.burnetii (Cb) homologs of the dot/icm components IcmS and IcmW could complement intracellular growth defects of L.pneumophila (Lp) icmS or icmW mutants. We have established that IcmS and IcmW form a complex in the Legionella cytoplasm, and are important for early stages of substrate recognition. The goal of this study is to use L.pneumophila as a surrogate host for the characterization of specific secretion determinants of recently identified effector proteins from C.burnetii. Using molecular, genetic, and biochemical strategies, we will determine secretion signal signatures on Coxiella effector proteins, and define Cb IcmSW binding sites on Cb effectors. Determination of consensus secretion determinants will be applied to systematic computational approaches through the development of new search algorithms to identify novel effector proteins harbored on the C.burnetii genome. Outcomes from these studies will provide novel targets for antimicrobial development to combat critical stages of effector protein recognition and transport by the T4SS.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Q fever bacterium Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen whose lifestyle has impeded the development of reliable genetic tractability.

"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,0.00864497759630863
"Novel Schizophrenia Therapeutics By Virtual High-Throughput Screening    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Selective potentiators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5 have exciting potential for development of novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function. The latest generation of selective mGluR5 potentiators is based on the lead compound CDPPB and features systemically active compounds with long half-lives that cross the blood-brain barrier.      A high-throughput screen (HTS) for mGluR5 potentiators at Vanderbilts NIH-funded molecular libraries screening center network facility revealed a large and diverse set of about 1400 substances whose activity was validated in independent experiments. The present ChemInformatics proposal targets utilizing the power of recent machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to model the complex relationship between chemical structure and biological activity of mGluR5 potentiators reflected in the HTS results. An innovative encoding scheme is developed that allows mapping of the diverse chemical space into a single mathematical model. The resulting Quantitative Structure Activity Relation (QSAR) models will serve a three-fold purpose: (a) a comprehensive binding site pharmacophore will be obtained to facilitate understanding of the SAR and rationalize further experiments; (b) the models will be used to virtually screen libraries of millions of compounds which are known but not physically available for HTS at Vanderbilt to gain a priority list for acquisition or synthesis; and (c) in combination with an existing Genetic Algorithm (GA) structure generator existing lead compounds will be optimized and new structures will be designed to identify potential new targets for synthesis.      Overall we hope to not only identify novel allosteric potentiators of mGluR5 and understand their activity as potential treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders that disrupt cognitive function, but also to build an innovative ChemInformatics software and database tool which can be adopted for research in other NIH molecular libraries screening centers. The developed applications will be made freely and readily accessible for academic research using a WWW interface deeply integrated in the drug development pipeline. The employed QSAR models require no crystal structure of the target protein. Hence the method can be readily applied to membrane proteins-such as GPCRs-which are target of 40-50% of modern medicinal drugs.      The PI of the proposal has extensive experience in the usage of ANNs and SVMs to predict properties of organic molecules and proteins (1-9), solve protein structures (10-15), and predict activity of therapeutics (16). He implemented GAs for the design and optimization of chemical structures (17,18).

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7787322,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,294000,0.004416486995230966
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays. We also plan to test 100 lower ranking sites to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our algorithms. We will also develop an oligo competition assay as a new approach to increase the throughput of experimental motif analysis for the rest of the genome.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7239477,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2007,318904,0.00864497759630863
"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,0.009729732720636994
"Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the proposed work, we will develop software tools to predict T- and B-cell epitopes of allergenic and viral proteins. The approach is based on novel quantitative descriptors of the physical-chemical properties of amino acids developed recently by our group. The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,7176188,R01AI064913,"['Accounting', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Allergens', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Databases', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Descriptor', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Design', 'Endopeptidases', 'Epitopes', 'Escape Mutant', 'Flavivirus', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Histamine Release', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immunotherapy', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Proteins', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical property', 'computerized tools', 'env Gene Products', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'practical application', 'protein structure', 'response', 'software development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'vaccine development']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2007,286350,0.023987086425346568
"2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Large, integrin-binding proteins such as collagens, fibronectin, and thrombospondin are integral parts of established matrices and are generally discussed at other GRC meetings. Smaller integrin-binding proteins perform many functions other than those of structural scaffolding. One class of small, integrin-binding proteins encoded by five genes clustered on human chromosome 4 are called the SIBLING (small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein) family. Members include bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein, and osteopontin. Normally expressed by skeletal tissue, SIBLINGs are thought to play a role in mineralization as well as cellular adhesion and migration. Specific SIBLINGs are also induced in a number of different cancer types including breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and thyroid cancers. Individual SIBLING family members have been found to promote angiogenesis and invasiveness. A second small integrinbinding gene family is the connective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma overexpressed (CCN) family of proteins. Members of the CNN family contain a conserved insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein motif and are secreted extracellular matrix proteins. CCNs are involved in diverse biological processes such as regulation of cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation and survival. They play important roles in pregnancy, development, angiogenesis, wound repair and inflammation. Certain CCN genes appear to act as tumor-promoting factors, while other CCNs exhibits suppressive capabilities. The focus of this Gordon Research Conference is on defining state-of-the-art knowledge of the biological activities, biochemical interactions and physiological consequences of small-integrin binding proteins in normal and pathological states. This application has as its specific aims to: (1) Convene an international group of experts on SIBLING and CCN biology; (2) Through multidisciplinary presentations determine the state of the art knowledge on small integrin binding proteins in normal physiological function and cancer pathology; (3) Facilitate cross-fertilization of multiple fields (biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, inflammation, the SIBLING and CCN fields); and (4) spark translational opportunities in the development of novel ways to use SIBLINGs/CCNs as markers for pathological states and discuss therapeutic applications. These aims are directly relevant to the mission of the NIH. The format follows the standard template for a Gordon Research Conference, with an evening introductory evening session, followed by 4 days of morning sessions, late afternoon poster sessions and evening talks in an environment facilitating the open, unhampered discussion of ideas at the frontiers of science. The principal topics to be addressed are: intracellular processing and function of SIBLINGs/CCNs; genetic regulation of SIBLING and CCN genes; SIBLINGs and CCNs in cancer and inflammation; and bioactive fragments of SIBLINGs/CCNs.              n/a",2007 Small Intergin Binding Proteins Gordon Research Conference,7329283,R13HL090059,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Arts', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Breast', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cellular biology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Class', 'Collagen', 'Colon', 'Cysteine', 'DSPP gene', 'Dentin', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Fertilization', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Genus Cola', 'Glycoproteins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin-Like Growth-Factor-Binding Proteins', 'Integrin Binding', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Mission', 'Molecular Biology', 'NOV gene', 'Nephroblastoma', 'Numbers', 'Pancreas', 'Pathology', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protein Family', 'Protein Overexpression', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Siblings', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wound Healing', 'angiogenesis', 'bone sialoprotein', 'cancer type', 'connective tissue growth factor', 'day', 'frontier', 'member', 'migration', 'mineralization', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oncology', 'osteopontin', 'posters', 'scaffold', 'symposium', 'tumor']",NHLBI,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2007,5000,0.04465276850533118

"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids.

The primary goal of the new approach is to use a minimal number of variables to establish the classification procedures and QSAR models. The novel descriptors of physical-chemical properties of amino acids will be used in combination with a partial least squares approach to reduce the number of variables in the discriminant analysis and in artificial neural networks. Algorithms based on multivariate classification, K-nearest-neighbor methods, support vector machines and neural networks will be developed and assessed by cross-validation for their ability to predict T- and B-cell epitopes in proteins. The resulting QSAR models/database approach can then be used to identify immunogenic epitopes in the proteins of pathogens for vaccine development and drug design. IgE epitopes, archived in our web-based, relational Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins (SDAP), will be used to develop the Bcell epitope prediction methods. Stereochemical variability plots will also be used to predict functional and immunological determinants on proteins from Dengue virus (DV). This information can aid in the design of vaccines that better stimulate neutralizing T- and B-cell responses to diverse variants of DV. The validated suite of software tools to identify and classify immunogenic peptides will be made available to the scientific community as a Web server, similar to SDAP. Collaborations with experimental groups will enable the practical applications of the tools, which include predicting the allergenicity of novel foods and drugs, improving specific immunotherapies for allergy and asthma, and vaccine design. n/a",Computational tools for T- and B-cell epitope prediction,6916795,R01AI064913,"['B lymphocyte', 'T lymphocyte', 'allergens', 'aminoacid', 'antigens', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'chemical property', 'chemical structure', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dengue virus', 'immunoglobulin E', 'major histocompatibility complex', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'peptides', 'physical property', 'protein binding', 'stereochemistry', 'structural biology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MEDICAL BR GALVESTON,R01,2005,264250,0.023987086425346568
"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine. As a first application of new motifs found using these approaches, I will perform hypothesis-directed sequence analysis to reconcile differences between in vivo binding and the organization of binding sites in promoters.

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,6959048,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2005,162000,0.009729732720636994
"Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physiological control of the concentration of free fatty acid levels is central to human physiology. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), a large superfamily of proteins found abundantly in many cell types, have been shown to play a role in the organism's ability to control fatty acid levels by selectively binding fatty acids. The details of the ability of these proteins to select fatty acids, based on chain length, saturation state, and headgroup type, is not clear at a molecular level. This is despite the existence of two central ingredients required for such an explanation: highly detailed structures (Banaszak and Cistola) and excellent binding thermodynamics (Kleinfeld). We aim, through this grant proposal, to provide the third needed ingredient for a detailed molecular description of binding. That is, our overall goal is the ability to compute the selective binding of fatty acids within fatty acid binding proteins. We approach this goal through three specific aims. Our first aim is to understand the basis of fatty acid solvation in the homogenous solvents water and octanol. This will provide a reference point for the changes to a heterogeneous environment provided by the fatty acid binding protein and considered in the next two aims. In the second aim, we will directly compute the relative free energy differences underlying discrimination of fatty acids afforded by the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP). In the third aim we will draw connections between our calculations and the site directed mutants that have been characterized in the Kleinfeld lab. Throughout these aims we will use alchemical mutagenesis calculations with a range of solvation models. In particular, we will be testing new models for solvation developed in the Roux lab. The work will further involve extending our own approaches to relative free energy calculations through dynamic importance sampling, analysis of non-equilibrium work events, extrapolations from histogram analysis and intelligent stepping algorithms along the alchemical reaction coordinate. If we succeed in our long term goal, we will have achieved the ability to rationally design new protein binding interactions enabling discrimination of particular fatty acids. The achievement of this goal would have implications for rational treatment of heart disease and other, e.g. digestive system related, human diseases that involve the control of free fatty acid levels.     n/a",Structure and Affinity: Computing FABP-Lipid Selectivity,6744140,R01GM064746,"['alanine', 'alcohols', 'artificial intelligence', 'chemical models', 'fatty acid binding protein', 'fatty acid transport', 'fatty acids', 'gene mutation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lipid bilayer membrane', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein structure function', 'site directed mutagenesis', 'thermodynamics', 'water']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,271319,0.07705420395471012

"A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this work is to provide a novel probabilistic computational engine for docking-based virtual screening. The engine is based on probabilistic model of Markov Random Fieds (MRF). MRF's have proven successful in other fields such as Computer Vision, and can be seen as a 3D analog of the successful 1D application of Hidden Markov Models to bioinformatics. The docking of a rigid ligand or ligand fragment into a protein active site is modeled as a weighted graphical match of an abstracted description of the ligand to an abstracted description of the active site. These abstracted descriptions are graphs, whose nodes are chemical entities (hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, hydrophobic spheres and etc.) and whose edges are associated distance constraints. The weighted graph-matching problem is expressed as an MRF, whose solution minimizes its associated free energy function. A fast, convergent message-passing scheme called Belief Propagation is used to solve the MRF. The result is a probability distribution that describes all possible placements of the ligand into the active site. Individual low-energy placements of the molecule are obtained by marginalizing this probability distribution. The method provides a fast and mathematically complete examination of possible fits of the ligand into the protein active site, and our prototype MRF application demonstrates excellent timing and completeness properties. The method also provides an attractive data structure enabling a variety of applications. The data structure intrinsically admits an enriched description of the active site. This description can incorporate an extended set of chemical substructures for matching at its nodes. It also can incorporate sets of probabilistic beliefs, expressed as probabilistic prior distributions. These can be used to bias matches according to known actives. Our goals in Phase I are to further develop our prototype into a robust MRF-based docking engine to positioning rigid molecules and molecular fragments into protein active sites. Our goals in Phase II will be to implement applications based on the MRF docking engine: (i) inclusion flexible ligand docking, (ii) incorporation of flexible side chains into docking, (iii) de-novo ligand design, and (iv) docking into multiple aligned proteins. We will seek corporate partners interested in collaborating on applying the technologies to specific problems in drug discovery in Phase I1. The technology developed will be sold as commercial software in Phase III. n/a",A Novel Probabilistic Engine for Virtual Screening,6786885,R43GM071055,"['binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ligands', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,"BIOCOMPUTING GROUP, INC.",R43,2004,153420,-0.023546254163196348

"Improving Quantum Chemistry Calculations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the functionality of our commercial quantum chemistry program, Q-Chem, to effectively treat molecules containing transition metals. This enhanced capability will provide Q-Chem's end-users with the ability to accurately model complex molecules such as proteins, enzymes, and catalysts of industrial importance. While remarkable progress has been made over the last several years in the accurate modeling of systems containing transition metals, current numerical methods for achieving SCF convergence in these systems are problematic at best, resulting in long execution times or, in some cases, complete failure to find a solution. However, a novel computational technique developed at Q-Chem has been shown to dramatically improve convergence for organic molecules with known SCF convergence problems. We propose to adapt this method for use with transition metals. Our goal is to achieve the same robust SCF convergence that is realized for most organic molecules, thereby greatly increasing productivity and extending the capability of scientists to study molecules such as enzymes and industrial catalysts. During Phase (I, our efforts will be to further extend Q-Chem's capability in the molecular biology arena. This proposal seeks to improve the quantum chemical treatment of molecular systems containing transition metals. Transition metal elements are essential to natural biological processes. The technology developed in this research will enable the computer modeling of those systems that are difficult to handle with the current methodologies and therefore increase of the applications of computational modeling. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: Transition-metal elements play a vital role in biological systems.  The success of this project will improve the performance of modeling of transition-metal complexes and making the modelings possible for the systems that current algorithms fail.

"Structure based prediction of protein modifications  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genomics revolution has uncovered tens of thousands of proteins, nonetheless full exploitation of organismal genome projects will not occur without innovations in proteomics and structural biology. The agencies meeting this challenge, such as the seven NIH protein structure consortia , have targeted 10,000 new protein structures to be solved by 2010. We propose to use this powerfully enabling structural dataset as the basis for a new type of bioinformatic tool which models and compares the surfaces of proteins, instead of their sequence or backbone path, by analogy to sequence comparison methods. An algorithm that searches a protein's sw-lace features for post-translational modification and binding sites will offer a large step forward. The ability to model protein binding sites will allow investigators to predict how they interact, how regulatory networks are organized, and what determines the order of metabolic pathways--each a fundamental goal of much research. Cognia is well positioned to undertake this effort as we are currently building databases and tools designed to identify drug targets and biotherapeutic candidates for use in both basic research and pharmaceutical-biotech discovery. Our use of predictive tools to analyze, organize, and synthesize the content of databases lends direction to this proposal, and its near-term focus will involve the analysis of post-translational modifications such as the ubiquitylation and SUMOylation accomplished by E3 enzymes during the cell cycle. We anticipate that algorithms developed under this proposal will have many applications, including the ability to (I) predict novel binding interactions of structurally defined proteins (ii) identify structural homologs of proteins not apparent by sequence or backbone similarity searches (iii) define an enzyme's potential substrates, (iv) define structural features of binding sites. In Phase I, we will gather the requisite data and structures and carry out a pilot definition of an E3's consensus binding site. This will provide the foundation for Phase II, where we will create a tool that will scan all known structures for consensi, predicting interactions and modifications.   n/a",Structure based prediction of protein modifications,6551328,R43GM066514,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' posttranslational modifications', ' protein binding', ' protein metabolism', ' protein protein interaction', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,COGNIA CORPORATION,R43,2002,96725,-0.02715500885669745

"Synergistic integration of topology and machine learning for the predictions of protein-ligand binding affinities and mutation impacts Project Summary Fundamental challenges that hinder the current understanding of biomolecular systems are their tremendous complexity, high dimensionality and excessively large data sets associated with their geometric modeling and simulations. These challenges call for innovative strategies for handling massive biomolecular datasets. Topology, in contrast to geometry, provides a unique tool for dimensionality reduction and data simplification. However, traditional topology typically incurs with excessive reduction in geometric information. Persistent homology is a new branch of topology that is able to bridge traditional topology and geometry, but suffers from neglecting biological information. Built upon PI’s recent work in the topological data analysis of biomolecules, this project will explore how to integrate topological data analysis and machine learning to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art predictions of protein-ligand binding and mutation impact established in the PI’s preliminary studies. These improvements will be achieved through developing physics-embedded topological methodologies and advanced deep learning architectures for tackling heterogeneous biomolecular data sets arising from a variety of physical and biological considerations. Finally, the PI will establish robust databases and online servers for the proposed predictions.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures.

"Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning Project Summary / Abstract This proposal is entitled “Binding-Site Modeling with Multiple-Instance Machine-Learning.” A number of in- terrelated computational methods for making predictions about the biological behavior of small molecules have been the subject of development within the Jain Laboratory for over twenty years. These share a common strat- egy that considers molecular interactions at their surface interface, where proteins and ligands actually interact. These methods yield measurements of similarity between small molecules or between protein binding pockets. They also yield measurements of the complementarity of a small molecule to a protein binding site (the molecular docking problem). A generalization of these concepts makes possible the construction of a virtual binding site for quantitative activity prediction purely from data about the biological activities of a set of small molecules.  The goals of the proposed work include further improving the accuracy and breadth of applicability of the binding site modeling approach. The primary application of the approach is to guide optimization of leads within medicinal chemistry projects, and to quantify potential off-target effects during pre-clinical drug discovery.  A critical focus of the work will be in data and software dissemination, in order to accelerate the efficient development of targeted therapies. In addition to methods development, the proposed work will involve broad application of these state-of-the-art predictive modeling methods. The proposed work will proceed with the col- laborative input of our pharmaceutical industry colleagues, who have specialized knowledge and data sets that are vital for cutting-edge work in computer-aided drug design.  The expected results include more efficient lead optimization (fewer compounds to reach desired biological pa- rameters), truly effective scaffold replacement (to move away from a molecular series with biological limitations), and improved computational predictions of off-target effects during pre-clinical drug design. Project Narrative This project seeks to refine an integrated platform for physically realistic prediction of ligand binding affinities using multiple methods that span small molecule molecular similarity, molecular docking, and protein binding site similarity. These tools will provide predictive modeling unrestrained by scaffold congruence between what is known and what is to be predicted.

"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,0.002711572776103854
"Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We cannot yet look at a chemical structure and predict if the molecule will have an odor, much less what character it will have. The goal of the proposed research is to apply machine learning to predict perceptual characteristics from chemical features of molecules. The specific aims of the proposal will determine (1) which molecules are odorous , and (2) what data are needed to model odor character. Building a highly predictive model requires two key ingredients: high-quality data and a sound modeling approach. High-quality data must be accurate (ratings are consistent and describe true odor properties) and detailed (ratings describe even small differences in odor properties). We have collected human psychophysical data on a diverse set of molecules and have trained a model to predict if a molecule has an odor, but pilot data identified odorous contaminants that limit model training and measurement of model accuracy. In Aim 1, I will apply my background in analytical chemistry to evaluate the accuracy of the data, using gas chromatography to identify and correct errors caused by chemical contaminants. In Aim 2, I will apply my experience in human sensory evaluation to measure and compare the consistency and the degree of detail in ratings that can be achieved with different sensory methods and subject training procedures. By executing my training plan, I will develop the skills in statistical programming and machine learning needed to employ a sound modeling approach to these problems. The model constructed in Aim 1 will enable prediction of odor classification (odor/odorless) for any molecule and thus define which molecules are perceptually relevant. Predicting odor character is a far more complex challenge – while a molecule can have only one of two odor classifications (odor or odorless) it may elicit any number of diverse odor character attributes (fruity, floral, musky, sweet, etc.). Descriptive Analysis (DA) is the gold standard method for generating accurate and detailed sensory profiles, but this method is time-consuming. We estimate that an odor character dataset will be large enough (“model-ready”) to predict odor character with approximately 10,000 molecules and that it would require more than 30,000 hours of human subject evaluation, or approximately 6 years for the typical trained panel, to produce this dataset using DA. Before we invest the time and resources, it is responsible to evaluate the relative data quality of more rapid sensory methods. The results of Aim 2 are expected to determine the best approach for generating a model-ready dataset by quantifying trade-offs in degree of detail (data resolution), rating consistency, and method speed of five candidate sensory methods. Together, these aims represent a significant step forward in linking chemical recipe to human odor perception, an advancement that supports the NIDCD goal of understanding normal olfactory function (how stimulus relates to percept) and has many potential applications in foods (what composition of molecules should be present to produce a target aroma percept). PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, scientists cannot predict whether a molecule will have an odor and, if so, what odor characteristics it will have based on its chemical structure. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models linking chemical composition to odor characteristics. These models will advance our understanding of the human olfactory system and help design strategies for improving the aroma and palatability of healthy foods.",Using machine learning to predict odor characteristics from molecular structure,10142097,F32DC019030,"['Address', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Characteristics', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Fruit', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Food', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Palate', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Programmed Learning', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Quality Control', 'Recipe', 'Research', 'Research Technics', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'food science', 'human subject', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model building', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'skills', 'sound']",NIDCD,MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES CENTER,F32,2020,67446,0.03047258166472245
"EVOLVING VIRUS-SPECIFIC sACE2 MIMICS FOR COMPETITIVE INHIBITION OF SARS-CoV-2 PROJECT SUMMARY The rapid spread of the highly-pathogenic, novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global health emergency. Thus, there is a desperate need for effective antiviral therapeutics to counteract this virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters cells using the ACE2 receptor1 which binds the viral spike protein2. In its soluble form, ACE2 (sACE2) has the potential to be used as a stable and non-immunogenic competitive inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 and is presently being explored in clinical trials3. Due to the potential negative side effects of anti-spike mAbs18, and the fact that ACE2 exhibits other biological roles4–6 including integrin signaling regulation7,8, spike-specific receptor mimics would yield novel therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other highly infectious diseases. This proposal seeks to use machine learning and directed evolution to develop high affinity, yet endogenously-inactive mimics of sACE2 in order to create rapidly implementable therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 and potential corona-like viruses. This approach would allow for the generation of scalable and translatable biologics, and provide a platform to rapidly course-correct for potential mutations that may arise in the future. Utilizing deep-learning with UniRep49, will design and generate sACE2 variants that tightly bind the SARS-CoV2-2 spike protein but do not cross-interact with endogenous targets such as integrins [Aim 1]. Simultaneously, we will perform directed evolution to optimize spike-binding and select against variants that bind endogenous proteins [Aim 2]. Finally, we will identify lead candidates and evaluate the tolerance and immunogenicity of engineered sACE2 variants in mice [Aim 3]. Collectively, this proposal will develop highly-specific ACE2 receptor mimics in order to create novel antivirals with minimal immunogenicity in time to save lives and prevent future outbreaks. 10 Project Narrative There is desperate need for novel, effective, and scalable antiviral medicines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a soluble version of that receptor is being explored in clinical trials as a potential “competitive inhibitor”: the virus will bind to the decoy instead of the real receptor. The goal of this project is to combine computational and laboratory evolution to create superior receptor decoys that more tightly bind to the virus but don't affect any other functions of the human body, enabling them to be safely delivered at high levels with minimal side effects.",EVOLVING VIRUS-SPECIFIC sACE2 MIMICS FOR COMPETITIVE INHIBITION OF SARS-CoV-2,10175307,R21AI158169,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Albumins', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Inhibitors', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'deep learning', 'design', 'global health emergency', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'lead candidate', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'side effect']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,399346,0.016856271094710447
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,9926115,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,491993,-0.005681597226329559
"Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY The research interests of my group are rooted in explorations of new and useful conceptual models to improve the control and prediction of noncovalent interactions. Our research involves the use of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools, applications of density functional theory (DFT), cheminformatics, and machine-learning methods. A premise of our research is that aromaticity may be used to modulate many types of noncovalent interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, π-stacking, anion-π interactions). The reciprocal relationship we find, between “aromaticity” in molecules and the strengths of “noncovalent interactions,” is surprising especially since they are typically considered as largely separate ideas in chemistry. The innovation of this research is that it will enable use of intuitive “back-of-the-envelope” electron-counting rules (such as the 4n+2πe Hückel rule for aromaticity) to make predictions of experimental outcomes regarding the impact of noncovalent interactions. A five-year goal is to realize the use of our conceptual models in real synthetic examples prepared by our experimental collaborators. My research vision is to bridge discoveries of innovative concepts to their practical impacts for biomedical and biomolecular research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research proposal includes four projects that are jointly motivated by the challenge to control and predict noncovalent interactions in organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed work involves applications of a variety of computational quantum chemical tools and synergistic investigations with experimental collaborators. We seek to identify new and useful concepts to guide experimental designs of novel “non-natural” molecular systems (e.g., receptors, biosensors, and hydrogels) that have potential biomedical applications.",Computational Explorations of Unconventional Approaches to Control Noncovalent Interactions,10016376,R35GM133548,"['Anions', 'Back', 'Biosensor', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Electrons', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Hydrogels', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Plant Roots', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Research Proposals', 'System', 'Vision', 'Work', 'cheminformatics', 'density', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'quantum computing', 'receptor', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R35,2020,377200,0.013538020337780086
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately.

The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10005389,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,320588,0.034409093875653426
"Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention Project Summary/Abstract Viruses are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) being one of the most infectious and prevalent among them. Roughly 250 million people worldwide suffer from chronic HBV infection, including 1-2 million in the United States. Of those infected, approximately 15-25% will develop se- rious liver problems, including cirrhosis, cancer, and ultimately failure, leading to 600,000 deaths annually. While therapies exist to manage chronic HBV infection, all target viral genomic processes such as reverse transcription and DNA replication, and none provide a cure due to viral persistence and resistance. A promising orthogonal approach to eliminating infection is to target HBV's capsid, the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome. The Finn laboratory has previously developed compounds that induce the misdirected assembly of non-functional HBV capsids, showing that small molecules have the power to affect the structures of these large multi-protein assemblies. While much is known about the structures of the intermolecular interactions with these compounds identiﬁed after the fact, little about the dynamics of such interactions has been explored, and a predictive under- standing of functional (antiviral) binding has yet to be developed. Both deﬁciencies will begin to be addressed in this program. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with in vitro experiments on HepAD38 cells, the PIs have identiﬁed seven compounds based on motifs previously unknown to interact with HBV that target the capsid assembly process. These compounds bind in a known pocket at the interface of two capsid-protein (Cp) dimers, possess moderate antiviral activity, and low toxicity. In the ﬁrst aim, using docking, free-energy perturba- tion, and synthetic chemistry, the PIs will optimize the lead compound to improve its efﬁcacy against HBV. In the second aim, using molecular dynamics simulations, advanced free-energy calculations, and experimental assays on different HBV protein oligomers, up to and including the whole virus capsid, the PIs will determine how small molecules interfere with capsid assembly. Both aims will beneﬁt from using a machine-learning-based classiﬁ- cation scheme as well as novel enhanced sampling methods. The lessons learned here concerning how small molecules can re-direct the assembly pathway into unproductive conformations can be generalized for application to other viruses. Project Narrative In spite of the dramatic increase in our understanding of the structure and properties of hepatitis B virus (HBV), this pathogen remains a major threat to human health. That knowledge also makes HBV an important test case for new antiviral strategies. This project aims to limit the impact of HBV by using computer simulations and synthetic chemistry to develop an improved understanding of the assembly process of HBV as well as new drugs that can eliminate HBV infection in ways that may be generalized to other pathogenic viruses.",Altering Hepatitis B Virus assembly through pharmacological intervention,10051923,R01AI148740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Capsid', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cations', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis B', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Encapsulated', 'Equilibrium', 'Failure', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Health', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'dimer', 'drug development', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'intermolecular interaction', 'lead optimization', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'programs', 'protein oligomer', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'success', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,407510,-0.015472027245115835
"Computer Simulations of Enzymes Computer simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) and the combined quantum  mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach are capable of describing structures and dynamics  of proteins and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. An accurate and  computationally efficient energy function is necessary. However, challenges remain: the  accuracy of QM method, the compatibility between the electron density of the QM subsystem and  classical force fields for the MM subsystem, and the cost of ab initio QM/MM methods capitalizing  on the accuracy and reliability of the associated QM approaches. To address these challenges, we  have developed a series of ab initio QM/MM approaches on reaction path optimizations and free  energy calculations, the QM/MM minimum free-energy path (QM/MM-MFEP) and the QM/MM neural  network (QM/MM-NN) methods. This proposal aims to develop further the ab initio QM/MM methodology  and its applications to the studies of redox processes in important enzymes, and the construction  of ab initio force fields combined with neural network representations. Our long-term goals are to develop and establish accurate first-principles based and density  functional theory (DFT) based MD and QM/MM simulation as an equal partner with experiments for the  study of enzymes and proteins and to provide insight into chemical and redox processes in  biological systems. Our aims are as follows: (1) We aim to make ab initio QM/MM models for much  more accurate QM/MM energies, for the QM description and for the electrostatic and vdW interactions   between the QM and MM subsystems. (2) We aim to develop a combined computational  model to explore the key molecular determinants of the reduction potential variability in  metalloproteins. We will provide detailed insight into chemical and redox reaction mechanisms in  biological systems, in particular laccases. (3) We aim at the development of accurate  force fields of water, and proteins for simulations in biological applications, going beyond the  traditional force field forms and limitation in accuracy. The proposed developments will capitalize on the theoretical developments in quantum  electronic theory, such as the linear response theory and accurate many-electron approach for  non-covalent interactions, and leverage machine-learning methods in data science for biological  system simulations. The proposed work will lead to the major advancement of the ab initio QM/MM  method and force fields, and insights into the structure-function paradigm for proteins  and important redox process and reaction mechanisms in enzymes. In addition, it will also lead to  methodology development for design of new drugs and enzyme inhibitors. Understanding chemical reactions and redox processes in solution and in enzymes is of critical  importance, because the structure-function relationship and the catalytic role of enzymes  are fundamental insights in biochemical research, and they are essential for the development of  new or better inhibitors and enzymes. Quantitative tools such as simulations make key contributions  to the investigation of the structure-function relationship, complementing experimental studies.  This proposal aims at developing methods for simulating structures and dynamics in proteins, and  chemical and redox processes catalyzed by enzymes, and investigating the mechanisms of  important enzymes-copper protein laccases, leading to significant advances in research tools for  studying enzymes and contributing to the understanding of life processes, as well as aiding in the  design of inhibitors and drugs.",Computer Simulations of Enzymes,10001530,R01GM061870,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biophysical Process', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copper', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Electrons', 'Electrostatics', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Laccase', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mechanics', 'Metalloproteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Potential Energy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'chemical reaction', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'electron density', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intermolecular interaction', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'neural network', 'novel therapeutics', 'perturbation theory', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,360797,-0.010932393633864744
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,0.0324819562682951
"Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria PROJECT SUMMARY Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing in incidence and novel antibiotics are urgently needed to combat this growing threat to public health. A major roadblock to the development of novel antibiotics is our poor understanding of the structural features of small molecules that correlate with bacterial penetration and efflux. As a result, while potent biochemical inhibitors can often be identified for new targets, developing them into compounds with whole-cell antibacterial activity has proven challenging. To address this critical problem, we propose herein a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to develop quantitative models to predict small-molecule penetration and efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. We have pioneered a general platform for systematic, quantitative evaluation of small-molecule accumulation in bacteria, using label-free LC-MS/MS detection and multivariate cheminformatic analysis. We have also developed unique isogenic strain sets of wild-type, hyperporinated, efflux-knockout, and doubly-compromised E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii that allow us to dissect the individual contributions of outer/inner membrane penetration and active efflux to net accumulation, using a kinetic model that accurately recapitulates available experimental data. Moreover, we have developed machine learning and neural network approaches to QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) modeling of pharmacological properties that will now be used to develop predictive cheminformatic models for Gram-negative accumulation, penetration, and efflux. This project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary SPEAR-GN Project Team (Small-molecule Penetration & Efflux in Antibiotic-Resistant Gram-Negatives, “speargun”) involving the labs of Derek Tan (MSK, PI), Helen Zgurskaya (OU, PI), Bradley Sherborne (Merck, Lead Collaborator), Valentin Rybenkov (OU, Co-I), Adam Duerfeldt (OU, Co-I), Carl Balibar (Merck, Collaborator), and David McLaren (Merck, Collaborator), comprising extensive combined expertise in organic and diversity-oriented synthesis, biochemistry, microbiology, high- throughput screening, mass spectrometry, biophysical modeling, cheminformatics, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we will design and synthesize chemical libraries with diverse structural and physicochemical properties; analyze their accumulation in the isogenic strain sets in both high-throughput and high-density assay formats; extract kinetic parameters for penetration and efflux from the resulting experimental datasets; develop and validate robust QSAR models for accumulation, penetration, and efflux; and demonstrate the utility of these models in medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel Gram-negative antibiotics against three targets. This project will provide a major advance in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing powerful enabling tools to the scientific community to address this major threat to public health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria. Antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pose a growing threat to public health in the U.S. and globally. A major obstacle to the development of new antibiotics to combat such infections is our poor understanding of the chemical requirements for small molecules to enter Gram-negative cells and to avoid ejection by efflux pumps. The proposed comprehensive, multidisciplinary research program aims to develop predictive computational tools to identify such molecules by carrying out large-scale, quantitative analyses of the accumulation of diverse small molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. These tools will then enable medicinal chemistry campaigns to develop novel antibiotics.",Predictive Models for Small-Molecule Accumulation in Gram-Negative Bacteria,9982190,R01AI136795,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Partner in relationship', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Property', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Role', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'analog', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'cell envelope', 'cheminformatics', 'combat', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'kinetic model', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2020,1239304,0.00880488020285981
"Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The study of biomolecular interactions and design of new therapeutics requires accurate physical models of the atomistic interactions between small molecules and biological macromolecules. Over the least few decades, molecular mechanics force ﬁelds have demonstrated the potential that physical models hold for quantitative biophysical modeling and predictive molecular design. However, a signiﬁcant technology gap exists in our ability to build force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy, can be systematically improved in a statistically robust manner, be extended to new areas of chemistry, can model post-translational and covalent modiﬁcations, are able to quantify systematic errors in predictions, and can be broadly applied across a high-performance software packages. In this project, we willl bridge this technology gap to enable new generations of accurate quantitative biomolec- ular modeling and (bio)molecular design for chemical biology and drug discovery. In Aim 1, we will produce a modern, open infrastructure to enable practitioners to rapidly and conveniently construct and employ accurate and statistically robust physical force ﬁelds via automated machine learning methods. In Aim 2, we will construct open, machine-readable experimental and quantum chemical datasets that will accelerate next-generation force ﬁeld development. In Aim 3, we will develop statistically robust Bayesian inference techniques to enable the auto- mated construction of type assignment schemes that avoid overﬁtting and selection of physical functional forms statistically justﬁed by the data. This approach will also provide an estimate of the systematic error in predicted properties arising from uncertainty in parameters or functional form choices—generally the dominant source of error—to be quantiﬁed with little added expense. In Aim 4, we will integrate and apply this infrastructure to produce open, transferable, self-consistent force ﬁelds that achieve high accuracy and broad coverage for modeling small molecule interactions with biomolecules (including unnatural amino or nucleic acids and covalent modiﬁcations by organic molecules), with the ultimate goal of covering all major biomolecules. This research is signiﬁcant in that the technology developed in this project has the potential to radically transform the study of biomolecular phenomena by providing highly accurate force ﬁelds with exceptionally broad chemical coverage via fully consistent parameterization of organic (bio)molecules. In addition, we will produce new tools to automate force ﬁeld creation and tailoring to speciﬁc problem domains, quantify the systematic error in predictions, and identify new data for improving force ﬁeld accuracy. This will greatly improve our ability to study diverse biophysical processes at the molecular level, and to rationally design new small-molecule, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics.

We aim to greatly increase the utility of all of these simulations by improving the accuracy of the formulas they use to compute the forces acting between atoms.",Open data-driven infrastructure for building biomolecular force fields for predictive biophysics and drug design,9887804,R01GM132386,"['Address', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Electrostatics', 'Ensure', 'Error Sources', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Occupations', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biophysical model', 'chemical synthesis', 'cheminformatics', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'macromolecule', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleic acid-based therapeutics', 'open data', 'open source', 'physical model', 'physical property', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO,R01,2020,675565,0.027980053996308644
"A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads Abstract Significance: To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of human coronavirus. Better, direct-acting anti-viral drugs and accelerated methods for identifying them are desperately needed. Having a large body of diverse fragment binding simulation data for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target represents a unique opportunity to accelerate preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 protein inhibitors. In contrast to testing-based approaches, understanding fragment interaction patterns provides chemists specific mechanistic information to guide lead optimization. We propose to (1) create comprehensive fragment maps for the full suite of SARS-CoV-2 proteins; (2) build automated tools for enumeration and evaluation of compounds that address protease selectivity and inhibition at Spike protein ppi and allosteric sites; and (3) make these available worldwide through the BMaps Web application. As such, all anti-viral researchers can benefit. Innovation: Generating thousands of fragment binding patterns for each of the known SARS-CoV-2 protein structures is a novel scientific approach to the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. This would be the largest data source of fragment data on SARS-CoV-2 drug targets available and the resource would be accessible by all scientists working to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The innovation proposed is to enable a new scientific approach to rational design for SARS-CoV-2 antivirals based on the analysis of fragment binding patterns using novel compound enumeration and evaluation methods. Aim 1: Generate fragment and water maps for the full suite of proteins involved in the coronavirus life cycle. Using hot spots for location bias, run ~1,000 fragment simulations on each consensus of 6 structures from molecular dynamics. Aim 2: Develop automated tools to accelerate the enumeration and evaluation of candidate inhibitor molecules. Two approaches are proposed: (1) adapt our test software to enumerate all available modifications with all fragments for a given starting point and (2) use a Conditional GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) deep learning network to enumerate inhibitors from fragments, using discriminator networks to bias towards synthesizable molecules with good properties. Aim 3. Build a repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins through a variety of different mechanisms. Overall Impact: The SARS-CoV-2 protein-fragment maps lead chemists to often non-obvious ideas to progress their compounds toward clinical trials. The ability to automatically enumerate and evaluate compounds from a large fragment map repository enables broad access to target-relevant chemical diversity, without tedious manual searching. A repository of candidate inhibitors targeting coronavirus proteins enables drug researchers to get started quickly. Project Narrative Accessing diverse chemical fragment binding data (1,000s for each SARS-CoV-2 drug target) presents a unique opportunity to accelerate much needed preclinical drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The fragment-based drug design platform (BMaps, www.boltzmannmaps.com), built under NIH Phase I and II grants, will be extended with fragment maps for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and further automation of compound enumeration through fragment growing. This will empower antiviral drug researchers in attacking the difficult problems of SARS-CoV-2 protease selectivity and inhibitor binding at allosteric or protein-protein interaction sites on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.",A Web Service for Fragment-based Selectivity Analysis of Drug Leads,10149527,R43GM133284,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allosteric Site', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Therapy', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Capsid', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Homology Modeling', 'Hot Spot', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Property', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccines', 'Viral', 'Water', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'human coronavirus', 'influenza M2', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'lead optimization', 'learning network', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'repository', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tool', 'web app', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,"CONIFER POINT PHARMACEUTICALS, LLC",R43,2020,225000,-0.0030354153309766377
"Algorithmic identification of binding specificity mechanisms in proteins Project Summary Variations in protein binding preferences are a critical barrier to the precision treatment of disease. When high resolution structures of a protein are available, and many isoforms of the protein have been connected to dif- fering binding preferences, it is possible in principle to model the structures of all isoforms and discover the mechanisms that cause variations in binding preferences.

"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,9952362,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47875,0.003892020641394502
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,0.09195841266913377
"A Technique for Measuring Transcription Factor Activity Summary  Almost every division of NIH has invested heavily in understanding transcription factors (TFs). TFs are the managers of the cell, controlling everything from cell type to cellular response to stress. With their great power, it is no wonder, many human disorders (cancer, familial platelet disorder, Waardenburg syndrome, etc.) result from mutations in transcription factors. Moreover, over 75% of disease causing variants within the human genome reside in regulatory regions, which are dense with TF binding sites. Currently we can measure the location of TF binding, but binding does not equate with regulatory activity. Furthermore, binding analysis is conducted one TF at a time. What is desperately needed is a technology that is able to measure the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. We have developed a novel approach, called eRNA proﬁling, that leverages enhancer RNAs to infer the activity of all TFs in a cell simultaneously. In this grant we seek to optimize our technology, making eRNA proﬁling more accurate, fast and broadly applicable. Narrative  Transcription factors are important in many human diseases.

"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,0.023748692697035213
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,9943364,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328440,0.03550762820988014
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,0.012365524791538775
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9983105,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,327738,0.09920752653016164
