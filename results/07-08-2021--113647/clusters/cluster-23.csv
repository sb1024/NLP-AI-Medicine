"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9838156,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,3521,127562714,0.2130114566151661
"The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on gut fungal commensal ecology, the mycobiome, in the neonatal period to advance mechanistic understanding of the gut-lung axis in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This research development plan is designed to provide the candidate, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and neonatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with the mentorship, training and research experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist in neonatal mucosal immunology. To achieve the candidate’s long-term goal of leading a productive translational research program focused on understanding mucosal immunology in BPD and facilitate his transition to independence, the candidate and his established mentors have devised a comprehensive development plan based on: 1) intensive, personal mentorship from a team with a proven history of productive mentoring; 2) in-depth experiential and focused didactic training to advance his understanding of molecular mycology, gnotobiotics and clinical research methods; and 3) an innovative research plan to produce causal evidence for gut mycobiome involvement in BPD development. The candidate’s research development plan outlines a focused path to obtain the knowledge, skills and experience required to accelerate his development into an independent clinician scientist who will have a lasting impact on neonatal mucosal immunology.  BPD is the most serious pulmonary complication of preterm birth. Treatments to modify developmental risk factors for BPD are lacking. Neonatal models of the gut-lung axis in other lung diseases, epidemiological studies linking antibiotic exposure with increased risk of BPD development, and the candidate’s extensive preliminary studies in mice and preterm newborns strongly suggest the gut mycobiome represents a therapeutic target to influence BPD development. This proposal builds on the candidate’s prior experience and the expertise of his mentors to explore the mechanisms of the neonatal gut-lung axis. We will test two hypotheses. 1) Prenatal antibiotic exposure-induced mycobiome changes drive increased BPD severity by disrupting the gut-lung axis. 2) Colonization with commensal fungi favorably alters the pulmonary mucosal immune response to hyperoxia. Determining if disruption of intestinal commensal microbial communities contributes to the development of lung injury in BPD will inform the development of therapeutics for mitigating BPD. These studies are expected to lay the groundwork translational studies in human preterm newborns. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a devastating chronic lung disease with debilitating long-term consequences, affects approximately half of all infants born extremely preterm. The objectives of this proposal are relevant to public health because they aim to establish that bacterial communities in the gut influence development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia by altering the immune responses of the developing lung. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insight into extra-pulmonary contributions to lung development and characterize new targets for therapy, which addresses goals of the NIH to seek mechanistic understanding of the microbiome in the pathobiology of lung diseases and reduce the incidence of chronic lung disease during early life.",The gut-lung axis influences the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia,9952647,K08HL151907,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alabama', 'Antibiotics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cell Wall', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Education', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lymphoid Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mucosal Immune Responses', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pediatrics', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'career development', 'critical developmental period', 'density', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fungus', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-lung axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'lung development', 'lung injury', 'member', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome components', 'microbiome composition', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'neonatal period', 'neonate', 'new therapeutic target', 'pneumonia model', 'pre-clinical', 'prenatal', 'preterm newborn', 'professor', 'protective effect', 'pulmonary function', 'research and development', 'respiratory microbiome', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'translational research program', 'translational study']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K08,2020,165456,325573502,0.08207009714296191
"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9970448,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,168019,230060143,0.23969067645285858
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with different imaging standards, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites.

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9830022,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,178349,533302350,0.19516884304877422
"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,9967745,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,243364,228951281,0.08395581097584202
"The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States. Currently, approximately 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer is very low, at only 16%. Investigators have been searching for effective screening modalities for the early detection of lung cancer so that patients can receive curative treatments at an early stage. When the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening (LCS), researchers and physicians hope to save lives from lung cancer by screening high-risk population who aged 55 to 77 years and have a 30 pack years making history or former smokes who have quitted within the past 15 years. Since the release of the landmark NLST results, many medical associations published guidelines to recommend LDCT-based screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also decided to cover the LCS for Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for lung cancer. While many efforts have been made to accelerate the dissemination the beneficial LCS, the concerns over the high false positive rates (96.4% of the positive results), invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications and health care costs may hinder the utilization of lung cancer screening. This concern was magnified as researchers and policy makers started questioning whether the complication rate and false positives in real-world settings would be even higher than the rates reported in the NLST, which was conducted in a setting with well-established facilities and proficiency in cancer care. Therefore, we propose to understand the contemporary use of lung cancer screening and associated health care outcomes and costs using data from a real-world setting. Our study has three goals: 1) to develop an innovative computable phenotype algorithm to identify high-risk and low-risk individuals for LCS from both structured and unstructured (i.e., clinical notes) electronic health record (EHR) data and to develop advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract LCS related clinical information from clinical notes such as radiology reports; 2) to determine the appropriate and inappropriate use of LDCT among high-risk and low-risk individuals in Florida and to examine the test results of LDCT, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and incidental findings in real-world settings; and 3) to develop and validate a microsimulation model of the clinical courses of LCS incorporating the real-world data in LCS to estimate the long-term benefits and the cost-effectiveness of LCS. Our proposed study has the potential to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality by informing policymakers and practitioners on the appropriateness of contemporary use of LCS. This knowledge will help both patients and physicians better understand the harm- benefit tradeoff of lung cancer screening and transform such knowledge into practice to prevent avoidable postprocedural complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening using Low-dose computed tomography is a promising technique to reduce the burden of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.

"Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of hospitalization in the US. Exacerbations - a worsening or “flare up” of symptoms - cause most COPD hospitalizations. Since most exacerbations can be treated with changes of inhalers and/or oral medications, at-home detection of lung function deterioration may facilitate earlier intervention and help delay or prevent hospitalizations. The Standards of Care for monitoring lung function are spirometry, plethysmography, and CT scan. However, these are expensive methods and unsuited for continuous monitoring or at-home use. Various patient self-monitoring approaches have been tried, for example, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate monitoring, and peak flow metering, but their efficacy in reducing hospitalizations has been limited.  A common finding for all forms of COPD is air trapping, defined, as an abnormal increase in the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation is complete. A body of evidence definitively shows that air trapping increases during exacerbations and decreases when exacerbations resolve. Recent reports show that air trapping is an earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes, and can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non- invasive tool when medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations.  Respira Labs has developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device that can continually monitor lung resonance: Sylvee. The device uses known acoustic-based technology with machine- learning algorithms to detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results suggest correspond to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this project is to validate Sylvee's air trapping algorithms in a cohort of 20 healthy controls and 40 COPD patients with and without air trapping, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will miniaturize and add sensors to the Sylvee device and develop a user interface (UI) and a mobile application. In Aims 3 and 4, we will create an Air Trapping Index Report and validate it in a cross-sectional study vis-à-vis whole body plethysmography as a control. Results of this project provide a go/no-go development decision based on device function. We can apply these results in STTR Phase II, in a larger clinical study to evaluate Sylvee as an at-home monitoring system, with a goal of reducing hospitalizations by at least 30%. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients' lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients' quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than 12 million Americans have been diagnosed with COPD, and another 17 million may have COPD, but are unaware of it. By 2020, the costs associated with COPD are estimated to be $72B billion per year, of which with ~50% are the costs of spent on ER visits and hospitalizations. The goal of this proposal is to establish and validate a seamless and non-obtrusive wearable that measures abnormal air trapping via a novel acoustic technology, which would reduce hospitalizations through at-home monitoring of lung function.","Clinical feasibility of a non-invasive, low-cost wearable for measuring air trapping in COPD",10080272,R41HL152769,"['Acoustics', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Bluetooth', 'Bronchoconstriction', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Edema', 'Emergency department visit', 'Exhalation', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Miniaturization', 'Minor', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Noise', 'Oral', 'Oxygen saturation measurement', 'Particulate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Refractory', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory Muscles', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Running', 'San Francisco', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Veterans', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'Wireless Technology', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'air monitoring', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'microphone', 'miniaturize', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'novel', 'ozone exposure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"RESPIRA LABS, LLC",R41,2020,350000,350000,0.08390291764407565
"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients. The outcomes of this proposal can assist healthcare providers to identify the most effective strategy for NSCLC treatment, improve public health, and promote precision medicine.",Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management,10023259,R01CA249758,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Status', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Pathology', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically actionable', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'men', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,375150,90710179,0.07064439724697899
"Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously impacted society, communities, and the healthcare system across the world, and threatens to continue to challenge society for the coming months and years. More than 1 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and more than 60,000 Americans have lost their lives as of the writing of this proposal. The ultimate goal of this research is to create a wearable physiological sensing solution for COVID-19 patient management, including diagnosis, triage, and monitoring of patients based on lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measures captured with the same device. The central innovation lies in the hardware and algorithms that have been proposed for this purpose, building upon the team’s prior work in other areas of wearable bio-acoustic sensing and bioimpedance spectroscopy. The following two specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to design, implement, and validate a wearable sensing system for lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and inertial measurements; and (2) to test and evaluate this system to assess efficacy and potential information derived in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and persons under investigation for COVID-19 longitudinally. Successful completion of this project would result in a validated prototype for sensing multiple parameters of cardiopulmonary health in patients with COVID-19, with imminent feasibility to transition the technology to commercialization and through regulatory pathways. This would provide a much-needed patient management technology for this novel coronavirus to healthcare practitioners and ultimately a means to monitor patients remotely to ensure that any deterioration in health is detected as early as possible. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the US and the rest of the world in an unparalleled manner, taking nearly 60,000 lives in the US alone over the past two months and afflicting more than a million Americans, with costs to society that are difficult to measure or bear. Technologies for improving the management of patients presenting at the emergency room are urgently needed in this era, specifically for determining whether such patients should be cared for in the intensive care unit, via infectious diseases procedures, or otherwise. We propose to design a wearable system for measuring lung sounds, lung fluid, body temperature, and movement in the same device to address these critical needs.","Wearable lung sounds, fluid, and body temperature monitoring for patients with COVID-19",10163297,R01EB023808,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Body Temperature', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Childhood Arthritis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Community Healthcare', 'Data Analytics', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Injuries', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Respiratory distress', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Temperature', 'Societies', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stethoscopes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'healthy volunteer', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'synergism', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,396542,45341731,0.10158159640788714
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules.

"PRISTINE: Pre-cancer histology identification of Endobronchial biopsies using deep learning PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. In order to increase survival, therapies are urgently needed to intercept the cancer development process and decrease the rate of patients presenting with advanced disease. A potential promising point of interception is to develop therapies to reverse or delay the development of lung premalignant lesions (PMLs). About 20% of lung cancers arise in the epithelial layer of the bronchial airways and these are preceded by the development of PMLs that are important clinical indicators of lung cancer risk in the airways or at remote parenchymal sites. As part of the NCI-Moonshot our group is engaged in creating a multi-omic lung Pre-Cancer Atlas (PCA). The success of this project in creating clinically relevant biomarkers and therapeutics depends on accurate assessments of histology and immune infiltrates in PMLs. Currently, however, pathologic assessment of the morphological stages of increasing abnormality from hyperplasia, metaplasia, dysplasia (mild, moderate, and severe), to invasive carcinoma is challenging and not routine. The objective of the proposed study is to develop and disseminate a computationally efficient deep learning framework to annotate a variety of histologic features in PMLs from the Lung PCA and associate these features with clinical and genomic data. Our central hypothesis is that deep learning can be applied to digitized H&E whole slide images (WSIs) of bronchial PMLs to identify a comprehensive set of histologic features and metrics summarizing their spatial organization that may enhance biomarkers of PML progression to cancer. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. First, we will annotate PMLs and develop a semantic segmentation framework using deep learning to predict histologic features of PMLs. Second, we will disseminate our deep learning framework and show its utility in enhancing PML-associated biomarkers. The proposed study is significant because the framework we develop can be applied to predict other features in the WSIs from PMLs and be modified to encompass other PMLs of the lung (e.g. those associated with lung adenocarcinoma) as well as other premalignant lesions found in other epithelial tissue types such as breast, colon, prostate, etc. Currently, deep learning approaches have not been applied to PMLs, and this proposal is innovative in the unique clinical specimens that it leverages with corresponding genomic and clinical data and in its development of a patch- based convolutional neural network to predict histologic features of PMLs. Our long-term goal is to develop a deep learning framework to predict a variety of features from lung PML WSIs and integrate these with genomic data on these same samples to discover robust biomarkers of PML progression and therapeutics to prevent invasive cancer development. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study aims to develop and disseminate a computationally efficient deep learning framework to annotate histologic features in lung squamous premalignant lesions using digitized H&E whole slide images and associate these features with clinical and genomic data. We also aim to demonstrate the utility of our method in providing image-based features to enhance our genomic biomarkers of premalignant lesion progression.

"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer.

"Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules ABSTRACT (PROJECT DESCRIPTION) The rollout of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening programs is accelerating in the United States, aiming for earlier detection of lung cancer to improve long-term survival. However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance. This project develops new predictive models for the management of IPNs using clinical and imaging information ac- crued over time, providing individually-tailored clinical decision support.",Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules,9829087,R01CA226079,"['Address', 'Belief', 'Benign', 'Cancerous', 'Capital', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Leadership', 'Life Expectancy', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision support', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'database structure', 'design', 'discrete time', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening policy', 'screening program', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool', 'web based interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,456756,673201228,0.1481508491674359
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9934164,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effectiveness validation', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,461573,641965656,0.28269493844226584
"Radiologist-Centered Artificial Intelligence (RCAI) for Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality. However, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign). Artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have helped radiologists to reduce the missed-tumor rates moderately, but have not been widely adopted for three key reasons: lack of efficiency, lack of real-time collaboration, and lack of interpretability. The overall goal of this proposal is to create radiologist-centered artificial intelligence algorithms that are both interpretable and collaborative and to demonstrate their improved efficacy via lung cancer screening experiments. The central hypothesis of this effort is that the creation of an AI based virtual cognitive assistant (VCA) will provide a better understanding of cognitive biases while offering interpretable feedback to radiologists for an improved screening experience with higher diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency.  Specific aims of the proposal are three-fold. Aim 1: To develop an eye-tracking platform that offers a realistic radiology reading room experience while extracting gaze patterns from radiologists. This will facilitate addressing the problem of true collaboration between radiologists and CAD. Radiologists will perform their screening without any constraints (e.g., wearing glasses) while their gaze patterns and other human-computer interaction events are tracked, processed, and stored in real time. Aim 2: To develop an automated real-time collaborative system involving a developed VCA and the radiologist to synergistically improve detection and diagnostic performances. Using deep learning (DL) algorithms, the VCA will embody a powerful visual attention model to represent radiologists’ gaze, visual search, and fixation patterns, and will be composed of a detection component and a diagnostic component. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm will enable communication between the VCA and the radiologist. Lastly, a DL-based segmentation component will, on the fly, enable the VCA to derive and visualize quantitative measures (HU statistics, volume, long/short axes lengths, etc.) and overlay them along with the tumor classification label (benign/malignant) and its probability in real time. Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed VCA via lung cancer screening experiments involving six radiologists from two institutes (University of Pennsylvania and NIH) at different expertise levels.  The proposed VCA is a first-of-a-kind-system to exploit the synergy between powerful DL technology and experts (humans) to attempt boost clinical diagnostic performance of radiologists, unlike passive DL techniques that learn from labeled data. The outcome of this research are expected to be transformative by providing deep insights for re-designing current CAD systems to truly collaborate with radiologists, instead of acting as second opinion tools for them or replacing them, and by ultimately further reducing lung cancer-related deaths. NARRATIVE Although artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis systems have been shown to be useful in lung cancer screening and diagnosis, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign). The goal of this proposal is to create novel AI algorithms, called radiologist-centered AI, which tightly integrate in real time the radiologist's reading pattern and AI via an eye-tracking device and to demonstrate their improved efficacy via lung cancer screening experiments using low-dose CT scans. The outcome of this research will be a virtual cognitive assistant (VCA) for radiologists, truly actively collaborating with them instead of passively acting as second opinion tools or replacing them, and ultimately further reducing lung cancer-related deaths.",Radiologist-Centered Artificial Intelligence (RCAI) for Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis,9971649,R01CA240639,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung nodule', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Opinions', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual attention', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'learning network', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'statistics', 'synergism', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual', 'visual search', 'visual tracking']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R01,2020,576431,16827427,0.12653670799974806
"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it has the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. Findings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9981789,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'bronchial epithelium', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'random forest', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2020,589485,6013508,0.11936984343231125
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes.

"Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging The molecular epidemiology of lung cancer in Africa is almost completely unknown, yet molecular profiling and institution of targeted therapy is now standardly used to influence care in patients with actionable mutations. HIV- infection is associated with a markedly increased risk of lung cancer, but its association with lung cancer and how it influences disease outcomes is not well studied. The capacity to correctly diagnose lung cancer on radiological images, tissue specimen acquisition, and subsequent histologic confirmation compounds the problem of under and misdiagnosis of lung cancer in Africa, especially with the prevalence and often presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. In this consortium proposal, we therefore seek to address the above stated problems by 1) establishing national lung cancer diagnostic referral networks in Uganda and Tanzania, which will allow for improved detection of lung cancer and, hence decrease the lung cancer burden; 2) investigating the role of HIV-1 infection on the incidence and outcomes of lung cancer in the region; 3) determining the molecular profile of lung cancer in East African countries in order to facilitate advocacy for scale- up of targeted therapies (including immune-based therapies); 4) building capacity for lung cancer diagnosis and care in terms of improving imaging, pathology, radiology and tissue acquisition and clinical care of lung cancer 5) creating a lung cancer research collaboration that will build capacity through mentoring of junior researchers for future leadership in the field. At the end of this project, we envision an African-led lung cancer research network, clinical expertise for sample acquisition and care, improved pathology and radiology diagnostics services, a lung cancer screening program, and a large biorepository that should support lung cancer research in the region for many years to come. We propose to study lung cancer in Uganda and Tanzania and the relationship to HIV-1 infection through three project-based and three cores. The results of these studies of the epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging of lung cancer and the relationship to HIV infection will lead to technological transfer of instrumentation to characterize lung cancer and artificial intelligence algorithms to aid in discerning pulmonary granulomatous disease from lung cancer on radiological imaging. Findings herein may lead to the development of country-specific guidelines in the evaluation and management of lung cancer.","Lung cancer in East Africa and the relationship to HIV-1 infection: epidemiology, molecular characterization and imaging",10084623,U54CA254566,"['Address', 'Advocacy', 'Africa', 'African', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Granulomatous', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV-1', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lung', 'Lung Capacity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Tanzania', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Uganda', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'lung cancer screening', 'lung imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'scale up', 'screening program', 'targeted treatment']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,1024684,197030888,0.215827464240415
"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9805358,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'oncology', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,201623,230060143,0.23969067645285858
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with different imaging standards, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites.

"Deep Radiomic Analysis of Coronary Heart Disease with Lung Screening CT Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) caused 17.7 million deaths in 2015, accounting for one third of all deaths globally. Amongst 8.8 million cancer-deaths in 2015, lung cancer contributed to 1.69 million deaths worldwide. In the United States, lung cancer will claim 154,050 lives in 2018, representing a quarter of all cancer deaths. Both CVDs and lung cancer share several risk factors, including unhealthy dietary patterns, obesity, and tobacco use. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT), an effective lung cancer screening technique, reduces the cancer-related mortality rate by 20% in those with history of heavy smoking. Such subjects have substantially higher risk of CVDs than lung cancer. Indeed, most subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs. Concomitant CVD screening will have profound benefits for these subjects at no additional time, cost, or radiation dose to the patient. The goal of the project is to develop an automated workflow of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk (CARMOR) evaluation with lung cancer screening LDCT data to provide high-risk subjects a “radiation-free” CVD screening without cost or time constraints. Our central hypothesis is that deep radiomics from LDCT follow-up scans and across different reconstructions can effectively improve the performance of CARMOR estimation. To validate our hypothesis, we will perform radiomics analysis on CARMOR with lung cancer screening LDCT scans, and then further enhance the CARMOR features with complementary image reconstructions from the same scan and serial LDCT scans for optimized prognostic performance. The CARMOR quantification methods in lung screening LDCT will be validated retrospectively against multiple subspecialty radiologists with Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CCTA) as the standard of reference. The project requires us to perform analyses over serial LDCT exams and different reconstruction techniques and settings. Therefore, major innovations and improvements need to be made for this challenging deep radiomic analysis task. Since the risk factors of CVDs and lung cancer are closely related with lifestyle, the findings of the project can also be used to create teachable moments for patients to change towards healthier lifestyles. In context of the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement of LDCT for lung cancer screening and stress on the importance of considering co-morbidities, our timely project will have a significant impact on the healthcare of a large population. At the end of the project, we will have developed an automated workflow of assessing CARMOR for lung screening LDCT with zero radiation added. We will also have acquired study results to enable personalized patient education to address the long-term health crisis caused by unhealthy lifestyles. Our studies will lead to new understanding of deep radiomics in CVD screening and the impact of LDCT reconstructions in clinical practice. Low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is effective in lung cancer screening and can reduce the mortality rate by 20% for the high-risk population. However, heavy smokers are affected by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) even more than by lung cancer and most high-risk subjects undergoing lung cancer screening with LDCT have an intermediate to high risk for CVDs.

"Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the second-most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in men and women. Among the different types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type and it constitutes 85% to 90% of all lung cancer cases. Current cancer research has shown that multiple somatic mutations affect the sensitivity of patients to various drugs used for NSCLC treatment. These mutations are essential factors for determining the most effective, “personalized” treatment for each NSCLC patient; however, most NSCLC patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies in their first year of treatment. Many mechanisms of this resistance are still unknown. Designing and prescribing better targeted therapies for NSCLC patients requires further understanding, particularly with respect to the relationship between NSCLC tumors’ pathological and clinical findings, genetic profiles, and targeted therapy responses/resistance. Currently, there is no computational method to connect observations and findings from pathology reports, medical records, somatic mutations, and the targeted therapy resistance. This project provides a plan to build a novel computational method to identify statistically significant associations between the pathological findings of NSCLC tumors and the presence of clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Furthermore, these associations, in combination with an innovative set of feature analysis from pathology reports and electronic medical records, will be leveraged to build and validate a machine-learning model to identify NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable somatic mutations. Finally, the associated clinical, pathological, and genetic findings for NSCLC patients will be used in a new machine-learning framework to predict patients’ time-to-resistance to targeted therapies. The required data to build and validate the proposed models in this project will be obtained through a collaboration with the Department of Pathology’s Laboratory for Clinical Genomics and Advanced Technologies at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. In addition to internal validation, the investigators in this proposal established a collaboration with the Department of Pathology at the University of Vermont Medical Center to apply and validate the developed models on an external data source. Upon successful implementation of this bioinformatics approach, the developed models will be able to reveal statistically significant links between clinical and pathological findings, clinically-actionable somatic mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for a better understanding of NSCLC tumor development and treatment. The proposed approach will provide an accurate, fast, and inexpensive pre- selection method for screening NSCLC patients with clinically-actionable mutations for translational research and precision medicine. Furthermore, the proposed machine-learning method to identify NSCLC patients’ resistance to targeted therapies will help healthcare providers to select the best treatment strategies for these patients, improve their health outcomes, and establish this precision medicine paradigm for other types of cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Resistance to targeted therapies severely limits the ability to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. This project proposes a novel computational approach to find statistically-significant links between pathological and clinical findings, clinically-actionable mutations, and targeted-therapy responses for NSCLC patients. The outcomes of this proposal can assist healthcare providers to identify the most effective strategy for NSCLC treatment, improve public health, and promote precision medicine.",Clinicopathologic and Genetic Profiling through Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for Precision Lung Cancer Management,9726144,R01CA249758,"['Affect', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Semantics', 'Smoking Status', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Pathology', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically actionable', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'men', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,375150,90710179,0.07064439724697899
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9693200,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,440946,641965656,0.28269493844226584
"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system.

However, a consequence of such imaging programs is the increased discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). Significant ques- tions remain around the effective management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs: while many are benign, a fraction will go on to become cancerous. Diagnostic models for IPNs and associated management guidelines have been described previously, but their real-world validation is limited. Moreover, the majority of models only use a “snapshot” of the IPN at a single point in time and fail to take into consideration progressive changes. Opportunities now exist to advance such predictive models by encompassing the patient's evolving medical history, combining clinical and imaging biomarkers to improve prediction and individually-tailor the management of IPNs over time. The objective of this imaging informatics proposal is the development of a clinical decision support tool for the management of screen- and incidentally-detected IPNs. We address two key challenges: 1) the development of a continuous-time model for predicting how the IPN will evolve; and 2) the use of this prediction to determine a series of actions over time that will optimize (screening) outcomes for the individual. We first explore the devel- opment of a continuous time belief network (CTBN), a temporal probabilistic model to predict the likelihood of a patient to develop lung cancer. Unlike traditional approaches, CTBNs do not require fixed sampling frequency of the data over time (e.g., all observations made annually) and are thus more amenable to real-world clinical settings and observational datasets. The probabilities computed through the CTBN are subsequently input into a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to guide IPN management decisions. From the POMDP, policies (sequences of actions over time) can be chosen to achieve a desired goal (e.g., minimizing time to diagnosis), given past and current observations/decisions for an individual. For both the CTBN and POMDP, we explore novel methods in the design and implementation, overcoming computational challenges to realize translation of these models into practice. A web-based interface is implemented, providing a clinical de- cision making tool for physicians to understand the models' recommendations. Evaluation focuses on assessing the performance of the CTBN and POMDP relative to known outcomes and compared to other conventional methods (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, dynamic belief networks); as well as the overall impact of the system to influence decision-making. This effort advances our past research in probabilistic models and capital- izes on expertise in lung cancer screening, including past leadership of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The result of this effort will be a set of informatics-driven modeling tools and new temporal predictive models informing IPN management. PROGRAM NARRATIVE Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung screening is being implemented nationwide, aiming to reduce mortality due to lung cancer. But questions have been raised regarding false positives, with concerns about the attendant discovery of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) and their ensuing long-term surveillance. This project develops new predictive models for the management of IPNs using clinical and imaging information ac- crued over time, providing individually-tailored clinical decision support.",Individually-tailored clinical decision support for management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules,9668004,R01CA226079,"['Address', 'Belief', 'Benign', 'Cancerous', 'Capital', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Leadership', 'Life Expectancy', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical History', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision support', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'database structure', 'design', 'discrete time', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging program', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening policy', 'screening program', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool', 'web based interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,464766,673201228,0.1481508491674359
"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9626360,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,495096,127562714,0.2130114566151661
"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9617686,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adherence rate', 'base', 'care costs', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'risk prediction model', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,507649,533302350,0.19516884304877422
"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it has the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. Findings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9762965,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'random forest', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2019,614648,6013508,0.11936984343231125
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9740637,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Translating', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'c new', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,790346,558628098,0.06268109627824406
"A Systems Biology Approach to Mapping Aging in the lung PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for an NRSA Individual Fellowship is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to provide a rich environment for learning and growth to support the candidate's development into an effective physician- scientist, and 2) to generate a molecular map of aging in the lung by applying a systems biology approach to the analysis of transcriptomic data obtained over the lifespan of the laboratory mouse. The candidate and his mentors have designed a specific training plan that includes a rigorous research component and lays the foundation for a successful career. Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, however, the biological mechanisms contributing to this are not understood. The candidate will employ a systems biology approach to analyze already generated datasets to identify molecular pathways of aging in the lung. A better understanding of aging in the lung may ultimately lead to the development of novel therapies for lung diseases in older adults. Gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq has been used to generate “maps” of tissues by depicting tissues and purified constituent cellular populations on a molecular level. Transcriptional profiles from individuals with disease have been compared to those from healthy individuals in an attempt to develop “signatures” for a given disease. These signatures can be useful for disease diagnosis as well as for identifying targets for therapy. This proposal focuses on the contributions of two abundant cell populations in the lung, alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells (AT2), to the transcriptional signatures of aging in the lung. The candidate has preliminary data demonstrating evidence of an aging signature in alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells purified from mice at 18 months compared with 3 months. This signature persists during an influenza A virus infection challenge. The purpose of this proposal is to employ a systems biology approach to analyze transcriptomic data already obtained by investigators in the candidate's laboratory that includes whole lung tissue, alveolar macrophages, and AT2 cells harvested from mice over the lifespan (2 weeks, and 6,12,18 and 24 months of age). In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will generate a transcriptional map of aging in murine whole lung and purified cellular populations of alveolar macrophages and AT2 cells. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will determine whether the transcriptional signature of aging in alveolar macrophages is cell autonomous or is driven by changes in the alveolar local microenvironment. Over the course of this award, the candidate will learn new systems biology approaches to analyzing large time-series genomic datasets and will develop a comprehensive understanding of the age-related changes in the innate immune system of the lung. The skills developed as part of this project will serve as a guide for the analysis of similar genomic data harvested from aging humans with lung disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aging is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality related to diseases that affect the lung, including lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung fibrosis, and lung infections. The mechanisms contributing to the increased susceptibility of older adults to these diseases are unknown.

"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules. The advanced ultrasound methods to be evaluated in this proposal seek to drastically reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries of benign thyroid nodules.",Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound,9405532,R21CA212744,"['Achievement', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Elasticity', 'Endocrine', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'base', 'calcification', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lymph nodes', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'statistics']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,190102,61416950,0.08652657036208246
"Lung Navigation System for Localizing and Resecting Nodules Project Abstract  Although Wedge Resection Surgery results in better lung function, tumor recurrence rate is almost double that of lobectomy, with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates. This may be attributed to the difficulty in accurately localizing and resecting the nodules in a deflated lung. Currently, there is no effective method of accurately localizing the nodules and guiding the surgical stapling device to the optimal resection margin. The long-term goal of this research is to investigate algorithms and technologies to manage lung nodules from diagnosis to surgical resection. The objective of this proposal is to design and develop a lung navigation (LungNav) system to localize and excise, with sufficient margin, small and early malignant lung nodules. The experimental methods will be to design and develop the LungNav system integrated with an active nodule tracker called J-bar, machine learning algorithms for determining the optimal resection margin, and tracked surgical stapling device for accurately excising the nodule. Tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality displays will be developed to visualize the nodule on thoracosopy videos and guide the surgical stapler in real-time to the optimal margin. The hypothesis is that by anchoring the J-bar close to the nodule, the nodule position can be accurately tracked in real-time despite significant tissue deformation when the lung is collapsed and manipulated during surgery. To achieve the goals of this project, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design and develop the nodule tracker (J-bar) and deformation algorithms to estimate the real-time position of the nodule. 2) Investigate a machine-learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine the optimal resection margin. 3) Design and develop a software navigation module, called LungNav, for visualizing the tumor and navigating the surgical stapler to the optimal resection margin. 4) Validate the design and performance of the LungNav system using ex-vivo lung tissue and live porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it addresses an important problem, which potentially affects several thousand patients each year, of accurately localizing and resecting lung nodules while preserving healthy lung function. The research is innovative since it builds on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, navigation systems and augmented reality methods to accurately diagnose and localize the nodule in presence of significant tissue deformation. The expected outcome of the project is the development of CNN-based machine learning algorithms for lung nodule classification and a LungNav system with tumor deformation algorithms and augmented reality methods to localize and guide complete surgical resection of lung nodules.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9526145,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,480528,641965656,0.28269493844226584
"Lung Cancer Screening via Ultrasensitive and Cost-efficient Analysis of Tumor DNA Signatures in Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Substantial improvements in cancer survival rates could be achieved by developing better tools to detect occult malignancies at an earlier, more curable stage. Unfortunately, efforts to identify serum protein biomarkers that are sufficiently cancer-specific to be used for screening have found little success. Here, we pursue an alternative strategy based on detection of exceptionally tumor-specific mutant DNA fragments in the circulation of patients with early-stage lung cancer. Because these tumor-derived DNA fragments harbor genetic signatures that would be uncommon in healthy individuals, they hold great promise for screening applications where a high frequency of false-positive results would be unacceptable. However, it is a formidable challenge to create an assay that is able to detect trace quantities of mutant DNA released into the bloodstream from a small, early-stage tumor, without knowing the tumor’s mutation profile beforehand. Additional challenges are posed by economic factors as well as the presence of low-level mutations in the healthy population. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with highly complementary expertise from Microsoft Research and from Yale, Rice, and Harvard Universities. In this proposal, we describe innovative solutions in which we apply tools of biochemistry, thermodynamics, machine learning, and biostatistics to develop and validate an ultrasensitive, cost-efficient assay for detecting rare mutant DNA fragments in blood as markers of early-stage lung cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer has a high fatality rate because most patients are diagnosed at a late stage, when the disease is more difficult to cure.

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system. Project Narrative: The project aims to develop an online computer tool to aid in efficacious early  lung cancer screening and diagnosis based on LDCT.

"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,9446631,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Smoker', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,532539,127562714,0.2130114566151661
"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up).

Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it ha s the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers.

"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9356362,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modernization', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Site', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'rural area', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2017,164421,113554200,0.05121499854844382
"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules. The advanced ultrasound methods to be evaluated in this proposal seek to drastically reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries of benign thyroid nodules.",Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound,9224641,R21CA212744,"['Achievement', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Calcified', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Elasticity', 'Endocrine', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'base', 'calcification', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lymph nodes', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'statistics']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2017,274504,61416950,0.08652657036208246
"Lung Cancer Screening: Identifying Factors Associated With Participation Abstract Lung cancer screening is a recent recommendation and new screening programs are currently being implemented. However, we do not yet know what factors influence screening-eligible smokers to screen. Smokers are a unique population and psychological variables (stigma, medical mistrust, cancer fatalism, worry, and fear) may be important and have very different relationships in lung cancer screening participation than participation in other types of cancer screening. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to develop an explanatory framework for lung cancer screening participation from the perspective of the individual to inform future patient-level tailored interventions through testing a model of factors related to screening. Specific aims include: 1) test the relationships among variables depicted in the conceptual model for lung cancer screening participation using structural equation modeling including mediation effects in a sample of screening-eligible long-term current and former smokers; 2) provide robust descriptions of factors that influence lung cancer screening and elucidate the relationships among the factors based on in-depth narratives of screening-eligible smokers; and 3) integrate findings drawn from both survey and narrative data to inform patient-level tailored intervention development. Study design: Sequential explanatory mixed methods design using survey methods and individual interviews. Measures: Quantitative self-reported data will be collected via a web-based survey comprised of the following elements: Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Smoking Subscale, Patient Trust in the Medical Profession Scale, Revised Powe Fatalism Scale, Lung Cancer Worry Scale, Lung Cancer Fear Scale, Demographic and Health Status Characteristics Questionnaire (including healthcare provider recommendation, media exposure, and lung cancer screening participation), Knowledge: Lung Cancer and Lung Cancer Screening Scale, Social Influence Scale, and Lung Cancer Screening Health Beliefs Scales. Qualitative data will be collected via audio- taped individual in-depth interviews. Data analysis: Quantitative data will be analyzed using bivariate analyses between variables in the conceptual model including t-tests, analysis of variance, linear regression, and logistic regression. The entire conceptual model will then be analyzed using path analysis via structural equation modeling. Content analysis and a series of data display tables will be used to analyze data from the in-depth interviews. The integration of qualitative and quantatitive will occur at two time points: (1) quantitative data will be used to develop individual participant profiles in order to selectively sample participants and design interview guides for the in-depth interviews; and (2) the quantitative and qualitative findings will be integrated at the stage of data interpretation. By augmenting quantitative findings with qualitative data, we will generate new knowledge to inform future tailored interventions. NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography is a recent recommendation for long-term current and former smokers and has the potential to identify lung cancer at an earlier, more treatable stage. Understanding factors that are associated with the decision to screen, or not, from the perspective of the individual making the decision is critical knowledge needed to develop important shared decision-making processes that are key between healthcare providers and their high-risk patients. By understanding lung cancer screening participation more fully from the perspective of the individual, improved health outcomes can be addressed in high-risk smokers.",Lung Cancer Screening: Identifying Factors Associated With Participation,9302070,R15CA208543,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Equation', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Secondary to', 'Series', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Trust', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cancer type', 'design', 'experience', 'health belief', 'high risk', 'improved', 'killings', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'social', 'social stigma', 'therapy development']",NCI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R15,2017,458334,232986943,0.17909805062707773
"The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. NARRATIVE This investigation will ultimately lead to better care and outcomes for over 1.5 million people per year with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The study compares the effectiveness (early-detection of lung cancer), safety (radiation exposure, procedure related adverse-events), and costs of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. a guideline-concordant, more intense, or less intense work-up). Knowledge gained from this investigation will direct limited resources towards development of system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence (e.g. standardized radiology reports, centralized nodule care) or investigating alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk-prediction, biomarkers).","The Effectiveness, Safety, and Costs of Guideline-Concordant Lung Nodule Care",9258221,R01CA207375,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'American', 'Back', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Uncontrolled Study', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'care delivery', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'evidence base', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'routine provider', 'success', 'therapy design']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,609467,533302350,0.19516884304877422

"Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer, one of the major tasks is to provide the dynamic images and tumor shapes that reflect the patient's real-time anatomy as the roadmap for guiding the delivery of radiation beams. One fundamental question for these applications is how to estimate such dynamic images, as well location and shape changes of tumor using available sensors to capture the respiratory motion. This proposal focuses on solving such a lung motion tracking problem by using our newly proposed high- dimensional surface to lung motion prediction model and considering the difference of each individuals, such as gender, size, and respiratory pattern. Specifically, we wil optimize the statistical models that capture the motion distribution from training samples and the nonlinear prediction model for accurate lung motion tracking and conduct extensive evaluation for the lung motion tracking system developed to validate its feasibility in clinic practice. Our goal is to develop an efficient, effective and robust lung motion tracking system for dynamic image guidance of the radiotherapy procedures. After this clinical data validation, such a technique can also be applied to image-guided intervention.

"Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary disease (including primarily asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), pneumonia, lung cancer, and tuberculosis) is an increasingly large portion of the global health burden. Developing countries with large low-income populations are disproportionately affected, due to increased risk factors (e.g. biomass cooking stoves) as well as poor access to health care and lack of affordable screening tools for early detection. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) alone is currently the third leading cause of death in the world and second leading cause of death in India after ischemic heart disease. In the younger population, pneumonia is a particular concern, being the leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age. Tuberculosis (TB) has also reached alarming proportions in India (24% of all cases worldwide). Despite this great prevalence of pulmonary disease in India, access to modern diagnostics instruments is not possible; furthermore, approximately 60% of general practice (GP) clinic doctors in India are primarily trained in Ayurvedic medicine with little or no training for diagnosing respiratory disease. As a result, many of the patients with lung disease are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed (often confused with cardiovascular disease). As a result, there is a great need to provide health workers in India with simple tools that can be used to diagnose or screen for respiratory disease in the primary care setting. Addressing this need, our team has been developing a mobile diagnostic platform consisting of a digital stethoscope, peak flow meter, and mobile phone that can be used to screen for symptoms of lung disease and provide a guide for diagnosis. The present study extends this work and has the following aims: (1) To validate and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform for the purpose of identifying symptoms of lung disease and providing diagnostic guidance. (2) To assess the acceptance and usability of the mobile diagnostic platform by the local general practitioner (GP) doctors in rural India. We propose to deploy and test a low-cost mobile diagnostic platform, making use of machine learning algorithms that will detect specific symptoms of lung disease and help guide diagnosis. In the first year of the project, we shall create and train the mobile software algorithm using data collected in the field from patients (N=250) that have been previously diagnosed with specific lung diseases. Then year 2, we shall evaluate and test our mobile platform with Indian patients (N=250) recruited from four GP clinic sites in the Pune, India region. The automated mobile phone diagnosis result shall then be compared with the diagnosis from trained pulmonologists, using a traditional stethoscope as well as standard lung function testing instruments. A preliminary diagnosis and qualitative feedback shall also be collected from non-trained GP doctors using the mobile tools in order to ascertain usability and diagnostic value.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pulmonary disease is a very large public health concern in India, as well as in most developing countries. Relatively few general practitioner (GP) doctors are trained to properly diagnose pulmonary disease, and affordable tools for diagnostic support simply do not exist. This proposal seeks to validate and test the use of low-cost mobile phone-based diagnostic tools for pulmonary disease.            ",Low Cost Mobile Platform for Pulmonary Disease Screening,9018346,R21TW010245,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Ayurvedic Medicine', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biomass', 'Bronchitis', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Cookstove', 'Data', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Feedback', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Health', 'Household Air Pollution', 'India', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Low Income Population', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'cost', 'digital', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'primary care setting', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'tool', 'usability']",FIC,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2016,181365,113554200,0.05121499854844382
"Tensor-based Dictionary Learning for Imaging Biomarkers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a central concept in systems biomedicine, biomarkers are multi-scale, diverse, and inter-connected indicators of physiological and pathological states and activities. Over the past decade, the research in this area has been active and exciting, including imaging informatics based on imaging biomarkers. In this context, the genome-wide association studies are being performed to establish fundamental links between genotypic and phenotypic biomarkers but a prime challenge is that progress along this direction has been far from what was widely expected. A critical observation is that while data are exploding from genome sequencing and epigenetic analysis, in most cases medical image features are still subjective or only defined in classic fashions, which seems an unreasonable imbalance between genotypic and phenotypic worlds. Lung cancer screening is an emerging CT application and an opportunity to identify imaging biomarkers. Like other cancers, lung cancer is not one but many diseases. It is different in each patient and even in each tumor site with overwhelming nonlinearity and dynamics.

"Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are developing the Indicator Cell Assay Platform (iCAP), a broadly applicable and inexpensive blood- based assay that can be used for early detection of disease, disease stage stratification, prognosis and response to therapeutic intervention for a variety of diseases. The iCAP uses cultured cells as biosensors, capitalizing on the ability of cells to respond differently to signals present in the serum (or other biofluid) from normal or diseased subjects with exquisite sensitivity, as opposed to traditional assays that rely on direct detection of molecules in blood. Developing the iCAP involves exposing cultured cells to serum from normal or diseased subjects, measuring a global differential response pattern, and using it to build a reliable disease classifier comprised of a small number of features. Deploying the iCAP involves measuring only expression genes that are features of the disease classifier using cost-effective tools. Indicator cells are chosen based on the disease application, and those typically selected have known relationships to the disease pathology. The iCAP can overcome barriers to blood-based diagnostics like broad dynamic range of blood components, low abundance of specific markers, and high levels of noise. The focus of this proposal is to initiate development of the iCAP for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer (LC). Blood biomarkers of LC are desperately needed for use in combination with existing imaging tools to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our long-term goal is to develop a blood-based assay for clinical use on patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to distinguish those with LC from those with benign nodules. This assay will help patients with benign nodules avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic tests on those with LC. For this Phase I study, we propose to develop an assay to reliably distinguish LC from benign nodules from patient serum samples. Specifically, we aim to 1) identify optimal indicator cells for the assay, 2) develop an iCAP-based classifier to reliably distinguish patients with lung cancer from those with benign nodules using patient serum, and 3) validate the assay by analyzing new serum samples. If we successfully achieve robust classification with >90% blind predictive accuracy and 70% sensitivity and specificity, the assay will be optimized and validated with larger cohorts in a Phase II study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are developing a novel blood-based diagnostic tool called the indicator cell assay platform (iCAP) that uses cultured cells as biosensors to detect disease status of patients from blood samples. The iCAP will succeed where other methods have failed by exploiting cells' natural capability to amplify and integrate disease signals in blood. Here we will initiate development of an assay to robustly identify lung cancer in patients that have indeterminate pulmonary nodules identified by imaging to avoid invasive biopsy and focus further diagnostic test on those with lung cancer.            ",Development of an Indicator Cell Assay for blood-based diagnosis of lung cancer,9048593,R43CA203455,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biosensor', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Lipids', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nodule', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'blind', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCI,"PRECYTE, INC.",R43,2016,299947,998853,0.11090285710643538
"Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal exposure to gestational smoking and use of vitamins during pregnancy can predict deficits in lung function, which is a feature of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recent studies suggest that the fetus adapts to prenatal conditions by changing its epigenetic make-up thus linking the prenatal conditions to lung function and adverse pulmonary outcomes later in life. The addition of methyl groups at cytosine- phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) is one such epigenetic mechanism which is influenced by prenatal conditions. However, it is not known yet which specific CpGs are associated with lung function. It is also unknown which metabolites, nutrients, and toxins (MNTs) during gestation influence the methylation of specific CpGs, which in turn predict lung function. To improve our mechanistic understanding the proposed pathways will be investigated in three aims. The study uses two consecutive birth cohorts (F0 grandparents, F1 parents, and F2 children), established on the Isle of Wight, UK. In Aim 1, using the statistical methods of recursive Random Forest, we will identify differently methylated CpGs that are related to a deficit in lung function in the F1 generation. The findings will be replicated in an independent sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. Aim 2 will utilize liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to conduct an un-targeted chemical screening of unknown MNTs in maternal serum collected at birth of the F1 and F2 generations. This will be followed by a statistical screening via recursive Random Forest for MNTs significantly related to the differently methylated CpGs. Associations between MNTs and CpGs will be replicated using data of a Swedish and a Japanese cohort. In Aim 1 and 2 we analyze associations in a backward approach: (1) from lung function at age 10 and 18 years to CpGs at birth and (2) from CpGs at birth to MNTs during gestation. In contrast, in Aim 3 we will analyze the data of the F2 generation in a forward manner. Aim 3 is to develop path-analytical models explaining a differential methylation of specific CpGs in response to prenatal MNTs and consequently predicting a deficit in lung function. We will measure lung function markers with Impulse Oscillometry at age 3 years and IOS and spirometry at 5-7 years of age in the F2 generation. Structural equation models will be implemented to link maternal MNTs and CpG sites to lung function markers in the F1 generation and will be replicated in F2. Our research team has a long track record of successful collaboration and associates epidemiological and biostatistical knowledge and metabolomic and epigenetic expertise with clinical/pulmonary partners. The proposal is of high importance since it ha s the potential to change the way pulmonary diseases are managed, being proactive during pregnancy and early childhood, rather than waiting for the individual to develop lung function deficit and symptoms later in life. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH FOR PUBLIC HEALTH (NARRATIVE) The proposal will address markers for reduced lung function that are related to asthma in children and adults as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults. Using a birth cohort with three generations (grandparents, parents, and children), we will identify and replicate new epigenetic markers present at birth for specific genes that predict lung function; then we will detect and validate novel prenatal metabolic, nutritional, or toxic compounds that are associated with lung function via these neonatal epigenetic markers. F indings of this study will help to predict at birth whether a child is at risk of reduced lung function and thus will provide individual parents with knowledge empowering them to improve their child's health.",Effect of Prenatal Compounds on Adult Lung Function via Neonatal DNA Methylation,9176252,R01HL132321,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cysteine', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fetus', 'Figs - dietary', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Growth', 'Guanine', 'Individual', 'Japanese Population', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oscillometry', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Poison', 'Pregnancy', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Vitamins', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'empowered', 'epigenetic marker', 'forest', 'genome-wide', 'grandparent', 'improved', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'lung development', 'maternal serum', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'methyl group', 'mortality', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal influence', 'prenatal risk factor', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'screening']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2016,685363,6013508,0.11937655041000313
"Clinical Evaluation of Lung Motion Tracker for Improved Diagnosis and Treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer, one of the major tasks is to provide the dynamic images and tumor shapes that reflect the patient's real-time anatomy as the roadmap for guiding the delivery of radiation beams. One fundamental question for these applications is how to estimate such dynamic images, as well location and shape changes of tumor using available sensors to capture the respiratory motion. This proposal focuses on solving such a lung motion tracking problem by using our newly proposed high- dimensional surface to lung motion prediction model and considering the difference of each individuals, such as gender, size, and respiratory pattern. Specifically, we wil optimize the statistical models that capture the motion distribution from training samples and the nonlinear prediction model for accurate lung motion tracking and conduct extensive evaluation for the lung motion tracking system developed to validate its feasibility in clinic practice. Our goal is to develop an efficient, effective and robust lung motion tracking system for dynamic image guidance of the radiotherapy procedures. After this clinical data validation, such a technique can also be applied to image-guided intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lung motion tracking is essential for dynamic image-guided radiotherapy for lung cancer.

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primarily due to the lack of physical symptoms in the early stage, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Although high-resolution computed tomography (CT) has been proved to be a sensitive, non-invasive modality for visualizing small lung nodules, which could be the early manifestation of lung cancer, a considerable number of false positive detections are often resulted. Consequently, additional procedures, such as invasive biopsy / follow-up scans, are frequently needed to verify the nature of the indeterminate nodules. The negative effects associated with these over-diagnosis procedures, such as biopsy complications, exposure to additional radiation, patient anxiety, and economic cost, significantly limits the efficacy of CT screening for early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this project, we propose to develop a computer model to quantitatively assess the nature of indeterminate nodules using a longitudinal dataset. Unlike available investigations or lung cancer risk models, we will comprehensively quantify a wide variety of properties (features) of a nodule in an unprecedented detailed manner as well as their variations over time, and synergize them with patient demographic information (e.g., age, gender, smoke history) using machine learning techniques. Not only the image features of lung nodules but also their spatial relationship with respect to important lung landmarks as well as other smoke related lung abnormalities (e.g., emphysema) will be incorporated into this model. The output of this project, namely a novel computer tool, could aid clinicians to more accurately and efficiently assess the nature of indeterminate nodules, ultimately leading to the reduction of unnecessary harm and costs to patients and the healthcare system. All these will significantly improve the efficacy of CT for early lung cancer screening by maintaining its high sensitivity while reducing false positive findings. In terms of commercial potential, the developed tool could be easily integrated with the available image information systems at medical institutions by following the widely adopted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a novel computer tool for aiding in accurate assessment of indeterminate nodules. Its novelty lies in the incorporation of a large variety of image features and patient demographic information using machine learning techniques and a longitudinal dataset.

"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8894597,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,324901,673201228,0.11356817249068933
"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                ",Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes,8580179,F32EY022558,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'EP300 gene', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer therapy', 'clinically relevant', 'directed attention', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lung cancer screening', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2014,36508,327644200,0.11596049586371868
"EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our broad long-term goal is to develop a convenient, non-invasive, clinically-used blood biomarker test that can distinguish patients with lung cancer from patients with benign nodules for the early detection of lung cancer.  Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over-diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening, which adds both to their psychological and to their financial burden. It is urgent to develop new non-invasive methods such as identifying blood molecular biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.  Our immediate objective for this proposal is to identify blood lipid markers for the early detection of lung cancer. Lipids have numerous critical biological functions which include membrane structure, energy storage, and signal transduction. Lipids have also been implicated as playing roles in several human diseases, including lung cancer. However, studies generally have been focused on total levels of lipids in a class. Because individual species of a lipid class may have different functions, it is essential to measure their compositions. In the proposed study, we will adopt lipidomics technology which aims to quantify a cell's lipidome, identifying and quantifying individual lipid molecular species on a large scale using mass spectrometry. Our preliminary studies with lung and prostate cancer indicate this technology is robust and promising. We have identified a lipid profile difference between non-lung cancer and lung cancer plasma samples. The sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing non-cancer and lung cancer samples are over 90%. Our hypothesis is that lipidomics profiles will be different between lung cancer and non-malignant cancer plasma samples including benign pulmonary lesions and we will be able to define a lipid list as a predictive signature of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: 1) measure the levels of lipid species in human plasma from non-malignant and lung cancer biospecimens. 2) Mine lipid profile data to identify ""lipid markers"" that vary reproducibly between non-malignant samples and lung cancer samples. 3) Validate and test the predictive value of the lipid markers using independent samples.  Lipidomics is a rapidly developing novel technology that has not been applied to lung cancer studies. This work could lead to potentially new clinically used markers for early detection of lung cancer. Our findings may provide information that will lead to the development of novel lipid-related drugs to treat lung cancer. In the long term, linking our data with gene expression and proteomics data in lung cancer will give us a complete view of lipid metabolic pathways and networks, as well as new knowledge about their role in lung cancer development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to identify lipid biomarkers in human blood for the early detection of lung cancer using a new technology called lipidomics, which aims to measure all the lipids in a human body. We suppose the composition and amount of lipids in early-stage lung cancer patients are different from non-lung cancer patients. Based on this, we can distinguish cancer from non-cancer samples. Detecting lung cancer at earlier stages could reduce mortality rates 10- to 50-fold. The current CT scan approach has difficulty distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules. Patients are frequently over- diagnosed with poor specificity and require further invasive screening. Results from the proposed work will be of significant value to public health because we can eventually develop an invasive, accurate test tool to be clinically used for the early detection of lung cancer, which can save thousands of lives.            ",EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER USING METABOLOMIC LIPID PROFILING,8617255,R21CA164764,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Granuloma', 'Hamartoma', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lecithin', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung nodule', 'Lysophospholipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Non-Neoplastic Lung Disorder', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Sputum Cytology Screening', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'blood lipid', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'mass spectrometer', 'metabolomics', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2014,193675,55098220,0.22544182648862096
"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.          This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease. It will generate new experimental data for early detection of lung cancer, and has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer, a leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.

"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow.

"RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Despite improvements in its diagnosis and treatment, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The high degree of mortality associated with this cancer, and the spectrum of different treatment options (which themselves involve significant morbidity), creates a difficult situation in which a patient is faced with critical, if not life-changing decisons. In an effort to make informed decisions, many turn to the Internet to find information on their disease. However, the quality of information is variable; the information can be difficult for the layperson to comprehend; and patients can have considerable problems understanding how the information they find is specifically applicable to their individual circumstances.            The objective of this proposal is the development of a framework, named RUMI (Retrieving Understandable Medical Information), which challenges how cancer patients receive information today by making the process of care explicit to the patient, providing access to his/her medical record data in the direct context of a clinical guideline so they can see how decisions are made. The first step in our effort is the development of a comprehensive lung cancer knowledge and process model (LCKPM) that captures a clinical guideline and workflow. The LCKPM provides a foundation for connecting the patient's medical record to decision points and actions that occur over time, detailing the criteria in making a selection and the supporting rationale. Different layers in the LCKPM organize information, which provide links: to public information resources helping explicate unfamiliar medical jargon and concepts; to questions (and answers) that are frequently fielded by healthcare providers managing lung cancer patients; and to more meaningful clinical episodes as experienced by the patient. Based on the LCKPM, RUMI automatically maps a patient's medical record: free-text documents are analyzed via information extraction (IE) and natural language processing (NLP) methods, identifying key concepts and variables (e.g., as used in decisions). In parallel, we examine public web resources that provide consumer-level explanations and discussions of lung cancer; these sites are deconstructed into curated knowledge segments that can be used in more directed presentations to a given individual. The knowledge segments are used to explain medical concepts within a patient's reports; and the terminology within the clinical guideline process flow. Collectively, these developments implement an individually-tailored web portal that visualizes the patient's personal experience over the disease trajectory using a simplified event-driven timeline. The portal also provides customized information regarding clinical trials that the individual is eligible for, and pertinent past trials results. In addition to technical evaluation, the RUMI framework will be evaluated through the UCLA Lung Cancer Program's outpatient clinics in a controlled study to assess end impact. The result of this project will be a set of approaches to employ patients' own medical records and public information resources to inform and empower lung cancer patients as participants in their own healthcare and medical decision-making processes.             RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  In spite of the improvements in early diagnostic and therapeutic methods, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. In an effort to make informed decisions, these cancer patients frequently turn to the Internet to find information about their disease and potential treatment options; however, finding quality information is often problematic, the information is difficult to understand, and the relevance of the information to a patient�s own circumstances is often lost. The focus of this research is an informatics- based infrastructure to provide lung cancer patients with an automatically created, individually-tailored web portal that makes explicit their process of care, explaining decisions and choices using public information resources geared towards laypersons, thus better equipping users with the knowledge needed to make decisions.",RUMI: A patient portal for retrieving understandable medical information,8469083,R01LM011333,"['Accounting', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American Cancer Society', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Portal System', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Site', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'United States', 'Update', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'coping', 'design', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'experience', 'inclusion criteria', 'information framework', 'interest', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'model development', 'mortality', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'programs', 'response', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2013,304061,673201228,0.11356817249068933
"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                  Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high.

"Assessing Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules With Electrical Impedance Measurements    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thyroid nodules are present in a large fraction of healthy individuals. Between 4% and 7% of the United States adult population has palpable thyroid nodules, and up to 50% of American women older than age 50 have nodules that can be depicted on ultrasound. The vast majority (>95%) of thyroid nodules are benign. However, cancer risk increases with male gender, nodule size, extremes of age (< 30 and > 60 years), underlying autoimmune disease, nodule growth, personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure. Ultrasound imaging and Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) remain the mainstays of thyroid nodule evaluation. Unfortunately, 25% of patients who ultimately undergo FNAB of a thyroid nodule have indeterminate cytology. Many of these patients will require at least partial thyroidectomy purely for the purpose of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. Given that only 30% of these will ultimately prove to be malignant on surgical pathology, the majority of these lobectomies could potentially be avoided if better non-invasive methods existed to evaluate indeterminate nodules.

The overall diagnostic accuracy of EIS was encouraging but not sufficient for routine clinical use. We have developed a modified approach termed here Resonance Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (REIS) that should have substantially higher sensitivity and specificity for this very purpose.

"Transfer Rule Learning for Knowledge Based Biomarker Discovery and Predictive Bio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Predictive modeling of biomedical data arising from clinical studies for early detection, monitoring and prognosis of diseases is a crucial step in biomarker discovery. Since the data are typically measurements subject to error, and the sample size of any study is very small compared to the number of variables measured, the validity and verification of models arising from such datasets significantly impacts the discovery of reliable discriminatory markers for a disease. An important opportunity to make the most of these scarce data is to combine information from multiple related data sets for more effective biomarker discovery. Because the costs of creating large data sets for every disease of interest are likely to remain prohibitive, methods for more effectively making use of related biomarker discovery data sets continues to be important. Solution: This project develops and applies Transfer Rule Learning (TRL), a novel framework for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets, such as those generated from similar biomarker profiling studies. TRL alleviates the problem of data scarcity by providing automated ways to express, verify and use prior hypotheses generated from one data set while learning new knowledge via a related data set. This is the first study of transfer learning for biomarker discovery. Unlike other transfr learning approaches, TRL takes knowledge in the form of interpretable, modular classification rules, and uses them to seed learning of a rule model on a new data set. Classification rules simplify the extraction of discriminatory markers, and have been used successfully for biomarker discovery and verification in a non-integrative fashion. Specific Aims: This project tests the main hypothesis that TRL provides a mechanism for transfer learning of classification rules between related source and target data sets that improve performance on the target data, compared to learning without transfer. TRL will be evaluated using cross-validation performance of classification accuracy and transfer measures, on related groups of existing biomarker discovery datasets obtained from multiple experimental platforms for lung cancer detection and prognosis. A new set of independent validation data will be generated for early detection of lung cancer to test the models generated on pilot data. Insights into the impact of different modeling algorithms on transfer outcomes will be gleaned. Significance: The TRL framework and tool are important for combined analysis and interpretation of clinical data, as they support incremental building, verification and refinement of rule models for predictive biomedicine. The application of TRL to real-world biomarker discovery datasets can yield insights into novel interactions involving known markers, and the most reliable biomarkers for early detection of disease, particularly lung cancer. This project has the potential to help create new diagnostic screening tools for lung cancer detection. It allows foundational understanding of the use of transfer learning for integrative biomarker discovery that could lead to novel technologies for combining information from data and prior knowledge.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop highly-needed computational methods for integrative biomarker discovery from related but separate data sets produced by predictive molecular profiling studies of disease.

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,8082739,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2011,146799,136810522,0.11884781483904994

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model.

"High Density Association Analysis of Lung Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to identify novel susceptibility genes for lung cancer using a systematic genome- wide association-based approach. To achieve this goal, we are applying a two-stage design. This proposal builds upon an extensive resource of lung cancer cases and controls matched for smoking behavior, sex, and ethnicity who have been collected over many years at the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and on a recently approved proposal to the Center for Inherited Disease Research that is performing genotyping of 317,000 markers on 1200 Caucasian ever-smoking lung cancer cases and 1200 controls matched for ethnicity, age, smoking behavior, and sex. Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk.

"Genetic Susceptibility for Lung Cancer in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among African-Americans and this population has approximately 1/3 higher risk than Caucasians. Recently, collaborative studies that we and others have lead have identified regions on chromosomes 15q25, 5p15 and 6p21 that are highly significantly associated with lung cancer risk in Caucasians. The regions of association on chromosome 15q and 6p lie in areas of the genome that show very strong levels of linkage disequilibrium in Caucasians so that identifying the specific causal gene and causal variant(s) is problematic. In African- Americans, our preliminary study of the region on chromosome 15q25 shows a much more punctate pattern of linkage disequilbrium so that studies of the African-American population will provide a more precise localization of genetic variants. The preliminary data suggest the role of multiple genetic factors, but our initial studies conducted with a limited number of samples and SNPs are not yet sufficient to identify precisely the location(s) of causal variants. Our preliminary data show stronger effects on risks from SNPs on chromosomes 5p and 15q in African-Americans than in Caucasians. We therefore propose to genotype samples from three centers comprising over 1300 lung cancer cases and 1300 controls for 400 SNP loci in each of the three regions of interest. We will also genotype ancestry informative markers so that we can evaluate the ancestral background as a confounder. The first aim will perform dense SNP analysis in three genomic regions to sublocalize and characterize the impact on lung cancer risk in three genomic regions. The second aim will perform more detailed modeling to estimate joint effects of smoking, sex and genetic factors on lung cancer risk. This analysis will allow us to identify groups of African-American individuals at particularly higher risks for developing lung cancer.           Narrative African-Americans have particularly high risks of developing lung cancer, but genetic factors that influence their risk have not yet been studied. The goal of this research is to confirm and extent observations that SNPs in 3 genomic regions that associate with lung cancer risk in Caucasians also associate with lung cancer risk in African-Americans. To study enough African-Americans with lung cancer we are combining data from three research sites: the U.T. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the University of California - San Francisco, and Karmanos Institute. The first aim of our proposal will test that these three regions associate with lung cancer risk and estimate the risk associated with SNPs in this region. We will study 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (genetic markers) in each of the three regions to precisely localize which region of the genome is involved in influencing disease risk. The second aim will model the differential roles of sex, genetic factors, and smoking for these regions to delineate the impacts of these factors on risk and to identify specific subsets of individuals at highest risk for developing lung cancer.",Genetic Susceptibility for Lung Cancer in African Americans,7743910,R01CA141716,"['15q', '15q24', '15q25', '6p21', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosomes', 'Cisplatin', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Death Rate', 'Dependence', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Ethnic group', 'Funding', 'Gender Role', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymorphism Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Attributable Risks', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Survival Rate', 'TERT gene', 'Telomerase', 'Testing', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco smoking', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'case control', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'men', 'parent grant', 'sex', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,397997,175892898,0.1539820305916907

Our first aim is to analyze data from the completed first-stage of genotyping. For our second aim, we will complete the two-stage design, which is powered to detect associations with genotypic risk ratios of about 1.4 with a very stringent significance criterion of 1.7 x 10-7. We will genotype and analyze 3380 SNPs on 1200 lung cancer cases and 1200 controls. We will also analyze SNPs from 90 candidate genes identified through a systematic literature search as well as a limited number of SNPs in significant pathways. In our third aim we will genotype 400 never-smoking lung cancer cases and 400 controls for 946 SNP markers. To evaluate possible interethnic differences in the genetic control of lung cancer risk we will analyze 400 African-American lung cancer cases and 400 African- American controls (aim 4) for 946 SNP markers. In these 4 aims we are also including a panel of SNPs to estimate ancestry. In aim 5, we use machine learning approaches to develop models for characterizing gene-gene and gene-environment effects on lung cancer risk. Cases and controls have extensive epidemiological and family history data together with candidate gene and functional DNA repair measures. The end result of our analysis will substantively increase our understanding of the genetic etiology of lung cancer and gene-environment interactions that contribute to its causation. This is an experienced investigative team, using state of the art technology to perform a multistage genome-wide analysis on a large, uniquely well-characterized population of lung cancer cases and matched controls with rich functional data.

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,7448570,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2008,131394,136810522,0.11884781483904994

"Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The applicant describes a five year program leading to independent translational research related to pulmonary and critical care medicine.  Although trained as a neuroscientist, the investigator is motivated by clinical experience to propose a career dedicated to the development of molecular diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches to medicine, in particular to lung cancer and critical illness.  Practical skills in functional genomics, proteomics, molecular biology, biostatistics, and machine learning will be fostered in the laboratory of Dr. Todd Golub, himself an accomplished clinical scientist with a vital independent research program.  Director of Cancer Genomics at the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research, Dr. Golub is a pioneer and internationally recognized leader in the application of genomics approaches to cancer biology, especially classification and prognosis.  This immersion will be complemented by formal instruction in genomics and computational biology, and reinforced by active advising from a team of domain experts.        The proposed research plan starts from the tenet that delayed or inaccurate diagnoses can be lethal.  Most lung cancer patients present with advanced disease, when the prognosis is grave; many of the critically ill can be given no better than phenomenological descriptions of their disease.  The Human Genome Project and other developments in biology and technology have advanced unbiased, whole-genome discovery efforts for improved markers of disease.  The principal investigator will undertake such an effort, by 1) creating datasets by mass spectrometry from serum samples of lung cancer patients and controls; 2) defining signatures of disease using machine learning approaches; and 3) identifying proteins and peptides comprising the diagnostic signatures.  While the investigator hopes to develop functional lung cancer biomarkers, the methodologies are intended to be applicable throughout medicine.        The combined resources of the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and the Whitehead Institute will be available to the applicant.  These rich environments will promote the success of the serum biomarker discovery project, and the larger cultivation of the investigator towards a goal of independence and productivity in academic medicine. n/a",Serum Proteomic Biomarker Discovery in Lung Cancer,7251530,K08CA102159,"['Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinogenesis Mechanism', 'Carcinogens', 'Cessation of life', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development, Other', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'General Hospitals', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Limited Stage', 'Localized', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oligonucleotide Microarrays', 'Onset of illness', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Small Cell Carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'cancer classification', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'lung carcinogenesis', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'success', 'survivorship', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2007,135837,174094914,0.09668526526936637

"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.                                                                                              The goal of the proposed project is to develop a CAD system for early detection      of lung cancers on thoracic helical CT images. We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6994449,R01CA093517,"['calcification', 'calcium', 'calcium disorder', 'clinical research', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'human subject', 'lung neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2006,363111,641965656,0.20184782806078705

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed to          develop computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes for detection and                    characterization of pulmonary nodules in digital chest images. For development       of reliable and predictable CAD schemes, they proposed to establish a large          database with 2,000 cases of chest radiographs, which include 1,000 nodule           cases and 1,000 non-nodule cases, in collaboration with Richard M. Slone, M.D.,      Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, under a consortium       arrangement. An advanced CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules will be            developed by incorporating three subtraction techniques--temporal subtraction,       contralateral subtraction and energy subtraction--in order to achieve, on            average, a high sensitivity of 80-90% with a low false positive rate of              approximately 0.5 per chest image. They would investigate the usefulness of the      temporal subtraction technique in increasing the detection of subtle nodules         overlapped with ribs and also decreasing the number of false positives due to        rib-crossings, when a previous chest image of the same patient is available.         Contralateral subtraction, which is a novel technique for removal of peripheral      ribs in a single PA chest image, will be examined for enhancement in the             detection of overlapped nodules and reduction in the number of false positives.      They would also investigate the usefulness of energy subtraction soft-tissue         image for improved computerized detection of lung nodules in combination with        conventional chest images. In addition to the detection task, they would to          develop CAD schemes for characterization of nodules in order to distinguish          between benign and malignant nodules. This characterization task is to provide       the likelihood of malignance of lung nodules based on quantitative analysis of       image features of nodules detected by computer and/or by radiologists. With the      high level of detection performance that they expect to achieve, they propose        to develop a prototype CAD workstation and carry out a pilot study to examine        the clinical usefulness of CAD schemes on detection and characterization of          pulmonary nodules.                                                                                                                                                        n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY,6719070,R01CA062625,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'disease /disorder classification', 'human data', 'image processing', 'information systems', 'lung neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer radiodiagnosis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2004,397291,246330700,0.02004429900983683

"COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): An essential factor in lung         cancer survival is early detection, with up to 50% long term survival among          patients whose tumors are detected at clinical stage I. Unfortunately, only 15%      of lung cancers are currently detected at this stage. A major problem in early       detection is the limitation of chest radiography, the initial procedure for          detection of pulmonary nodules; it is estimated that 30% of positive nodules         are currently missed. Therefore, the applicants proposed to develop an advanced      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme that assists radiologists in detecting         pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs by providing them with a ""second              opinion."" The main obstacle to achieving a clinically acceptable level of            performance in such schemes is the large number of false-positive detections.        Thus, this proposal focuses on improving the performance of pulmonary nodule         detection by substantially reducing the number of false positives detected. The      specific aims are: (1) To establish image databases of pulmonary nodules for         development and evaluation of a CAD scheme by (a)extracting regions of interest      containing nodule candidates from an existing database, and (b) developing a         new database of digital chest images for evaluation of the CAD schemes; (2) To       develop methods for removal of normal anatomic structures by implementing            radiologists' visual analysis strategy that (a) identify regions with similar        normal anatomic structures in the lung, and (b) remove anatomic structures           through non-linear registration and subtraction; (3) To develop methods to           select and combine image features for reduction of false positives by (a)            extracting image features characteristic of nodules from                             normal-structure-subtracted regions, (b) by applying adaptive rule-based tests,      (c) combining features by artificial neural networks to obtain a single index        for the reduction of false positives, and (d) using genetic algorithms to            select features that are most effective in distinguishing nodules from false         positives; and (4) To evaluate the benefit of the overall CAD scheme by (a)          performing observer studies to estimate improvement of radiologists' diagnostic      accuracy in the detection of pulmonary nodules without and with computer aid,        and (b) performing pilot prospective studies for preclinical evaluation. The         hypothesis is that a CAD scheme with a clinically acceptable sensitivity and         specificity will substantially improve radiologists' accuracy in the detection       of pulmonary nodules. Such a high-performance CAD scheme should advance the          early detection of pulmonary nodules, and therefore has the potential to             improve the prognosis for patients.                                                                                                                                       n/a",COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES,6514433,R01CA085668,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cancer information system', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2002,169875,246330700,0.007519328231383245

A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6418479,R01CA093517,"['calcification', ' calcium', ' calcium disorder', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2002,360102,641965656,0.20184782806078705
"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed to          develop computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes for detection and                    characterization of pulmonary nodules in digital chest images. For development       of reliable and predictable CAD schemes, they proposed to establish a large          database with 2,000 cases of chest radiographs, which include 1,000 nodule           cases and 1,000 non-nodule cases, in collaboration with Richard M. Slone, M.D.,      Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, under a consortium       arrangement. An advanced CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules will be            developed by incorporating three subtraction techniques--temporal subtraction,       contralateral subtraction and energy subtraction--in order to achieve, on            average, a high sensitivity of 80-90% with a low false positive rate of              approximately 0.5 per chest image. They would investigate the usefulness of the      temporal subtraction technique in increasing the detection of subtle nodules         overlapped with ribs and also decreasing the number of false positives due to        rib-crossings, when a previous chest image of the same patient is available.         Contralateral subtraction, which is a novel technique for removal of peripheral      ribs in a single PA chest image, will be examined for enhancement in the             detection of overlapped nodules and reduction in the number of false positives.      They would also investigate the usefulness of energy subtraction soft-tissue         image for improved computerized detection of lung nodules in combination with        conventional chest images. In addition to the detection task, they would to          develop CAD schemes for characterization of nodules in order to distinguish          between benign and malignant nodules. This characterization task is to provide       the likelihood of malignance of lung nodules based on quantitative analysis of       image features of nodules detected by computer and/or by radiologists.

"COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): An essential factor in lung         cancer survival is early detection, with up to 50% long term survival among          patients whose tumors are detected at clinical stage I. Unfortunately, only 15%      of lung cancers are currently detected at this stage. A major problem in early       detection is the limitation of chest radiography, the initial procedure for          detection of pulmonary nodules; it is estimated that 30% of positive nodules         are currently missed. Therefore, the applicants proposed to develop an advanced      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme that assists radiologists in detecting         pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs by providing them with a ""second              opinion."" The main obstacle to achieving a clinically acceptable level of            performance in such schemes is the large number of false-positive detections.        Thus, this proposal focuses on improving the performance of pulmonary nodule         detection by substantially reducing the number of false positives detected. The      specific aims are: (1) To establish image databases of pulmonary nodules for         development and evaluation of a CAD scheme by (a)extracting regions of interest      containing nodule candidates from an existing database, and (b) developing a         new database of digital chest images for evaluation of the CAD schemes; (2) To       develop methods for removal of normal anatomic structures by implementing            radiologists' visual analysis strategy that (a) identify regions with similar        normal anatomic structures in the lung, and (b) remove anatomic structures           through non-linear registration and subtraction; (3) To develop methods to           select and combine image features for reduction of false positives by (a)            extracting image features characteristic of nodules from                             normal-structure-subtracted regions, (b) by applying adaptive rule-based tests,      (c) combining features by artificial neural networks to obtain a single index        for the reduction of false positives, and (d) using genetic algorithms to            select features that are most effective in distinguishing nodules from false         positives; and (4) To evaluate the benefit of the overall CAD scheme by (a)          performing observer studies to estimate improvement of radiologists' diagnostic      accuracy in the detection of pulmonary nodules without and with computer aid,        and (b) performing pilot prospective studies for preclinical evaluation. The         hypothesis is that a CAD scheme with a clinically acceptable sensitivity and         specificity will substantially improve radiologists' accuracy in the detection       of pulmonary nodules.
