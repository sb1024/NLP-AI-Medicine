"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10074037,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,18249,338121506,0.042309443840432163
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma Abstract Singers are known to be at an increased risk of developing voice disorders and often represent a large percentage of patients who are seen at voice clinics. One of the most common disorders seen in singers is vocal fold nodules that result from chronic trauma to vocal fold tissue, referred to as phonotrauma or phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH). While PVH in singers is thought do be due to the simple increase in vocal demands associated with singing, it continues to be unclear why some singers develop PVH though others do not. One factor that has been shown to be more highly associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders is personality, as described in the “Trait Theory of Voice Disorders.” Testing of this theory has provided empirical evidence that those with PVH score significantly higher on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than individuals with healthy voices. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information about whether personality relates to PVH in a similar way to singers. We hypothesize that singers with PVH will score significantly higher on personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than singers without PVH. Additionally, information is also lacking about whether personality traits correlate with daily vocal behaviors. PVH in singers is often assumed to be the sole result of how the voice is used when singing. Our preliminary work using an ambulatory voice monitor and an automated singing classifier has shown a larger number of significant differences between singers with PVH and normal controls during speaking than during singing across a full week of monitoring. We expect that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be significantly correlated with ambulatory measures that reflect the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load, specifically in speech. We hypothesize that these relationships will be stronger in singers with PVH compared to healthy singers. The goal of the proposed project is to determine if certain personality traits are significantly related to the presence of PVH in singers and/or to the daily vocal behaviors that could contribute to the etiology and pathophysiology of phonotrauma in singers. We will administer a multidimensional personality inventory to singers diagnosed with PVH and vocally healthy matched-singers. We will compare each trait scale for singers with PVH and healthy singers using a t- test and then determine which traits are more predictive of patient status using a stepwise binary logistic regression. Each participant will also be monitored for one typical week using an ambulatory voice monitor. Relationships between personality traits scales and voice-related parameters will be conducted using Pearson's r correlations, and linear multiple regression will be used to determine which traits are the most predictive of vocal behavior. The new knowledge produced by this project could be used to aid in improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vocal nodules in singers, particularly with respect to predicting which singers are at a greater risk for developing vocal fold nodules, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment. Laura Toles PROJECT NARRATIVE Singers are known carry an elevated risk of developing voice disorders, specifically those that are presumed to result from chronic vocal fold tissue trauma such as vocal fold nodules. However, despite the increased voice use requirements of singing, not all singers develop vocal fold nodules. This study aims to identify the influence that personality traits have on ambulatory voice behaviors to differentiate singers with vocal fold nodules from singers with healthy voices. Specifically, we hypothesize that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be more strongly correlated with the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load in speech in singers with vocal fold nodules. We expect that knowledge gained from this project will be useful to improve prevention of vocal fold nodules through prediction of individual risk for singers, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment.",The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma,10141147,F31DC019284,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Behavior', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nodule', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Personality inventories', 'Prevention', 'Risk', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Vocal Cord Nodule', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'social', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tissue trauma', 'trait', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,F31,2020,33120,1683766,-0.04872700883506917
"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,83544663,-0.008835796016246976
"The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence PROJECT SUMMARY Few effective interventions exist for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which are associated with significant impairment, high rates of disability, and substantial public health costs. The prevalence of NDDs has increased considerably over the past two decades, and children with NDDs make up the largest proportion of youth that seek mental health treatment. Thus, novel approaches for understanding NDDs and identifying potential treatment targets for these disorders are needed. NDDs often have comorbid presentations and shared symptomatology (e.g., impaired social functioning), which suggests that using a transdiagnostic approach to study NDDs may be informative. This approach could reveal modifiable factors and underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be targeted through intervention to reduce neurodevelopmental symptomatology. Social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) may be a salient protective factor for youth with neurodevelopmental symptomatology. An important neural correlate for social functioning appears to be functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), which is involved in detection of relevant stimuli (e.g., changes in other's emotional expressions).Thus, social connectedness and related connectivity within the SN may be predictive of neurodevelopmental outcomes. The potential protective role of these factors may be particularly salient during adolescence, which is a vulnerable period for many of the negative outcomes associated with NDDs. The proposed longitudinal project will capitalize on the multi-level framework of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study by using psychosocial, functional neuroimaging, and cognitive data from two timepoints (i.e., baseline and one-year follow-up) to assess neurodevelopmental functioning in a sample of >11,500 youth in early adolescence. The project will be conducted at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research, which is an ABCD study site. The aims of the proposed project are threefold: to determine whether 1) social connectedness is associated with SN functional connectivity cross-sectionally; 2) social connectedness predicts future neurodevelopmental function; and 3) SN functional connectivity predicts future neurodevelopmental function. These aims will be assessed using linear mixed effects models with relevant covariates included (e.g., baseline neurodevelopmental function, youth ethnicity, youth gender, and family income). The proposed study has an exploratory aim of utilizing a data-driven, machine learning approach to identify additional modifiable factors (e.g., sleep, physical activity, screen time) that predict future neurodevelopmental function. The project is novel in that it takes a transdiagnostic approach to studying NDDs, it is longitudinal, and it has the potential for replication and extension as future data are released. Results from the project could have meaningful clinical relevance with the potential for identifying treatment targets for future interventions aiming to improve neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Because neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are associated with significant impairment and public health costs and few psychological interventions are known to be effective for reducing neurodevelopmental symptomatology, identification of novel treatment targets for individuals with NDDs is needed. The present longitudinal study will address this need by utilizing a large, nationally-representative sample of youth (N = 11,500+; age 9-10) to examine the roles of social connectedness (i.e., extracurricular involvement, family dynamics, and relationships with peers and parents) and related neural connectedness (i.e., functional connectivity within the salience network) in predicting future neurodevelopmental functioning (indexed by both parent-reported symptoms and objective executive function tasks). Results from this study could therefore delineate modifiable social factors and underlying neural mechanisms that are protective against neurodevelopmental symptomatology in early adolescence and inform future clinical research.",The Role of Social and Neural Connectedness in Predicting Neurodevelopmental Functioning in Adolescence,10066511,F31HD103340,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical activity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'data collection site', 'developmental psychology', 'disability', 'early adolescence', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait', 'tv watching']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,F31,2020,44712,89437,-0.002870225454081899
"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,9990180,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,550947887,0.002512081995205988
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM).

"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,9952648,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,129600,146629556,-0.007759121788503164
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,533302350,-0.006488838141497112
"Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence Project Summary Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23 application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award. The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity, cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays, and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross- sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current application will make important advances in understanding the nature of early markers of risk for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, otherwise known as psychotic-like experiences. Specifically, we do not yet understand why some individuals go on to develop more severe forms of psychotic-like experiences (i.e., sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences) and why for some individuals these experiences are transient. The current application will make significant strides in understanding the most important factors (such as family history and cognition) distinguishing sustained from transient distressing psychotic-like experiences, as well as understanding the clinical importance of these symptoms (including how many individuals with sustained distressing psychotic-like experiences seek treatment or have problems in school or at homes as a result of these symptoms).",Cross-sectional and longitudinal predictors of distressing psychotic-like experiences in childhood and adolescence,10054751,K23MH121792,"['11 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Occupational', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'aged', 'attenuated psychosis syndrome', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'structured data', 'success', 'theories']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,162963,533594881,0.025462376129241616
"Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD Project Summary This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) will facilitate Dr. Leikauf’s development into an independent researcher and child psychiatrist. It will provide the foundation for him to meaningfully improve strategies for cost-effective personalization of care for ADHD and related emotional disorders in diverse practice settings through a deeper understanding of the underlying phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent and functionally impairing, yet phenotypically heterogeneous. Despite the complexity of the phenotype, the diagnosis is most often made using DSM-based behavioral symptom rating scales during short visits in busy pediatric settings. Additionally, current treatments are widely used but have not been demonstrated to improve functional outcomes. Currently, treatment selection involves significant trial-and-error based on caregiver’s subjective report of symptomatic improvement. Cost-effective, objective measures that would aid in personalized treatment selection and address the full range of dysfunction for children with ADHD are critically needed. The heterogeneity of the disorder has limited the development of such tools. Until now, the field has relied on subtypes that have limited validity and are based exclusively on symptom rating scales. Recent developments in our ability to collect and analyze multidimensional data for individual subjects provide a new opening for progress in this crucial area. The project will use two multi-dimensional datasets from completed clinical trials as well as generate data from a smaller, prospective study. The anticipated outcomes are as follows: 1) identification of more phenotypically homogeneous groups of children with ADHD at baseline 2) identification of more homogeneous groups based on creating a multivariate classifier informed by mechanistic response to treatment, and 3) validation of classification schema. Dr. Leikauf’s specific training goals, in collaboration with his mentorship team, include acquisition of knowledge, experience, and skills in the following areas relevant to the proposed work: 1) modern machine-learning statistical techniques that allow reliable inferences to be drawn from high dimensional data with non-linear relationships between variables; 2) mentored experience conducting a multi- method/multi-dimensional prospective study with the goal of identifying personalized therapeutic targets 3) additional translational research/clinical experience to understand what is currently known about ADHD and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction including working memory, sustained attention, and response inhibition, and 4) training in acquisition and analysis of EEG. The results should have immediate clinical impact and provide the foundation for a future prospective personalized therapeutics trial. The experiences in this proposal, if awarded, will also develop Dr. Leikauf’s abilities and thereby enable him to have a fundamental impact on mental health treatment for children and adolescents. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder affects at least 5% of children, resulting in significant psychosocial impairment and predisposing children to very high rates of later psychiatric disorders. However, current treatments do not work for all children, do little to improve long-term functional outcomes, and, in practice, are discontinued by approximately half of families within 1-3 years due to poor tolerability or perceived lack of long-term efficacy. Personalized targeting of treatments to maximize benefit and minimize harms for each individual is urgently needed but has been stymied by our limited understanding of the heterogeneous relationships between self-report, cognitive, and physiologic measures of the symptoms of the disorder; this proposal aims to use modern computational approaches to integrate information across these different measures in order to identify more homogeneous ADHD subtypes based in neurologic and cognitive deficits rather than self-report.","Integration of markers across physiologic, behavioral, and self-report levels at baseline and in response to treatment to characterize novel subtypes in youth with ADHD",10054894,K23MH121650,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional disorder', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Youth', 'atomoxetine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cognitive testing', 'cost effective', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'personalized therapeutic', 'practice setting', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'sustained attention', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational clinical trial', 'treatment response']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,560644462,-0.02181398530705212
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity.

"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual. The goal of this K23 proposal is to characterize the digital phenotype of bipolar disorder in adolescents in order to prospectively predict mood symptoms, creating an opportunity to reduce the harmful effects of recurrent episodes.",The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms,9996797,K23MH120505,"['Accelerometer', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agitation', 'Android', 'Award', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diurnal Rhythm', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'clinically significant', 'common symptom', 'computer science', 'cost', 'digital', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'meter', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'sensor', 'service utilization', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2020,195480,30160331,0.007267178219226603
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9995592,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social relationships', 'social space', 'social structure', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2020,211875,415711940,0.001212606523211247
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,9892136,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,233832,570146095,0.02493904582257096
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10107959,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2020,248800,673201228,0.029142986877615677
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,161094826,-0.010218026093842468
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10156737,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2020,249000,90710179,-0.003667755301407254
"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,9980111,R01MH120091,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2020,317000,83544663,0.05803136334484418
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk Summary  Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative  Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview-based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",2/5 CAPER Computerized assessment of psychosis risk,9978241,R01MH120088,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,377685,66720547,0.05590372249089957
"Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19 Project Summary/Abstract States and localities nationwide are taking unprecedented steps to reduce public health threats posed by COVID-19, including school closures affecting >50 million youth. The pandemic has also caused families extreme financial hardship, sudden unemployment, and distress. This combination of collective trauma, social isolation, and economic recession drastically increases risk for adolescent major depression (MD): already the lead cause of disability in youth. However, youth MD treatments face problems of potency and accessibility. Up to 65% of youth receiving MD treatment fail to respond, partly due to MD’s heterogeneity: an MD diagnosis reflects >1400 possible symptom combinations, highlighting the need for treatments matched to personal need. Treatment accessibility issues are similarly severe. Before the pandemic, <50% of youth with MD accessed any treatment at all; newfound financial strain will further preclude families’ capacity to afford care for their children. It is thus critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to buffer against youth MD in the context of COVID-19, along with strategies to match such interventions with youth most likely to benefit. This project will integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale SSI research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing adolescent MD during COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1,200 youth with elevated MD symptoms, ages 12-16), Aim 1 is to test whether (1) evidence-based SSIs improve proximal targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which has predicted longer-term SSI response) and 3- month clinical outcomes (MD severity) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral MD symptoms are most impactful in this context. In a fully-online trial, youths recruited from across the U.S. will be randomized to 1 of 3 self-administered SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, targeting behavioral MD symptoms (anhedonia; activity withdrawal); an SSI teaching growth mindset, the belief that personal traits are malleable, targeting cognitive MD symptoms (e.g. hopelessness); or a control SSI. Per baseline, post-SSI, and 3-month follow-up data, we will test each SSI’s relative benefits, versus the control, in the context of COVID-19. Results will reveal whether SSIs targeting behavioral versus cognitive symptoms differentially reduce overall MD severity in this context. Aim 2 is to test whether (and, if so, which of) SSIs can impact COVID-19 specific trauma and anxiety symptoms, informing whether novel, COVID-19-tailored supports may be needed to reduce pandemic-specific mental health sequelae. Aim 3 is to test person-level and contextual predictors of SSI response, via machine-learning techniques, regardless of overall intervention effects observed. Given MD’s heterogeneity, we will test whether baseline symptoms (e.g., having more severe cognitive or behavioral MD symptoms) predict response to SSIs targeting different symptom types. We will also test exposure to COVID-19-related adversities (e.g. parent job loss; loved one hospitalized for COVID-19) and general disadvantage (e.g. family low-income; racial minority status) forecast SSI response. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale single-session intervention (SSI) research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing depression in adolescents in the context of COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1200 adolescents), goals are to test whether evidence- based SSIs improve proximal targets (hopelessness, perceived agency, anhedonia) and clinical outcomes 3 months later (depression symptoms and COVID-19-related anxiety and trauma) in adolescents experiencing depression; whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral depression symptoms produce more favorable outcomes, versus an active control; and whether individual profiles of symptoms or COVID-19-related adversity exposure predicts individual-level SSI response. Results may identify novel, immediately actionable strategies to matching adolescents to targeted SSIs based on personal needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19",10164526,DP5OD028123,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Dropout', 'Economic Recession', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Administration', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Unemployment', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Youth', 'active control', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'loved ones', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'response', 'social media', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'trauma symptom', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",OD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,DP5,2020,392813,77607041,0.054798491104048

"Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Down syndrome (DS) is a common chromosomal disorder that results from the triplication of chromosome 21. Comorbid medical conditions frequently occur among individuals with DS; however, opthalamic disorders such as keratoconus occurs 6 times more often among this population as compared to the general population. Keratoconus is a known multifactorial, progressive, degenerative disease of the cornea; however, the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Our recent work has found that hormone-regulated Prolactin-Induced Protein (PIP) is a potential biomarker of keratoconus but the link between DS and keratoconus remains unclear. Pathway analysis has further linked comorbid DS and keratoconus through gonadotropins and serum amyloid A1 (SAA), a protein linked in a series of studies to cognitive dysfunction among adults with DS. The proposed study aims to determine and validate the role of gonadotropins in the DS population with the keratoconus co-morbidity with the long-term goal to better understand the underlying mechanisms that result in increased risk for ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus among this population. This pilot study will include n=90 participants (n=30 DS; n=30 comorbid DS and Keratoconus; n=30 healthy controls). All participants will provide biofluid samples of tears and plasma, which will be assayed on an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform. Analyses will be performed using R and SPSS 24 (IBM) in a series of steps. Support Vector Machine (SVM) analyses will be applied to examine the use of biomarkers to detect disease presence (i.e. keratoconus comorbidity). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses will help with variable selection in order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the models. Biomarkers will include hormone specific (LSH, LH, GNRH, LHR, FSHR, GNRHR) as well as a panel of plasma proteins including biomarkers of inflammation linked with cognitive dysfunction (SAA, CRP, ICAM1, VCAM1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-5, IL-7, Eotaxin-3, TARC, A2M, B2M, FVII, TNC, Adiponectin, FABP-3, IL-18, PPY, TPO and I-309). Diagnosis of keratoconus will be utilized as the dependent variable. If successful, data obtained from this study could help facility the development of a screening tool for detecting individuals with DS who are at risk for development of keratoconus, with the goal of defining potential enrollment into clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vision disorders occur in nearly all individuals with Down syndrome (DS) with development of ocular co-morbidities such as keratoconus, a cornea dystrophy, occurring 6 times more often in this population as compared to the general population. Recent work from our group has found differences in sex hormones (i.e. androgen and estrogen levels) among individuals with keratoconus as compared to healthy controls but this difference was impacted by age and gender. Information gained from this study will (1) reveal the relationship between gonadotropins among individuals with DS and ocular comorbidities, specifically keratoconus, and (2) provide insight into the association between known plasma biomarkers including serum amyloid A1 and gonadotrophins among those with DS as well as those with comorbid keratoconus and DS.",Exploring the role of gonadotropins in Down syndrome,10108508,R21EY032320,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Androgens', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blepharitis', 'Blood', 'CCL1 gene', 'CCL17 gene', 'CCL26 gene', 'Cataract', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome 21', 'Clinical Trials', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Corneal dystrophy', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Eye Development', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Future', 'GNRH1 gene', 'GNRH2 gene', 'GNRHR gene', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Hormones', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Gonadotropins', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'ICAM1 gene', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interleukin-10', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-7', 'Keratoconus', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Luteinizing Hormone', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic Nystagmus', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Play', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prolactin', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Readiness', 'Refractive Errors', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Strabismus', 'TNF gene', 'Thinness', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Vision Disorders', 'Visual Acuity', 'Weight', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'insight', 'link protein', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'programs', 'receptor', 'sex', 'support vector machine']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,R21,2020,403584,31777928,-0.009342888644842479
"Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study Efforts to decipher biological signatures for mental illness now focus increasingly on adolescence, a period of rapid brain development that immediately precedes the peak age of onset for many disorders. Maturation of the cerebral cortex during this time has long been thought to mediate emergence of early symptoms. However, while specific cortical changes have been implicated in a small number of specific syndromes, for the most part, patterns in cortical development that underlie the differentiation of psychopathology remain uncertain. The ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to align emergence of specific patterns of psychopathology with specific changes in cortical maturation. Over the next 5 years, ABCD will obtain annual, standardized measures dimensional psychopathology, and biennial MRI scans, of 11,875 youths across 21 US-based sites, covering age 9 to 16. The proposed studies will leverage this longitudinal design to discover regionally- and temporally-specific features of cortical development that associate with emergence of dimensional psychopathology, and then to relate these patterns to specific profiles of underlying genomic and environmental risk. Analysis of baseline data from age 9-10, included in this application, indicates that psychopathology is in early stages of differentiation, although already strongly related to polygenic risk for child-onset disorders, and to well- established pre- and post-natal environmental insults. Aim 1 of the proposed studies will juxtapose clinical and imaging data from baseline through three follow-up time points, focusing primarily on whether departures from neurotypical age-related cortical thinning trajectories (assessed via intercept, slope, and quadratic indices) associate with emergence of specific dimensions of illness. The precise temporal alignment of clinical and cortical thinning trajectories will take an initial step towards inferring causal relationships, which will be further substantiated through triangulation with genomic (Aim 2) and environmental (Aim 3) risk profiles. Polygenic scoring methods developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium will be used to determine whether cortical maturation trajectories developed in Aim 1 mediate relationships between genomic risk and emergent dimensional psychopathology. Then, using data from hundreds of environmental measures that canvass participants’ daily activities, nutrition, life stressors, socioeconomic status, family dynamics, neighborhood safety, and numerous other factors, we will use novel machine learning methods to develop profiles of exposomic risk factors that predict emergent dimensional psychopathology, and determine whether cortical maturation patterns mediate the relationship between environmental risk profiles and clinical course. By the conclusion of the proposed studies we hope to establish specific cortical signatures that bridge causal factors with emergent psychopathology in adolescence, and that can be leveraged to develop new preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Adolescence is a critical period for emergence of a range of psychiatric syndromes, as well as for maturation of the cerebral cortex. Investigators have long presumed these events to be linked, potentially in ways that can predict specific clinical outcomes, but until now we have lacked data from sufficiently large, prospective studies to establish definitive or tractable patterns. Leveraging data from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (n=11,875), we will map emergent psychopathology across a range of symptoms to specific patterns of cortical development from age 9 to 16, and anchor these relationships to mediating genomic and environmental risk factors.",Alignment of cortical development trajectories with emergent dimensional psychopathology and related risk factors among early adolescents in the ABCD Study,10096054,R01MH124694,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family dynamics', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Plant Roots', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scoring Method', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'critical period', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'neighborhood safety', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal', 'psychiatric genomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'standardize measure', 'stressor', 'theories']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,413200,551214295,0.014543966551407878
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups.

"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients,10157747,R41MH122201,"['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Medication', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Financial cost', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'New Mexico', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Ontario', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatrist', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adulthood', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'web portal']",NIMH,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GROUP,R41,2020,437555,437555,-0.013403946186088485
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Positive and Negative Valence Systems Underlying Suicide in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a major public health concern in adolescents and the second leading cause of death in this age group, highlighting the need to investigate suicide in adolescents. The two most prominent risk factors for completed suicide in youth are a past suicide attempt and a diagnosis of a depressive episode, each independently representing a 10- to 30-fold increased risk for completed suicide. However, while over 80% of suicidal youth present with depressive symptoms at the time of the attempt, only 30% of depressed youth will ever attempt suicide. These data suggest that depressed adolescents with prior suicide attempts represent a distinct neurobiological subgroup. However, at present, we have no biomarkers to identify those depressed youth who will engage in suicidal behavior. This proposal addresses this concern. Our proposed model is: (1) anhedonia is associated with heightened suicidal risk in depressed youth; (2) both positive valence (PVS) deficits (reward expectancy, attainment, positive prediction error) and negative valence (NVS) hyperactivity (negative prediction error, pain avoidance) contribute to anhedonia and underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth; (3) the habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a key role in PVS/NVS processes by inhibiting reward signaling in response to pain and loss; and (4) recent advances in high-resolution MRI address prior technical constraints in studying small structures such as the Hb. These advances now allow us to study the neuronal circuitry underlying PVS and NVS in a neuroanatomically rigorous framework. In support, we documented that of adolescent depression’s core symptoms, only anhedonia, not irritability, was associated with suicidality among depressed youth. Similarly, we found that both anhedonia and entrapment were independently associated with suicidality in acutely suicidal hospitalized individuals. We also developed the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks and identified brain function during reward anticipation, attainment, and positive and negative prediction errors. Notably, both RPET and a thermal pain task elicited measurable Hb activation. Additionally, utilizing an optimized segmentation and seeding approach, we mapped Hb intrinsic functional connectivity in adults and in adolescents with psychiatric symptoms. Building upon our work, we propose a tightly integrative study to test the overall hypothesis that both PVS deficiency and NVS hyperactivity underlie suicidal behavior in depressed youth. We will study 30 suicidal and 30 non-suicidal depressed adolescents, ages 12-17, group matched for age, sex, and handedness. All will have comprehensive clinical evaluations (diagnoses, behavioral measures, computerized reward task). Neuroimaging studies will include structural MRI, resting-state and task fMRI (RFT, RPET, thermal pain). Machine learning algorithms will be used to examine which PVS/NVS processes predict suicidal behavior in depressed youth.  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our overall goal is to better understand the mechanisms contributing to suicide in adolescent depression, the cohort with the highest suicidal risk in youth. Using novel neuroimaging and modelling approaches, we will test the overall hypothesis that neural processes underlying both positive valence deficiency and negative valance hyperactivity play a key role in suicidal behavior in adolescent depression.

"Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are severe mental illnesses with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. The most widely used empirically supported treatment for EDs (cognitive behavior therapy) is only efficacious for ~50% of individuals. This low response rate is due to the fact that EDs are heterogeneous conditions with diverse symptom trajectories that are not adequately addressed in current “one-size-fits-all” psychotherapies. Until we can identify what maintains or exacerbates individual symptoms, clinicians will continue to have difficulty accurately predicting prognosis and will have no empirical guidance to develop targeted treatment plans to promote recovery. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application of network theory will enable the identification of cognitive-behavioral symptom networks that maintain and ‘trigger’ EDs both between and within individuals. Our study goals are to (1) identify individual ED ‘trigger’ symptoms (cognitions, behaviors, affect, and physiology) and (2) correlate trigger symptoms with real-time physiological data to create an algorithm predicting onset of ED behaviors. These goals will ultimately identify symptoms that prevent full remission and lead to relapse. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach combined with novel, cutting-edge advances in network science. We will collect intensive real- time data on cognitions, behavior, affect, and physiology using mobile and sensor-technology from 120 individuals with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical AN, and bulimia nervosa across 30 days. At 1-month and 6-month follow ups we will assess ED outcomes (e.g., remission status, ED behaviors) to test if ‘trigger’ symptoms predict ED outcomes. Network science and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques will allow us, for the first time, to discover whether certain trigger symptoms predict worse outcomes. Specific aims are to (1) develop personalized networks to identify which cognitive, behavioral, affective, and physiological symptoms maintain EDs and predict ED outcomes and (2) utilize sensor data to identify physiological patterns both within and across people that correlate with core maintaining symptoms and that predict ED behaviors. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data collection methods, all remote procedures, novel advances in network science and sensor-technology, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which personalized symptoms trigger EDs. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that contribute to symptom network variation within individuals, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat EDs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will identify the maintaining symptoms of eating disorders within individuals. The proposed research has significant public health relevance, as it will lead to personalized, novel, effective treatments that promote full remission and decrease the high societal burden associated with eating disorders. The proposed research is relevant to NIH’s precision medicine initiative, as it will identify within-person, maintenance symptoms of eating disorders, leading to personalized treatments delivered via mobile or sensor technology.",Personalized Networks and Sensor Technology Algorithms of Eating Disorder Symptoms Predicting Eating Disorder Outcomes,10044077,R15MH121445,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anorexia Nervosa', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binge Eating', 'Bulimia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epilepsy', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'food restriction', 'innovation', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'severe mental illness', 'smartphone Application', 'standard care', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'treatment planning', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R15,2020,463165,73765201,0.012144718049677095
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9952129,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,501996,340417756,0.017598774255324662
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10019727,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,502902,929426,0.01281946254059724
"Buprenorphine Effect on Suicidal Behavior Mortality and morbidity related to suicidal behavior and opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased significantly over the past decade. These two public health crises are intertwined at multiple levels.  Medications for OUD, especially buprenorphine, have the potential to decrease illicit opioid use and reduce the multiple negative consequences of OUD, including fatal and nonfatal overdose, criminal justice involvement, infectious complications, and misuse of other substances. In addition, several small randomized trials of buprenorphine treatment in treatment-resistant depression (with or without co-occurring OUD) suggest that buprenorphine may reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. No conceivable randomized trial, however, would be large enough to assess effects of buprenorphine on suicidal behavior.  Consequently, we propose a large observational study to evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with OUD, including those with and without co- occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We propose to assemble data from four MHRN health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million. This work will take advantage of methods successfully implemented in previous MHRN research and research by our HCSRN Addictions Research Network.  Valid causal inference will require appropriate methods to account for confounding by indication (i.e. people with OUD treated with buprenorphine have higher or lower pre-existing risk of suicidal behavior than people not treated with buprenorphine). Choice of the optimal method will depend on patterns observed in actual data (e.g. rates and correlates of buprenorphine use), but we anticipate considering the following: • Propensity-score matching using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Propensity-score weighting using machine learning-derived propensity scores • Disease risk score adjustment using machine learning-derived suicide risk prediction scores Using this data resource and these analytic methods, we will address the following specific questions: 1) Overall effect: Among people with recognized OUD, how does initiation of buprenorphine treatment affect  risk of suicidal behavior over the following 90 days compared to risk among otherwise similar people with  OUD not initiating buprenorphine treatment? 2) Heterogeneity of effect: Does any effect of initiating buprenorphine vary according to:  a. Means or mechanism of suicidal behavior (opioid overdose vs. other overdose vs. self-injury)?  b. Presence/absence of co-occurring mood disorder or severe mental illness? 3) Specificity of effect: Are effects observed for buprenorphine also observed for alternative medications for treatment of OUD (e.g. naltrexone)? This large observational study will evaluate the effects of initiating buprenorphine treatment on subsequent suicidal behavior among people with opioid use disorder, including those with and without co-occurring mental health conditions or other known risk factors for suicidal behavior. We will use comprehensive health records data from four large health systems serving a combined member/patient population of approximately 11 million.

In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,41751724,-0.006314862849899404
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,551214295,0.05014649312229951
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9836889,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,563046,44711126,0.06577243336706053
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States.

In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9985102,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,603973,227555357,0.01644086362737255
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9914128,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,640014,45341731,0.026629273666662852
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,9858600,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,648991,164685352,-0.00010108716261685545
"Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence ABSTRACT  Interventions in clinical settings, such as the emergency department (ED), are an opportunity for interpersonal firearm violence prevention, particularly among youth, whom interpersonal firearm violence disproportionately affects. A crucial prerequisite to successful clinical interventions is an accurate gauge of risk, to ensure the judicious allocation of scarce resources; providing that missing prerequisite is the primary goal of the proposed work. Machine learning methods, in contrast to traditional inferential statistical models, are distinguished by their emphasis on prospective prediction, and have enhanced clinical prediction in several fields, including heart disease, cancer diagnosis and outcomes, PTSD, suicide risk, and substance use, among others. Yet, with the exception of the SAFETY score—developed by the current investigative team—machine learning methods have not been leveraged to prospectively predict firearm violence. In this proposed work our research objectives are two-fold: 1) Externally validate the SAFETY score by determining its ability to predict firearm violence involvement within the next year on a new data set; and 2) Improve the SAFETY score by conducting a comparative analysis of four powerful machine learning methods: elastic net penalized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and boosting (ensemble) methods. In this way, we are responding to Objective One: Research to help inform the development of innovative and promising opportunities to enhance safety and prevent firearm-related injuries, deaths, and crime. This approach is innovative because it builds upon the only work to apply machine learning methods to firearm violence prediction, and it is a promising opportunity to prevent firearm injuries because it will a) provide an explicit gauge of future firearm violence risk; and b) characterize risk factor effects in terms of their prospective prediction ability, unlike any prior research. Thus this research will both identify individuals in most need of intervention, and also point to potentially modifiable predictive factors. Properly addressing this research question in a generalizable way requires a contemporary data set with 1) a focus on a high-need, yet broad, study population; 2) comprehensive baseline measures that provide a broad basis for prediction; and 3) geographic variability (Midwest, West Coast, and East Coast) that enhances generalizability. Thus, we will recruit 1,500 youth age 18-24 from urban EDs in three broadly different locales—Flint, Philadelphia, and Seattle—and administer a baseline survey covering several domains of potential risk factors for future violence, and follow up with those youth at 6- and 12-months to ascertain the primary outcome—firearm violence involvement (as victim or perpetrator)—as well as the secondary outcomes: high-risk firearm behaviors, non-firearm violence, and violent injury. Because this work requires a prospective longitudinal study, we are applying for Option B. This work will lay the ground for future research involving the development and testing of interventions for interpersonal firearm violence both by identifying potential high- leverage modifiable predictive factors, and by identifying youth most in need of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The purpose of the proposed work is to harness cutting-edge machine learning methods to optimize prediction of future firearm violence so that prevention resources can be allocated efficiently. In service to that goal, we will recruit participants age 18-24 from three urban emergency departments, administer a comprehensive assessment, and use the measurements taken there to predict firearm violence over the following year. The proposed work will provide generalizable knowledge on what factors are most predictive of future firearm violence, which will contribute to future intervention strategies both in terms of content and in terms of optimally determining which people require intervention.",Multi-site External Validation and Improvement of a Clinical Screening Tool for Future Firearm Violence,10162695,R01CE003294,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,649991,641965656,0.001398294697649799
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,7903567,0.017839785960383443
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,89938253,-0.006729463964750629
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9812223,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,687420,570146095,0.0659103348981638
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9889183,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,698402,43632870,0.01639151659025088
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,9920211,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,709525,593605914,0.016731306200951725
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,44711126,0.04094001712120341
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9901631,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,720691,570146095,0.004896210561452601
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9910447,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,721582,570146095,0.003971770778225333
"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators. Our research will thereby provide new insights into disease, and well enable the more effective targeting of therapy to those who will most benefit at the appropriate time.",Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder,9943508,R01MH122569,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Far East', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'long short term memory', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'psychogenetics', 'public health priorities', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,733478,673201228,-0.004577420068527522
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9850289,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,735296,338121506,0.042309443840432163
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,10023944,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,740401,593605914,0.03827117986985791
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,9939094,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,746678,44711126,0.03254491360478699
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,9965404,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2020,760581,44711126,0.03431944571053856
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,9978131,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,787558,593605914,0.021626482632433695
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,593605914,0.02485444215651861
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning.

"Imaging the neurodevelopmental trajectory of depression and anxiety disorders with HCP protocols Project summary: The main objectives of this project are to perform longitudinal collection of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data from a cohort of adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls; and to develop a set of analytical tools that can be used to study the developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in this population. The project builds on the ongoing collaboration of our team in a Connectomes Related to Human Disease U01 project, the Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA) study, where we have been performing extensive clinical characterization and MRI scanning with Human Connectome Project (HCP) protocols on adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls. These baseline data (current total: N=170; final target: N=225) are set to become available publicly through the HCP database. Here we propose to collect longitudinal data on this unique, thoroughly characterized cohort. Following up on these subjects will allow us to investigate the complex relationship between longitudinal changes in neural circuitry and the onset, persistence, or recurrence of depression and anxiety disorders. We will tackle this by bringing together an investigative team with strong expertise in adolescent mood disorders and in neuroimaging data analysis. The MPIs have extensive experience in developing publicly available software tools for the analysis of brain connections from diffusion MRI (Yendiki) and functional MRI (Whitfield-Gabrieli). In this project, we propose to develop robust, automated tools for segmenting deep-brain structures and white-matter pathways that are of interest in psychiatric disorders. This development will build on our prior work in unbiased methods for longitudinal morphometric and tractography analyses. We will leverage the proposed longitudinal dataset and tools for accurate delineation of individual anatomy to perform a number of novel analyses that will go beyond conventional group-wise comparisons. Specifically, we will focus on analyses that allow us to predict clinical outcomes in individual subjects based on their neural circuitry. We will use machine-learning techniques to map the normative developmental trajectory of brain structure and function in healthy adolescents, including our controls and those from the development HCP. We will then investigate how and when the trajectories of individual adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders deviate from this normative trajectory. The longitudinal data set that we will collect and the software tools that we will develop will be shared with the research community. Our analysis methods will be applicable beyond this cohort, and could be used to study disease mechanisms and predict outcomes in a wide range of brain-related disorders across the human lifespan. Project narrative: This project will follow up on a cohort of adolescents with depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls to collect clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging data over time. Depression and anxiety disorders diagnosed during adolescence predict negative long-term consequences in adulthood.

In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9979970,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,1261241,570146095,0.03696688769341103
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,113554200,0.044573310300726456
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,11430998,0.019111777561444842
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,161094826,-0.008582447874862177
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86953,44711126,0.04094001712120341
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9674530,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2019,128483,673201228,0.029142986877615677
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,533302350,-0.006488838141497112
"Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Children and adolescents often grow up in the face of substantial developmental stress (i.e. trauma). While for some, this shifts the developmental trajectory to that of mental and general health disorders, others are resilient. Most research on developmental psychopathology is focused on risk while little is known on the mechanisms that confer resilience. The current study aims to identify biological (genomic, immune), psychological and cognitive mechanisms that underpin resilience in youth as defined by having low mood- anxiety and suicidal outcomes in youth with substantial developmental stress exposure (i.e. trauma and family history of depression). Elucidating resilience mechanisms has huge clinical implications as it will improve stratification of risk to develop depression and/or suicidal behavior, and could identify biological, psychological and cognitive targets that can inform development of future preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience, reducing the mental and general health adverse outcomes associated with childhood adversity. The study capitalizes on a large dataset of genotyped youths from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), that have been comprehensively phenotyped for cognitive performance and psychopathology, and that reported substantial trauma exposure. The proposed research integrates genomic and cognitive data with clinical measures used to define resilience in cross sectional analysis of ~9500 PNC youths (Aim 1); incorporates longitudinal data of depression and suicide measures, pulled from electronic medical record in a subset of ~750 PNC youths (Aim 2); and relies on prospective data collection that includes immune profiling of selected PNC individuals to allow identification of immune signature of resilience (Aim 3). Integration of genomic with clinical, cognitive and immune data will allow predictive modeling, and Big Data driven analysis will allow identification of resilience mechanisms. The candidate is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist physician scientist who is committed to translational research in youth at risk for psychiatric conditions. His overarching career goal is to develop methods for early identification of subclinical phenotypes before the onset of major psychiatric disorders (i.e. depression and suicide attempts) and, through neuroscience informed interventions, divert the developmental trajectory from that of risk to that of resilience. The career development plan capitalizes on a multidisciplinary mentorship team. It involves one-on one mentoring with the primary “clinical research” mentor as well as the genomic, biostatistical, neurocognitive and immune system expert co- mentors, integrated with hands on research supervision in data collection and statistical analysis, and didactic coursework and workshops. The program is tailored to meet research and training aims. The project will be conducted in the fostering environment of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, that will provide the academic mentorship and the required resources to execute the research and training aims, allowing the candidate to launch an independent research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood adversities impose risk to general and mental health development, including youth depression and suicidal behavior, still most children are resilient. Through integration of genetic, clinical, cognitive and demographic data from research data and medical records, this study will identify mechanisms that underpin resilience in a generalizable large sample of community youth with substantial exposure to adversity. Understanding resilience mechanisms is a critical milestone on the mission to develop neuroscience informed preventive interventions aimed at promoting resilience and reducing the health burden of early life adversity.",Mechanisms of resilience to developmental stress in children and adolescents.,9806213,K23MH120437,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Differences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'Suicide attempt', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Victimization', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'child depression', 'childhood adversity', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'hands on research', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'research clinical testing', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'stress related disorder', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2019,193644,178185562,0.01901858895778233
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life.

"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0,0.02986733304009458
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,929426,0.013044618047174557
"Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space Project Summary The human brain tracks multiplexed signals during social interactions. The breakdown of any of these computations could lead to social deficits observed in many psychiatric disorders. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models. Importantly, previous social neuroscience research generally assumes that the structure of social environments are stochastic and social agents act in a reactive way, leaving at least two knowledge gaps in the literature: 1) the proactive nature of social agents and 2) the dynamic and multidimensional feature of social space. The overarching aim of this project is to develop novel computational models and paradigms to capture social controllability and social navigation in ‘unselected’ human participants (laboratory study n=100, mobile app n=10,000), which can ultimately be used to capture social failures across disorders. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel generative model and paradigm for social controllability, based on a rich literature on model-based decision-making and our previous work on social learning. Key subject-level parameters include: simulated controllability (delta), future thinking weight (i.e. weight put on planning future interactions), and learning rate (epsilon). In Aim 2, we will delineate navigational computations of dynamic social relationships using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual characters, we will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning to 1) deep phenotype participants along the dimensions of social controllability and navigation and 2) predict clinical and subclinical symptoms among a large sample of ‘unfiltered’ volunteers. Upon successful completion of these aims, this proof-of-concept project will provide important validation for new computational frameworks for social controllability and social navigation, potentially breaking new grounds for computational psychiatry research of social dysfunction. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of clinical disorders including psychotic, mood, and personality disorders. Furthermore, the proposed paradigms can be back-translatable to animal models, in relation to the social defeat model of depression and other animal models of social behaviors. Thus, the proposed computational framework could have far-reaching influences that would exceed the specific focus on social control and social space navigation, advancing the possibility to advance mechanistic understanding of and develop individualized diagnosis and treatments across multiple psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Deficits in social interaction are common across many psychiatric disorders. However, many aspects of the social brain are not yet well understood, hindering our understanding of why many patients have social dysfunction and how to repair these deficits. The goal of this study is to develop detailed, objective, and implicit measurements of social functions that can be easily applied to patient populations as well as animal experiments.",Delineating proactive social behaviors in dynamic and multidimensional social space,9827207,R21MH120789,"['Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Illusions', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality Disorders', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Change', 'Social Controls', 'Social Distance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'computer framework', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social defeat', 'social deficits', 'social learning', 'social neuroscience', 'social space', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R21,2019,254250,415711940,0.001212606523211247
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop a tool to help diagnose and monitor movement disorders. Due to increasing and aging world population, more people are living with these disorders. As there is already a shortage of neurologists, and more specifically, movement disorder specialists that have the training to adequately diagnose and manage these disorders, there is a large number of patients that are not receiving optimal treatment. We propose to use a smartphone-based platform to assess the severity of symptoms that are common across different movement disorders in order to achieve our long-term goal. To that end, the current study proposes to tackle 4 specific aims. The first aim will be to develop a mobile application to quantify common symptoms of movement disorders. We will develop a new mobile application that will enable the quantification of symptom severity; namely rest tremor, postural tremor, intention tremor, kinetic tremor, upper-limb coordination, bradykinesia, balance, gait, and cognitive impairments. The data collected from the smartphone-embedded sensors will be transmitted to a secure server where data can be visualized and analyzed. The second aim will be to collect data using the mobile application from healthy individuals as well as individuals with different movement disorders. We will collect data from 30 healthy controls, 30 individuals with Essential tremor (ET), 30 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), 30 individuals with Huntington's disease (HD), 30 individuals with primary focal dystonia (PFD) of the upper-limb, 30 individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA, and 30 individuals with functional movement disorder (FMD). This dataset will enable us to develop algorithms (Aim 3) that will be used to assess symptom severity and differentiate the movement disorders according to the smartphone data. The third aim will be to develop algorithms to estimate symptom severity and distinguish the different movement disorders from one another. Using the data from the smartphone-embedded sensors, we will utilize machine learning approaches to estimate symptom severity (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, gait impairment, etc.). Then, based on the symptom severity estimation as well as from features extracted from the sensor data, we will classify the subjects in groups according to their clinical diagnosis. This will enable us to differentiate the selected movement disorders. Finally, the fourth aim will be to assess the usability of the smartphone platform for long-term monitoring of patients. Subjects of patients recruited for Aim 2 will be asked to use the smartphone application at home for 8 weeks in order to determine compliance with its use and its stability over time. This study will provide a novel tool to assess motor and non-motor symptoms that could be used in other areas of research. It will provide a large database of movement, cognitive, demographic, and medical history data of individuals with different movement disorders. Most importantly, it will help in the differentiation and monitoring of movement disorders to improve the clinical management of individuals with these disorders. The prevalence of movement disorders is on the rise due to the expanding and aging world population while there is a lack of trained specialists in, and especially outside, of developed urban centers to adequately diagnose and manage those individuals. We propose that the ubiquity of smartphones could be leveraged to help non- specialists in the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of movement disorders that often exhibit overlapping symptoms such as Essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary focal dystonia, spinocerebllar ataxia, and functional movement disorders. We will develop a smartphone application that will collect data during different tasks to help differentiate these disorders and monitor them over time.",Using Wearable and Mobile Data to Diagnose and Monitor Movement Disorders,9655625,R15NS109741,"['Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Bradykinesia', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dystonia', 'Economics', 'Equilibrium', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Gait', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention Tremor', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical History', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Dystonias', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Rest Tremor', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tremor', 'Upper Extremity', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'common symptom', 'equilibration disorder', 'functional disability', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motor symptom', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'progressive neurodegeneration', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smartphone Application', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'usability', 'wearable device']",NINDS,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R15,2019,399532,574179,0.008118854265990424
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9725782,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,446742,641965656,0.014401139953494601
"Advancing the Measurement and Classification of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients’ quality of life. Prevalence of LUTS increases with age, with estimates ranging from 45-70% of U.S. adults. It is clear from the range of conditions that produce LUTS, and the failure of current therapies to ameliorate symptoms in large segments of the population that have similar LUTS, that patients with LUTS are a heterogeneous population even when their symptoms are identical or overlap. Current LUTS treatment paradigms target narrow symptom groups, largely ignoring the heterogeneity in concomitant symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians have a limited understanding on how to integrate information from self-reported symptoms, clinical exam and laboratory results, and urodynamic testing into treatment decision-making. Improving treatment outcomes for patients with LUTS will require both (1) increased understanding of LUTS symptom clusters and underlying mechanisms behind the various subtypes and (2) comprehensive, validated, and responsive measurement tools for defining treatment efficacy. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was assembled in 2012, the primary objective of which was to categorize patients with LUTS into distinct subgroups, a process known as ‘phenotyping’. The Network’s approach to defining patient subtypes was based on a probability-based consensus clustering approach using a myriad of patient data, resulting in the identification of novel LUTS-based clusters that are statistically and clinically distinct. Concurrently, the Network worked to improve the measurement of patient reports of LUTS through systematic development of a new, high-quality item bank based on qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists, urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. LURN II will build on the knowledge gained through multiple specific aims: to test and refine the original LURN clustering model in a new cohort including a wider range of symptom severity and a wider range of physical measures (n=1380 participants followed for 3 years); to identify a signature of proteins contained within plasma that can be used to identify specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS; to determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components of the lower urinary tract; to validate a self-reported outcome tool for evaluating treatments, based on the comprehensive tool developed for phenotyping in LURN I; and to explore promising alternative analytic approaches to existing and future LURN data and characterize the broader experiences of patients with LUTS. This proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of urologists, urogynecologists, bladder physiologists, data scientists, epidemiologists, and outcomes researchers. The proposed work has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9760006,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,501996,340417756,0.017598774255324662
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,551214295,0.05014649312229951
"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,9681505,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2019,584268,44711126,0.06577243336706053
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,507546965,0.00947628864992941
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,9840077,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,621348,227555357,0.01644086362737255
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,7903567,0.017839785960383443
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,9739933,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,682250,45341731,0.026629273666662852
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9614335,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,684196,570146095,0.0659103348981638
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9743863,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,720889,570146095,0.003971770778225333
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9716663,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,723673,570146095,0.004896210561452601
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,338121506,0.042309443840432163
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9755521,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,740241,44711126,0.04094001712120341
"Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome Project Summary: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, including psychosis with similar symptoms to individuals with idiopathic schizophrenia (SZ), and about 1-2% of cases of idiopathic SZ have 22q11.2 deletions. Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (MPAs) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. MPAs include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (TD) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DS- and use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (PS). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in neural development lead to dysfunction during youth and produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the conceptualization of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Olfactory and facial markers of developmental risk for psychosis in 22q11 deletion syndrome,9885029,R01MH119185,"['22q11.2', '3-Dimensional', 'Acoustic Rhinometry', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ear', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Geometry', 'Head', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mandible', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nasal cavity', 'Neurobiology', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Cortex', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Oral cavity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Smell Perception', 'Societies', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdeletion', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropathology', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory sulcus', 'precision medicine', 'psychotic symptoms', 'resilience', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,746845,593605914,0.03827117986985791
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,9935464,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,823331,43632870,0.01639151659025088
"Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, and approximately 30% of MDD patients are resistant to conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an FDA-cleared intervention with proven efficacy in treatment-resistant depression, but only 30–40% of these patients achieve remission after a single course. Other studies have shown that rTMS targeting the dorsomedial PFC (DMPFC) is comparably effective, but biomarkers for informing target site selection and predicting differential treatment response are not currently available. Diagnostic heterogeneity has been a major obstacle to biomarker discovery efforts. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to diagnosing four novel MDD subtypes or “biotypes” defined by distinct resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in Valence System circuits and predicting differing antidepressant responses at the individual level to rTMS targeting the DMPFC. This confirmatory efficacy trial will test a novel, biotype-guided treatment selection strategy motivated by the hypothesis that an individual patient's likelihood of responding to left DLFPC vs. DMPFC rTMS is determined in part by individual differences in 1) the degree to which their symptoms are driven by dysfunction in specific downstream amygdala, striatal, and salience network targets comprising aspects of Valence Systems; and 2) the degree to which dysfunction in those targets can be modulated by stimulating the left DLPFC or DMPFC. Subjects (N=405) will be randomized to receive a) biotype-guided 10 Hz rTMS targeting the DMPFC or left DLPFC; b) to a disconfirmation arm receiving rTMS targeting the opposite site; and c) to a third arm receiving FDA-cleared, standard-of-care 10 HZ rTMS targeting the left DLFPC, regardless of biotype. All patients will be tested before and after treatment on a battery of fMRI, behavioral, and clinical assessments, grounded in RDoC-informed measures of emotion regulation and effort valuation, which will enable us to validate downstream brain circuit treatment targets and test for target engagement, in conjunction with state-of-the-art, anatomically realistic electric field modeling and fiber tractography. The primary goal is to confirm the efficacy of a novel RSFC biomarker-guided approach to differential treatment selection in treatment resistant depression, with the potential for significantly enhanced efficacy compared to the current standard-of-care. Depression is the second leading cause of disability worldwide, due partly to the fact that existing antidepressants are not effective for all patients and it is often challenging to match individual patients to the treatments that are most likely to help them. This project will test a new strategy for using fMRI brain scans to predict antidepressant response and assist clinicians in choosing which of two antidepressant treatments— transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting one of two depression-related brain areas—is most likely to benefit an individual patient.",Efficacy of biomarker-guided rTMS for treatment resistant depression,9648914,R01MH118388,"['Accounting', 'Aftercare', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anhedonia', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease remission', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Work', 'anxious', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical predictors', 'comparative efficacy', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy trial', 'electric field', 'emotion regulation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tractography', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,1245371,227555357,0.021163702338321582
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9697234,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'circadian', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social deficits', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,1273593,570146095,0.03696688769341103
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9534942,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,36594,11430998,0.019111777561444842
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,113554200,0.044573310300726456
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,161094826,-0.008582447874862177
"Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using genetic and phenotypic signatures,9505794,K99MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive signature', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2018,128072,673201228,0.029142986877615677
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,304670088,-0.02130544091514258
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9540056,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,333874,164685352,0.05160242277754732
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9520444,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347813,607172798,0.014265564063639895
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,68331629,0.039060182054540336
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9501776,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,483815,641965656,0.014401139953494601
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9612862,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,547853,340417756,0.017598774255324662
"Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression Major depressive disorder is highly prevalent, and represents a major driver of disability as well as health care cost. Progress in improving diagnosis and treatment of this disorder has been hindered by its heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Such heterogeneity makes the underlying neurobiology difficult to characterize, and has led to efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups. These efforts date back to the dawn of the modern psychopharmacologic era - initially focused on atypical and melancholic depression, and more recently on subtypes such as anxious and irritable depression.  Subtyping efforts are complicated by a paucity of large clinical cohorts with similar ascertainment and phenotyping. In particular, the available data often focuses on a very narrow range of depressive symptoms, along with a restricted set of comorbidities, and typically encompasses only the acute phase of treatment. As a result, despite intriguing findings in one or occasionally two cohorts, subtyping has not been widely deployed in clinical practice, nor used to meaningfully improve translational investigation.  The utility of electronic health records and registries to create in silico cohort studies has been demonstrated in numerous settings, including psychiatry. Beyond sample size and efficiency of ascertainment, these data types often have advantages in the range of non-depressive phenotypes captured and availability of longitudinal data.  The present study therefore proposes to create a very large cohort of individuals with MDD, defined by a validated algorithm, spanning two health systems, and to apply novel machine learning methods to identify MDD subtypes. These subtypes will be validated by comparison with standard phenotypic definitions, annotation by trained raters using a standard 'intruder' paradigm, and correlation with medication prescribing Then, as proof of concept the biological basis of these subtypes will be characterized by examining heritability and polygenic risk using a large genetic biobank. Beyond determining convergent validity, this last step will provide proof-of-concept for broader application of data-driven subtypes for translational investigation in biobanks and registries.  The study builds on existing collaborations between a team experienced in mood disorder phenotypic and genomic study as well as application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing and applying emerging methods in machine learning. It will lay the groundwork for further validation and application of data-driven disease subtyping across medicine. Public health significance The wide variation in symptoms of major depressive disorder complicates efforts to understand the underlying causes of this illness. Applying machine learning methods to electronic health records should enable the identification of more specific disease subgroups. These subgroups will facilitate efforts to understand the causes of depression, and to begin to develop more targeted treatments.",Machine learning for data-driven subtyping of major depression,9717620,R56MH115187,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Atypical depressive disorder', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endocrine System Diseases', 'European', 'Face', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Melancholic Depression', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reactive depression', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'psychopharmacologic', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R56,2018,595755,551214295,0.023092383891808878
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,7903567,0.017839785960383443
"Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety Project Summary / Abstract Biomarkers have transformed the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions. In contrast, psychiatric biomarkers remain largely elusive, due in part to the fact that there is a weak correspondence between psychiatric diagnoses and their neurobiological substrates. This is especially true for depression and anxiety disorders, clinically heterogeneous conditions associated with abnormal reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli—and to the cues that predict them—and varied patterns of dysfunction in neural circuits that process positive and negative valence. This project will investigate how arousal processes interact with VS circuits to influence the anticipation and experience of rewarding and aversive stimuli in patients seeking treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety, independent of conventional diagnostic categories. It is specifically designed to advance the goals of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project, by focusing on four related RDoC constructs that are directly germane to this question—arousal, potential threat threat, approach motivation, and reward attainment—and testing whether they explain variation in symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia in clinical populations. Importantly, this project will also advance RDoC's goal of developing new ways of classifying mental disorders, which will ultimately require methods for identifying novel diagnostic classes linked to homogeneous pathophysiology. To this end, we will test a strategy for discovering novel diagnostic subtypes defined by clustered patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in valence system circuits. We will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to develop classifiers for diagnosing these subtypes in individual patients, and we will seek to identify distinct mechanisms by which atypical valence system reactivity may contribute to anxiety, anhedonia, and abnormal approach motivation and avoidance behavior in distinct patient subgroups, indexed in the laboratory via integrated, convergent measurements across multiple units of analysis. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and targeting treatments to the patients most likely to benefit from them. In contrast, biomarkers for psychiatric disorders remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of depression and anxiety in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific clinical profiles of anxiety, reward processing, and anxious arousal within these subtypes.",Diagnostic Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Dysfunctional Valence Systems in Depression and Anxiety,9733429,R56MH114976,"['Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stimulus', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Variant', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'approach avoidance behavior', 'avoidance behavior', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer therapy', 'connectome', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experience', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'negative affect', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'reward processing', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R56,2018,724068,227555357,0.02367676367960837
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9444775,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,735735,570146095,0.0659103348981638
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,44711126,0.04094001712120341
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",9593921,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,797747,570146095,0.003971770778225333
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,9543193,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,798597,570146095,0.004896210561452601
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9487760,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,1272933,570146095,0.03696688769341103
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,560644462,0.03789026912374344
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9396350,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,35844,11430998,0.019111777561444842
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,113554200,0.044573310300726456
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9357677,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'multimodality', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2017,76750,2132449,-0.010302569892357493
"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9328159,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal behavior', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2017,139359,44711126,0.04436450271709248
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9321191,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,165886,329565273,0.029980347493294496
"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,304670088,-0.02130544091514258
"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?""

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9309288,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,319091,164685352,0.05160242277754732
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9325617,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'mechanical force', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,347813,607172798,0.014265564063639895
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,68331629,0.039060182054540336
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9296185,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,572607,641965656,0.014401139953494601
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,7903567,0.017839785960383443
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9329487,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,1254231,570146095,0.03696688769341103
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,338121506,0.014353702620938961
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,560644462,0.03789026912374344
"Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD The identification of neurobiological markers associated with childhood status and persistence vs. remission of the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) over development, and the translation of these markers into more effective diagnosis and intervention strategies are major priorities of NIMH. The persistence of ADHD into adulthood in many but not all afflicted children attests to the considerable variability in the remission of symptoms over development. However, evidence of cortical and subcortical structural anomalies associated with the persistence versus remission of ADHD is relatively limited, and not fully consistent. [Our group is in a unique position to test the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the childhood status and the developmental trajectories of ADHD]. We recently completed a 15-year longitudinal study of ADHD that recruited and clinically followed a large sample of children with ADHD into adulthood, as well as a well- matched sample of never ADHD controls that was recruited in adolescence and followed into adulthood. This large sample represents the diversity of outcomes characteristic of ADHD and was scanned with multi-modal neuroimaging in adulthood. Published results of our functional neuroimaging study support the distinction in neural mechanisms associated with the emergence and remission of ADHD. Young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood were marked by reduced regardless of adult outcome, while the remission of ADHD symptoms in adulthood was associated with enhanced cue-related thalamo-prefrontal functional connectivity. [However, the neuroanatomical evidence of this double-dissociation model of ADHD emergence and remission has not yet been investigated cue-related thalamus activation and functional connectivity with brainstem . By capitalizing on the availability of both neuroimaging and longitudinal clinical data from our recently completed study and utilizing advanced neuroimaging analysis and multivariate machine leaning techniques, this proposal aims to identify the neuroanatomical correlates of childhood status and remission of ADHD in young adults, and to link the anatomical evidence with the functional and longitudinal clinical evidence associated with persistent vs. remitted ADHD. The ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into clinically applicable biomarkers that can guide individualized interventions in youth with ADHD.] Our central hypotheses are that: (1) childhood ADHD is associated with thalamo-brainstem structural disconnectivity that endures into adulthood regardless of the developmental trajectory of the disorder; and (2) diminution of symptoms is related to optimal prefrontal development and its anatomical connectivity with other brain regions. The ultimate goal of this proposal is innovative and directly relevant to the NIMH mission, to translate hypothesis-driven neuroanatomical correlates of adult outcome into more clinically applicable biomarkers that can serve as targets for the development of interventions in youth with ADHD. NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent within the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with the persistence vs. remission of ADHD. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for persistent and remitted ADHD, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to improved option for prevention and intervention targets.",Neuroanatomical markers of persistence versus remission of ADHD,9242756,R03MH109791,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Anisotropy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dissociation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'clinically relevant', 'disorder control', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'feeding', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'model development', 'myelination', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'proband', 'therapy development', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R03,2016,76750,2132449,-0.010302569892357493
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9123674,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2016,165886,329565273,0.029980347493294496

"Building Multistage Treatment Regimens for Depression after Acute Coronary SyndromeSyndrome Building Multistage Treatment Policy for Depression after Acute Coronary Syndrome Project Summary Depression is not only commonly observed among patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but also has been shown to increase risks for recurrent ACS and mortality. Despite its high prevalence and serious impact, management of post-ACS depression remains poor because of ineciencies in depression screen- ing, limited treatment options of depression after ACS, and lack of e ective procedure if initial treatment fails. To address these issues, clinical researchers have tried to develop personalized stepped care procedures for post-ACS depression patients; this involves o ering patients the choice of receiving psychotherapy and/or antidepressant treatment and adjusting treatment as needed. The treatment decisions are usually based on patient demographics, treatment preference, medical history, progress of disease, and comorbid conditions. With the development of modern technologies, the number of available treatments increases, and more pa- tient information are collected in clinical research. Thus excavating useful information for treatment decisions is becoming more challenging. In this project, we propose to develop a principled way to construct simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional data, that can be used to guide treatment selection throughout the course of the disease. Aim 1 of the project is devoted to the development of vari- able selection methodology for constructing multistage treatment policies using statistical machine learning techniques. The proposed research seeks to incorporate the popular variable selection technique (LASSO) into existing treatment policy search approaches, namely Q-learning and A-Learning, for developing optimal treatment policies and for identifying patient response status to initial treatment { an important factor for tailoring treatment in the subsequent stages. Aim 2 evaluates the proposed methods, applies the methods to post-ACS depression data, and addresses some computational challenges. Statistical research in this area has been focused on the development of evidence-based treatment policies using pre-chosen models and variables; few if any discuss how to select models or variables in a principled way. The proposed work aims to ll this gap in methodology using modern machine learning techniques. Project Narratives The proposed research aims to answer the following question:\How to excavate simple interpretable multistage treatment policies from high-dimensional, longitudinal medical data in a principled way?""

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder As many as 53% of students report experiencing depression during college, and these depressive episodes are associated with a higher frequency of academic problems, comorbidity, and suicide. Although there are effective options for treatment, the majority of individuals (>70%) do not pursue services, and even for those who do, response rates remain modest (~40-50%). As a means of increasing accessibility to treatment, internet-based interventions for depression have been developed and tested. Despite increased availability, response to internet-based interventions continues to vary substantially, and failed treatment often contributes to persistence and worsening of symptoms. Therefore, identifying individuals with a high likelihood of responding to internet-based treatment would represent a major advance and address a critical unmet need.  In recent years, promising approaches for testing the heterogeneity of the treatment effects – delineating which individuals are likely to respond to a given treatment – have been developed. However, their use for identifying predictors of treatment response in depression remains unclear. To address this unmet need, the proposed study will test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response following internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression in a large, representative college sample (Boston Consortium of Colleges and Universities which includes 7 schools). Members of the consortium have committed to screening all incoming freshmen (N = ~14,000) through a rigorous online assessment and to offer iCBT to students with elevated levels of depressive symptoms (i.e., minor or major depression). The following steps will be pursued. First, in the initial phase of the study, freshmen students from the Boston Consortium will be screened for depression through an online survey, and they also will complete web-based neurocognitive tasks probing key mechanisms underpinning depression. Depressed students will be invited to enroll in iCBT, and a predictive algorithm will be developed based on assessments across different units of analysis (i.e., clinical characteristics, neurocognitive indices) to identify iCBT responders. Second, after the development phase, an independent sample of college students will be recruited to validate the predictive algorithm. This validation phase will use clinical indicators and neurocognitive data. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data targeting key mechanisms within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) will be acquired from a subset of participants. Neural data will be integrated to determine whether they improve the predictive algorithm. Third, data across independent samples will be combined, which will increase power to refine our predictive model for both acute and sustained response. In summary, there are alarming rates of depression among college students, and only a minority of students utilize mental health services. The proposed research will personalize our approach to depression treatment, which, ultimately, will improve effectiveness and better inform mental health care across college campuses. Depression is common, recurrent, and debilitating among college students, and the majority of depressed individuals (>70%) do not pursue treatment. Internet-based interventions are effective, low-cost, and easily disseminated, and the goal of this project is to test a new, cost-effective, and feasibly-scaled method of predicting differential treatment response to an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) for depression. This innovative approach - which relies on an integration of data across units of analysis (e.g., self- report, neurocognitive, and neural data) – promises to optimize treatment outcomes for depression, and therefore, reduce associated negative consequences including academic problems, risky behavior engagement, and suicidality.",Predicting Internet-Based Treatment Response for Major Depressive Disorder,9314157,R56MH109566,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Students', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'college', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data integration', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'minor depressive disorder', 'minority student', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuromechanism', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'reward expectancy', 'screening', 'suicidal', 'support tools', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R56,2016,364740,44711126,0.04436450271709248
"Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia Project Summary ""Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention in Schizophrenia”  Schizophrenia is one of the most debilitating disorders in the world today. It affects over 2.4 million adult Americans each year. NIMH director Dr. Thomas Insel has declared “The best chance for preventing serious functional disability among people with schizophrenia may be to intervene at the earliest stages of the disorder, at the first episode of psychosis or even before symptoms appear. However, to act before symptoms appear requires improved predictive capacity” (NIMH 2011 Budget). Creating tools to identify high-risk, `prodromal' individuals may be the single most important step towards developing effective interventions to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), and thereby also reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown that over 54% of individuals with schizophrenia are re-hospitalized within the first 12 months following their initial hospitalization. Even after the first hospitalization, preventing relapse and re-hospitalization may lessen the long-term severity of the illness. In this SBIR Phase I study, we propose to determine the feasibility of screening for prodromal individuals and individuals at high risk of relapse by applying interpretive algorithms to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD). We hypothesize that PGMSD can effectively assist in screening for prodromal individuals who are progressing toward psychosis as well as for remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP).  In Phase I, we plan to recruit 70 individuals who have been or are being evaluated at the Prodromal clinics at Columbia, UCSD, and UCLA, where an estimated 70 to 90% of clients already own Smartphones. Data gathered may include: the frequency of telephone calls, emails, and texts, to assess within person changes in social connectedness; GPS, accelerometer data, to assess physical activity, isolation, and sleep patterns. In the past, several IRB-approved studies have used smartphones for gathering similar data from patients. Algorithms will be developed using several techniques including machine learning to convert the meta-level data into measures of social functioning, physical isolation, physical activity, and sleep/wake reversals. In addition to achieving technological success, our goal in Phase I is to provide evidence of our ability to use PGMSD algorithms to differentiating group means of participants who are controls, prodromal, or experiencing their FEP (SIPS 1 or 2; 3, 4, or 5; or 6).  In Phase II, we will further develop and validate these algorithms. If successful, the Phase II project will have a large and sustained impact as our algorithms will help (1) identify at-risk individuals who `are' or `are not' progressing toward conversion, (2) serve as an objective measure of treatment effectiveness; (3) give rise to clinical reports delivered to EHR systems that hold promise for preventing relapse during the critical 12 months after initial diagnosis, potentially reducing hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. Project Narrative The proposed research protocol seeks to determine the feasibility of identifying individuals progressing toward a first psychotic episode or re-hospitalization by applying interpretive algorithms developed in part using machine learning to Passively Gathered Meta-level Smartphone Data (PGMSD) collected from the smartphones of 70 participants ages 18-30. If successful, the PGMSD-derived algorithms will assist in screening for prodromal individuals progressing toward psychosis as well as with remotely assessing individuals at risk for relapse during the critical 12-month period following their first episode of psychosis (FEP), potentially decrease hospitalization and re-hospitalization rates. This passive data gathering approach will augment existing active data collection approaches, aid clinicians in focusing on interpreting rather than gathering data from their clients, and could modify clinical paradigms by shifting treatment from individuals suffering from Schizophrenia to individuals who are at risk of developing psychosis with the goal of achieving `secondary' and eventually `primary' prevention.",Using Meta-level Smartphone Data to Promote Early Intervention inSchizophrenia,9201713,R43MH107097,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Incipient Schizophrenia', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Poverty', 'Primary Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Universities', 'Work', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'first episode psychosis', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'information gathering', 'insight', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'prevent', 'programs', 'real world application', 'relapse risk', 'screening', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,"TELESAGE, INC.",R43,2016,366201,0,0.02945944759582419
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,68331629,0.039060182054540336
"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,9109682,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Health', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'research study', 'specific biomarkers', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,454953,641965656,0.014401139953494601
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will determine whether treating depression during pregnancy would reduce the risk or severity of postparturm depression, and, if so, which treatment option (psychotherapy or antidepressants) is more effective in reducing postpartum depression.",Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression,9124715,R01HS021515,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,499814,111231681,0.042450240377853006
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,7903567,0.017839785960383443
"Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal of the ""Bipolar Offspring Study"" (BIOS; NIMH #60952). In line with the current NIMH Strategic Plan, BIOS has been investigating the additive effects of dimensional/categorical psychopathology, circadian/sleep, cognitive, environmental, and biological factors associated with the development of mood disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (BD). BIOS recruited 509 offspring from BD parents (OBP) and 353 Offspring from Control Parents (OCP) and interviewed them blind to parental diagnoses with a comprehensive battery of instruments every other year since 2001, with 92% retention. Also, in a subsample of offspring, neuroimaging tests were performed. During the next funding period, most of the sample will be entering adulthood, a time when mood disorders peak, important life changes occur (e.g., marriage, work, children), and prefrontal systems reach final stages of development. We therefore propose to continue to study the BIOS sample to identify the clinical and psychosocial trajectories from childhood into adulthood, how these trajectories change during adulthood, and the prodromal symptoms of BD. In addition, in a BIOS subsample we aim to continue to identify RDoC domain-related biomarkers of neurodevelopmental trajectories underlying positive and negative emotion processing, reward, attentional control of emotion during emotion regulation, and executive function, and the demographic, familial, neural circuitry, and environmental factors that are predictors of psychopathology and resilience. To do this, we propose to: 1) continue following the entire BIOS sample; 2) perform a second scan and neurocognitive tests for the subsamples of OBP without BD (n=35) and OCP (n=35) with prior neuroimaging /neurocognitive data; 3) complete two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 healthy youth offspring of healthy parents; and 4) for the first time in BIOS, include two scans and neurocognitive tests in 35 OBP who developed BD. We hypothesize that distinct RDoC domain-related patterns of function and white matter structure in emotion processing, reward, and emotion regulation neural circuitries are present in OBP, and to a lesser extent, in OCP. These patterns of neural circuitry function and structure, together with environmental factors (e.g., stressors), are associated with longitudinal trajectories manifested by increased dimensional psychopathology (e.g., subsyndromal mood symptoms, mood lability, sleep problems). The presence of dimensional psychopathology then increases the risk to develop mood and other disorders (e.g., anxiety, substance abuse), and psychosocial impairment. Recurrent subsyndromal manic and depressive episodes, irritability, mood lability and/or sleep disturbances will specifically increae risk for BD. Using this framework, we propose to characterize the clinical and psychosocial functioning trajectories into adulthood and determine the specific neural circuitry and environmental factors associated with increased risk for psychopathology, especially BD, and factors associated with resilience. Such findings will facilitate prompt diagnosis and intervention thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of BD in youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe illness associated with considerable negative consequences for the normal development of the child, and increased risk for suicide and substance abuse. However, little is known about the initial symptoms and the progression of bipolar disorder from childhood to adulthood. The findings from this large study will help to identify the initial symptoms and brain biological markers related to the increased risk for developing bipolar disorder. Such findings will advance the field so that prompt diagnosis and interventions are made, thus preventing, or at least ameliorating, the negative effects of this severe and debilitating illness.            ",Children of Bipolar Parents: A High Risk Follow Up Study (also known as Bipolar Offspring Study - BIOS),9027247,R01MH060952,"['Accounting', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Figs - dietary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Marriage', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scanning', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxiety symptoms', 'associated symptom', 'attentional control', 'blind', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive testing', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional outcomes', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'instrument', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neurocognitive test', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward processing', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal risk', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,1364412,570146095,0.03696688769341103
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,338121506,0.014353702620938961
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Youth with externalizing psychopathologies, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder, present with diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms, which in turn reflect deficits in regulatory control functioning. An emerging neurodevelopmental model, which we call the Impulsivity as Immaturity Model, could potentially transform our understanding of the brain basis of regulatory dysfunction. The brain's regulatory control architecture (RCA) undergoes massive maturation during childhood and adolescence. The Impulsivity as Immaturity Model proposes that aberrant maturation in distinct components of the RCA gives rise to distinct patterns of impulsivity symptoms-e.g., delayed maturation in certain attention control components gives rise to attentional variability, a specific form of attention dysfunction. Informed by this model, we will use a mixed cohort/longitudinal design enrolling 135 healthy youth and 135 youth with externalizing psychopathologies. Using advanced multivariate/multimodal analytic methods, we will map the normative neurodevelopmental trajectories of major components of the RCA including components involved in attention, motor, emotion, and appetitive control. We will then construct multivariate models that predict different forms of impulsivity based on neurodevelopment patterns of RCA components. Successful completion of this project will be a critical first step in development of a new class of imaging-based immaturity biomarkers that index distinct types of impulsivity irrespective of the specific externalizing disorders in which they manifest. This will lead to earlier, more reliable diagnosis of impulsivity problems in youth and spur the development of transdiagnostic, biologically based interventions that target specific forms of RCA dysmaturation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Using neuroimaging, we will map the development of key components of the brain's regulatory control architecture in a sample of youth with externalizing disorders and diverse kinds of impulsivity symptoms. We will use these maps to develop a new class of neuroimaging biomarkers for specific forms of impulsivity. This research will advance the development of biologically informed dimensional approaches for characterizing complex impulsivity phenotypes and will spur the development of new treatments.                ",Impulsivity as Immaturity: Mapping Dysmaturation of the Brain's Control Architecture in Youth Externalizing Psychopathology,8956794,R01MH107741,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Youth', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease classification', 'early adolescence', 'emotion dysregulation', 'follow-up', 'independent component analysis', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mind control', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'vector', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,382086,641965656,0.014401139953494601
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.            ",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,8960792,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2015,437426,68331629,0.039060182054540336
"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD. Selecting an effective treatment could lead to a reduction in PPD which remains a leading public health challenge worldwide. The established registry could be a valuable resource for many future studies of long-term effects of depression on maternal health and children's development.

"Natural Course of Cannabis Use Disorders from Childhood Through Early Adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In many countries cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug. In the United States, adolescence and early adulthood are particularly critical periods for the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). A recent survey of high school youth, for example, indicated that more than 2 out of 5 12th grade students have used cannabis. Similarly, based on findings from a recent national survey, researchers estimated that 2.4 million U.S. residents aged 12 years or older initiated cannabis during the prior year, and that during the same 12-month period about 4.3 million residents (or 1.7% of the U.S. population) either abused or were dependent on cannabis. Despite the importance of CUDs as a public health concern, important gaps in knowledge remain concerning the development and course of CUDs in the general population. To address these gaps, the proposed research will document several important features associated with the natural course of CUDs. To accomplish these research aims, an existing data set from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project (OADP) will be analyzed. The OADP is a community-based and multi- generational longitudinal study that spans the peak period for the emergence of sustained patterns of hazardous cannabis use, from adolescence through early adulthood.  The research described in this application will address several cannabis-related topics not previously addressed in prior OADP publications. Five broad areas are emphasized that integrate OADP's longitudinal and developmental features. (1) The prevalence of CUDs in the OADP sample will be reported, and hazards functions that describe the time to recovery from the initial CUDs episode, the probability of relapse, and the time to disorder recurrence will also be provided. (2) Subgroups of persons will be identified based on the developmental course of CUDs over the lifetime, and childhood risk factors and adult psychosocial outcomes associated with distinct trajectory subgroups will be reported. (3) The parental transmission of CUD risk will be evaluated and documented. (4) Childhood and adolescent psychiatric risk factors for later CUDs will be evaluated with proportional hazards functions and logistic regression approaches. (5) Proportional hazards modeling and logistic regression approaches will be used to evaluate the psychiatric outcomes of CUD episodes. Findings from this proposed research have the potential to inform theories of the epidemiology of CUDs, aid the development of screening tools to identify youth who are at risk for future CUDs, facilitate the development of targeted prevention programs and therapeutic interventions, and reduce the likelihood of relapse once beneficial behavior change has occurred.        The proposed research is consistent with two strategic goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). (1) To prevent the initiation of cannabis use and the development of cannabis use disorders (CUDs) by identifying patterns of abuse and associated psychosocial risk factors, including family factors. (2) To evaluate the potential influence of other psychiatric disorders in the development of CUDs.

"Effectiveness of Treating Prenatal Depression to Reduce Postpartum Depression     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum depression (PPD) afflicts about 10-15% of pregnant women. Depression during pregnancy is the strongest risk factor for PPD. However, currently, significant confusion exists about whether treating depression during pregnancy could reduce the risk of PPD. Our preliminary studies suggest that treating prenatal depression may reduce PPD risk. To further determine (1) if prenatal depression itself increases the risk of PPD, thus should be treated, (2) if treatment is beneficial, and (3) which treatment is most effective i reducing PPD, we propose to conduct a two-stage prospective cohort study in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). KPNC has implemented a unique universal peripartum depression screening program. All pregnant women (about 33,000 annually) are screened for depression twice during pregnancy and once postpartum using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). During the study period, 120,000 pregnant women who are screened for depression will be included in a peripartum depression screening registry. Using the information on depression status and treatment choices from all 120,000 women (stage-one sample), five cohorts will be formed: (A) ""Untreated cohort"": those who screen positive for depression during pregnancy, but do not receive treatment; (B) "" Psychotherapy cohort"": screen positive and receive psychotherapy only; (C) ""Antidepressant cohort"": screen positive and use antidepressants only; (D) ""Combination treatments cohort"": screen positive and use both psychotherapy and antidepressants; and (E) ""Control cohort"": screen negative for depression and do not receive any treatments. For the stage-two sub-sample, we will randomly select 400 subjects from each of the five cohorts (a total of 2,000 women) and interview them in-person to obtain detailed information on confounders and effect modifiers for adjustment. Comparison of Cohort A versus Cohort E will determine if untreated depression in pregnancy increases the risk of PPD. Comparisons of Cohorts B, C, and D to Cohort A, respectively, will determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. Pair-wise comparisons among Cohorts B, C, and D will determine the comparative effectiveness of various treatment options including psychotherapy, anti-depressants, and combination therapies. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in improving depression status from during to after pregnancy where within person change in PHQ-9 scores between prenatal and postpartum periods are compared. Logistic regression analyses will be used to examine the treatment effectiveness in reducing PPD risk where PPD risk (a dichotomized variable) is compared among all treatment groups. The findings will provide answers to pressing clinical questions of whether depression in pregnancy should be treated and, if so, which option is the best for reducing PPD.

"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and  about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is  currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of  CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-  ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are,  they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms  2) Accommodative Mechanisms  3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms  There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term,  we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions  associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase t, we propose to:  ¿Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects  and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population  ¿Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms  ¿Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations  ¿Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product using both statistical   methods and subjective questionnaires n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,8203808,R41EY015023,"['Address', 'Age', 'Asthenopia', 'Back', 'Blurred vision', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Burns', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Headache', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Neck', 'Pain', 'Phase', 'Population Control', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Shoulder', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'combat', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'eye dryness', 'improved', 'ocular surface', 'sex']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2011,47724,0,-0.027999867550757878
"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,30434536,0.04506701867923038
"Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K award will be integral in the development of Dr. Sigel's career, which is focused on youth violence detection and intervention in the primary care setting. Dr. Sigel will work with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Terence Thornberry. To become an independent researcher in this field, the candidate has identified several skill sets that need enhancement, including: improving knowledge of psychometric properties of screening tools, improving ability to conduct longitudinal, randomized control intervention trials, learning skills to evaluate program implementation, increasing understanding of what interventions work for youth violence intervention, and understanding the interface between violence as a public health problem and how the medical setting can be used to address this issue. A combination of working at the CSPV, taking didactic classes, interfacing with the community, and carrying out the proposed research project will accomplish this. Long term career goals include: 1) becoming an independent clinical investigator in the field of youth violence assessment and intervention; 2) studying and implementing evidence-based interventions at the primary care level to decrease morbidity and mortality from youth violence and 3) establishing a center of excellence in youth violence assessment and treatment, in collaboration with community partners. The research project is: Assessing Predictive Validity at 1 and 2 Years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening Tool for Primary Care. Specific Aim: Determine the predictive validity at one and two years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening (VIPRS) Tool that identifies youth at risk for future violence involvement (aggression, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and injury from violence).Methods: An initial cohort of 165 youth, and 131 parents have been enrolled to evaluate the reliability and validity of the VIPRS cross-sectionally. This proposed study will examine the future predictive validity of the VIPRS by assessing the initial cohort of youth and parents at one and two year follow-up from initial enrollment. Questionnaires evaluating aggression and victimization will be administered, as well as repeating the VIPRS. Chart review will be done at one and two year follow-up to determine whether the primary care practitioner diagnosed any behavior related to violence involvement, or any violence related injury. Analysis The predictive validity of the VIPRS will be examined using multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis to determine whether:1) the VIPRS baseline scores are associated with violent behavior occurring between baseline and the one-year and two year follow-up interview; and 2) change in VIPRS scores from baseline to one-year is associated with violent behavior occurring between the one-year follow-up interview and the two-year follow-up interviews, adjusted for baseline VIPRS scores. Project Narrative/Relevance: This project is vital to the public health issue of youth violence. Primary care health professionals have not been actively involved in treating youth violence, mostly because it is time consuming and challenging to recognize youth at risk. By creating an easy to administer screening tool, health professionals will be able to recognize, and ultimately intervene before youth suffer the consequences of violence involvement.           n/a",Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care,7681002,K01CE001332,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2009,141976,292134808,0.011922357486375292

Specific Aim: Determine the predictive validity at one and two years of the Violence Injury, Protection and Risk Screening (VIPRS) Tool that identifies youth at risk for future violence involvement (aggression, violence perpetration, violence victimization, and injury from violence).Methods: An initial cohort of 165 youth, and 131 parents have been enrolled to evaluate the reliability and validity of the VIPRS cross-sectionally. This proposed study will examine the future predictive validity of the VIPRS by assessing the initial cohort of youth and parents at one and two year follow-up from initial enrollment. Questionnaires evaluating aggression and victimization will be administered, as well as repeating the VIPRS. Chart review will be done at one and two year follow-up to determine whether the primary care practitioner diagnosed any behavior related to violence involvement, or any violence related injury. Analysis The predictive validity of the VIPRS will be examined using multivariate linear or logistic regression analysis to determine whether:1) the VIPRS baseline scores are associated with violent behavior occurring between baseline and the one-year and two year follow-up interview; and 2) change in VIPRS scores from baseline to one-year is associated with violent behavior occurring between the one-year follow-up interview and the two-year follow-up interviews, adjusted for baseline VIPRS scores. Project Narrative/Relevance: This project is vital to the public health issue of youth violence. Primary care health professionals have not been actively involved in treating youth violence, mostly because it is time consuming and challenging to recognize youth at risk. By creating an easy to administer screening tool, health professionals will be able to recognize, and ultimately intervene before youth suffer the consequences of violence involvement.           n/a",Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care,7497414,K01CE001332,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K01,2008,149201,292134808,0.011922357486375292
"SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment The phase I objective of SPIMA is to create a phone-based system that longitudinally and remotely assesses the mood of patients suffering from major depression. The ultimate objective of this SBIR is to automate the assessment of depression and deliver that automated assessment remotely over telecommunications or internet infrastructure. The value of the system is for patients and providers to have an unobtrusive way to gain greater insight into the progression of depression, and potential response to therapy. The core technology is the SPIMA index that is calculated based on performing signal processing of voice acoustics and will correlate to standard clinical depression rating scales. The phase I will begin with a first user study to give use case scenarios on the design of SPIMA and collect 150 voice samples from 30 subjects. The voice algorithms will be tested for reliability on these diverse voice samples. Through a second study of fifteen depressed patients over eight weeks, the SPIMA index will be validated. The objective of that study will be to establish the overall feasibility of SPIMA to predict a patient's mood and response to medical therapy over time. In the phase II study, SPIMA will be validated with a larger patient population through a phase IV clinical trial. It will also be applied to run off a mobile phone as a step towards more continuous mood monitoring. The project is significant as it can provide a new means to manage this chronic and debilitating disease. SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment SPIMA will make a significant impact on public health by providing a simple and elegant way to monitor depression through voice analysis. The SPIMA index will become an important longitudinal measure of a patient's mood that will be closely related to established depression rating scales. This innovation will ultimately equip the patient and care provider with information to better manage major depression.          n/a",SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment,7326946,R43MH079573,"['Acoustics', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endogenous depression', 'Evaluation', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family Practice', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Week', 'Workplace', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mecarzole', 'response']",NIMH,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2007,123893,662886,0.03056467604880081
"Assessing an Adolescent Violence Screening Tool Longitudinally for Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K award will be integral in the development of Dr. Sigel's career, which is focused on youth violence detection and intervention in the primary care setting. Dr. Sigel will work with the Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Terence Thornberry. To become an independent researcher in this field, the candidate has identified several skill sets that need enhancement, including: improving knowledge of psychometric properties of screening tools, improving ability to conduct longitudinal, randomized control intervention trials, learning skills to evaluate program implementation, increasing understanding of what interventions work for youth violence intervention, and understanding the interface between violence as a public health problem and how the medical setting can be used to address this issue. A combination of working at the CSPV, taking didactic classes, interfacing with the community, and carrying out the proposed research project will accomplish this.

"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD). The long-term research goal of this project continues to be the identification of genetics factors which predispose to the development and course of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The immediate goal of the current application is to test the discriminant validity of DSM-IV and latent class conceptualizations of ADHD subtypes on the stability, course and outcome of illness. During the initial funding period of this project we have developed an alternative DSM-IV nosology using latent class analysis. In contrast to DSM-IV ADHD subtypes, these new phenotypes appear to be genetically independent forms of ADHD. These studies utilized birth defects based identification of twins with ADHD symptomatology through a two-stage screening process.  In this current application we propose to conduct a 5- year follow-up study of 450 families identified through having a latent class or DSM-IV identified ADHD subtype. In addition to repeating the original evaluation assessment, families will also complete an enhanced set of interviews and questionnaires relating to family history, home environment and outcome measures. In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6819975,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', 'behavioral genetics', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'genetic models', 'genetic screening', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'mental health epidemiology', 'patient oriented research', 'questionnaires', 'twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,546341,533594881,0.004718790899986037
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6725468,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Trichomonas vaginalis', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'clinical research', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'female', 'gonorrhea', 'human subject', 'interview', 'reproductive system infection', 'sexually transmitted diseases', 'sign /symptom', 'urinalysis', 'urinary tract infection', 'women&apos', 's health']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2004,74500,0,0.022907507582755542
"Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) refers to a collection of eye problems associated with computer use, and about three-quarters of computer users have it. Conservative estimates indicate that over $2 billion is currently spent on examinations and special eyewear for CVS treatment. The most common symptoms of CVS include: eyestrain or eye fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, sensitivity to light, and blurred vision. Non-ocular symptoms include headaches, pain in the shoulders, neck, or back. As diverse as the symptoms are, they may be related and can be subdivided into to three potential pathophysiological causes:   1) Ocular Surface Mechanisms   2) Accommodative Mechanisms   3) Extra-Ocular Mechanisms   There is a significant gap in the fund of knowledge regarding the diagnosis of this disease. In the near-term, we plan to focus on the ocular surface category of disorders as a cause of CVS, identify clinical conditions associated with this syndrome and develop a treatment that addresses this cause. In phase 1, we propose to:   Clinically define CVS by observing the incidence of ocular surface abnormalities in symptomatic subjects and compare them with an age and sex matched non-symptomatic control population   Develop specialized micro-environment glasses to combat CVS symptoms   Study the efficacy of micro-environment glasses in symptomatic and control populations   Critically evaluate viability of CVS micro-environment glasses as a commercial product      using both statistical methods and subjective questionnaires.            n/a",Micro-environment Glasses as a Treatment for CVS,6792878,R41EY015023,"['age difference', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'eye disorder diagnosis', 'gender difference', 'human subject', 'keratoconjunctivitis sicca', 'occupational health /safety', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'questionnaires', 'syndrome', 'vision aid', 'vision disorders', 'visual photosensitivity', 'work site']",NEI,"SEEFIT, INC.",R41,2004,100000,0,-0.02856660533209124
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50). If feasibility conditions are met, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in Phase II to assess the efficacy of the expert system intervention for depression. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Depression is a costly illness for health care organizations, disability insurers, and employers because of increased health service utilization, disability claims, and lost productively among depressed individuals.

In combination with the epidemiologically based screening and interview results of the current study, these prospective re-evaluations will be analyzed using a combination of latent class, logistic regression, and multi-variate genetic analyses using structural equation modeling. Our hypotheses are that latent class defined ADHD subtypes will be stable over time representing highly heritable independent forms of ADHD which are associated with specific patterns of cognitive, academic testing and educational deficits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these patterns of disabilities and deficits will have differential effects on the initiation, use and abuse of psychoactive compounds such as alcohol and nicotine, on health care usage patterns and frequency of accidents. Given the results of the current funding period, we feel these analyses are likely to provide a new diagnostic formulation of ADHD syndromes which is more appropriate for identification of genetic and environmental factors influencing the etiology, course and disabilities associated with these syndromes.  n/a",Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD,6687818,R01MH052813,"['attention deficit disorder', 'behavioral genetics', 'disease /disorder classification', 'disease /disorder proneness /risk', 'family genetics', 'genetic models', 'genetic screening', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'mental health epidemiology', 'patient oriented research', 'questionnaires', 'twin /multiplet']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,621907,533594881,0.004718790899986037
"Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexually transmitted infections of the genital tract (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections of the urinary tract (UTIs) share common risk factors and presenting symptoms in women of reproductive age. Because adolescents constitute the age group at highest risk for STIs, the CDC recommends annual screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) in all sexually active (SA) adolescents, regardless of symptoms. Because the clinical presentations of CT, GC, Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), and UTI may be similar, many experts recommend interim testing for all four infections in SA adolescent females who have urinary symptoms. Despite these recommendations, there are important gaps between ideal and actual clinical practice. The availability of sensitive and specific, non-invasive tests for CT, GC, and TV may increase both routine and symptom-based STI screening of SA adolescents. However, important questions regarding the triage of symptomatic patients remain unanswered. The goal of the proposed study is to elucidate the association between STIs and UTIs in SA adolescent females. It focuses on the three STIs that are highly prevalent, likely to cause urinary symptoms, and detectable on tests of urine or patient-obtained vaginal samples. The study sample will consist of 474 SA adolescent females presenting to a hospital-based teen health center w/urinary symptoms (n=158) and w/o urinary symptoms (n=316). Each subject will be interviewed during the visit by a trained research assistant for chief complaint, genitourinary symptoms, sexual history, and past medical history. Prior to physical examination, each subject will provide a urine sample and a self-collected vaginal swab sample. The urine will be tested by ligase chain reaction for CT and GC and cultured for bacteria; the vaginal sample will be cultured for TV. The CT, GC and TV prevalence rates will be compared in subjects with and without urinary symptoms and in subjects with and without UTI, defined as over 1000 colonies of a single organism. Best subset logistic regression analyses will be performed to identify the variables that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have CT, GC, and/or TV, and the variable that identify subjects with urinary symptoms who have UTIs. The findings of this study will strengthen the evidence base for symptom-based STI testing of SA adolescent females and will promote care that addresses both individual patient and public health needs.         n/a",Urinary Symptoms in Adolescent Females: STI or UTI?,6600325,R03AI054616,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', ' Trichomonas vaginalis', ' adolescence (12-20)', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' female', ' gonorrhea', ' human subject', ' interview', ' reproductive system infection', ' sexually transmitted diseases', ' sign /symptom', ' urinalysis', ' urinary tract infection', "" women's health""]",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MED CTR (CINCINNATI),R03,2003,74500,0,0.022907507582755542
"Common and specific risk factors for emotional disorders This is a collaborative research effort of Northwestern University and the University of California, Los Angeles to evaluate common and specific risk factors for anxiety disorders and depression.  Each site will work on a common protocol.  We propose a prospective longitudinal study of 700 high school juniors, recruited in two cohorts over consecutive years at two high schools (Evanston and Santa Monica).  Using a high-risk design, participants at high risk (according to Neuroticism cores) will be oversampled relative to medium and low risk groups.  Their progression will be carefully tracked over the course of 8 to 10 assessments staggered over four to four and a half years of data collection.  The participant sample will be geographically, ethnically, and socio-economically diverse.  The proposal takes a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to the conceptualization and measurement of risk factors, which include Neuroticism, depressogenic cognitive style, anxiety sensitivity, introversion and low positive affectivity, sociotropy and autonomy.  Measures will include self report, parental report, as well as information processing tasks (modified Stroop, memory tasks), affective modulation of startle reactivity, and ambulatory cortisol assays.  In addition, diathesis-stress interactions will be evaluated on the basis of contextual assessment of chronic and episodic life stress.  Outcome will be measured in terms of symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression.  Various models of commonalities and specificities of risk and their interaction with stress will be tested using hierarchical logistic regression and structural equation modeling.

"Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD This is a resubmission of an application requesting 4 years of continued funding for grant 1R01MH52813 (Genetic Epidemiology of ADHD).

"Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression Relatively little work has explored the role of stress and social rhythms (i.e., daily routines) as they impact the circadian system in depression. The goal of this project is to investigate a theoretical model describing pathways by which social factors may be related to depression via their impact on circadian rhythms. After meeting screening criteria, 40 depressed and 40 normal control participants will complete a life events interview.  They will be given actillumes (devices which measure sleep/wake activity) and prospective, daily measures of social interactions and mood to complete over a 1-week period of time.  For both groups, linear regression will be used to predict social and circadian rhythms from social rhythm disruption (SRD) life events that have occurred within the past 4 months.  Cross-sectional analyses utilizing linear and logistic regression will investigate the relationship between circadian and social rhythms and circadian rhythms and depression.  It is predicted that individuals with depression are more sensitive and less adaptive to changes in their environment as compared to non-depressed subjects.  This project will increase our understanding of psychosocial and biological interactions involved in major depressive disorder.  In addition, this study is likely to enhance understanding of the validity of social rhythms as a construct.  This line of research may provide guidelines for addressing circadian factors when developing interventions. n/a",Circadian Impact of Psychosocial Factors in Depression,6445959,F31MH064255,"['behavioral /social science research tag', ' bioperiodicity', ' body physical activity', ' circadian rhythms', ' clinical research', ' depression', ' emotions', ' human subject', ' interpersonal relations', ' interview', ' photobiology', ' predoctoral investigator', ' psychological adaptation', ' psychological stressor', ' psychological tests', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires', ' sleep', ' social psychology']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,F31,2002,25018,0,0.04005363304806978

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6392530,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2001,60756,45734163,0.007629968478193108

"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.

"ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT  The proposed project involves a preliminary investigation of                                                                                   potentially significant methodological advance in diagnostic assessment. The         current state-of-the-art in diagnostic assessment involves the use of a              structured interview. Typically, structured interviews involve a static skip         structure, i.e., some portions of the interview are administered conditional on                                 particular responses to prior questions. For example, if there is a negative         response to a question about depression and anhedonia, most structured               interviews require the clinical to skip the remaining questions about                associated symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, etc.).         Although structured interviews represent an enormous advantage over earlier          diagnostic procedures, their inflexible structure is often incompatible with         the heterogeneity of most child and adolescent populations, and can result in        superfluous questioning about uncommon disorders and insufficient follow-up          about more common ones. Many interviews do not make exceptions for individual        characteristics. For example, 1) a 17 year old boy might need to answer ""no"" to      5 or 6 questions about separation anxiety before the interviewer may move on to      another set of questions; or 2) an underweight 16 year old girl might not be         asked important follow-up questions when replying ""no"" to the initial question       about eating disorders. One might conclude that introducing more clinician           flexibility would be the solution; however, the literature on clinical judgment      suggests that increasing clinician involvement in determination of interview         structure would likely degrade classification accuracy and introduce unwanted        sources of error and bias. To address this issue in another manner, the              principal investigator has developed a data-driven, actuarial expert system to       guide a flexible interview structure. Thus, interview structure is dynamically       responsive to individual characteristics, without introducing error associated       with qualitative clinical judgments. Pilot modeling revealed that his system         offers advantages in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art diagnostic        approaches, with the additional benefit of reducing administration time for          particular disorders. The current project is planned to generate requisite data      to develop a formal expert system and to forecast its relative accuracy and          efficiency in a child and adolescent population. It is predicted that this           system will demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy over a static        structured interview approach, with reduced administration time. If the data         are supportive, these developments have the potential to significantly advance       the manner in which future diagnostic interviews are conducted with mental           health populations.                                                                                                                                                       n/a",ACTUARIAL STRATEGIES IN CHILD DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT,6096946,R03MH060134,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' anxiety', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' child (0-11)', ' child behavior disorders', ' child psychology', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' depression', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' interview', ' mathematical model', ' mental disorder diagnosis', ' model design /development', ' mood disorders', ' psychometrics', ' questionnaires']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R03,2000,63589,45734163,0.007629968478193108
"TRAUMATIC GRIEF IN LATER-LIFE: CRITERIA, RISKS, OUTCOMES Symptoms of Traumatic Grief (TG) (e.g., yearning, searching, detachment, emptiness, futility) have been found to form a unified syndrome distinct from symptoms of depression and anxiety, to have risk factors, clinical correlates, and a response to pharmacotherapy distinct from depressive symptoms, to predict substantial morbidity (e.g., high blood pressure, suicidality), and to persist for years.  While these findings suggest the need for separate diagnostic criteria for TG, no standardized criteria exist.  The PI convened a panel of experts to formulate a criteria set for TG.  The primary aim of this proposal is to test the performance of the consensus criteria and to define parameters the panel left unspecified (e.g., determine the timing/duration criterion, number and severity of symptoms required for diagnosis).  A sample of 360 widowed subjects aged 65 years and older will be recruited into the study at 2 months post-loss.  The self-administered Inventory of Traumatic Grief (ITG) and the rater-administered Traumatic Grief Evaluation of Response to Loss (TRGR2L) structured interview will assess subjects on the proposed TG symptoms.  Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Item Response Theory (IRT) analyses will be used to develop optimally efficient diagnostic algorithms for TG.  Follow-up interviews at 6 and 15 months post-loss will provide information on symptom resolution over time, allow for a comparison of the morbidity associated with different temporal trajectories (e.g., chronic and delayed subtypes), and the determination of prevalence rates and temporal stability of a TG diagnosis over time.  Logistic regression models will estimate the effects of insecure and/or anxious romantic attachment styles, security-increasing marriages, and lack of social integration on the likelihood of meeting criteria for TG.  Random regression analyses will be used to estimate the effects of meeting criteria for TG on suicidality, and degree of impaired health and functioning.  Results will provide a validated diagnostic algorithm for TG derived from proposed consensus criteria, and psychometrically sound and clinically useful assessment tools for this disorder.
