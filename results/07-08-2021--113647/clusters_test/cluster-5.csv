"The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma Abstract Singers are known to be at an increased risk of developing voice disorders and often represent a large percentage of patients who are seen at voice clinics. One of the most common disorders seen in singers is vocal fold nodules that result from chronic trauma to vocal fold tissue, referred to as phonotrauma or phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH). While PVH in singers is thought do be due to the simple increase in vocal demands associated with singing, it continues to be unclear why some singers develop PVH though others do not. One factor that has been shown to be more highly associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders is personality, as described in the “Trait Theory of Voice Disorders.” Testing of this theory has provided empirical evidence that those with PVH score significantly higher on measures of extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than individuals with healthy voices. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information about whether personality relates to PVH in a similar way to singers. We hypothesize that singers with PVH will score significantly higher on personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity than singers without PVH. Additionally, information is also lacking about whether personality traits correlate with daily vocal behaviors. PVH in singers is often assumed to be the sole result of how the voice is used when singing. Our preliminary work using an ambulatory voice monitor and an automated singing classifier has shown a larger number of significant differences between singers with PVH and normal controls during speaking than during singing across a full week of monitoring. We expect that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be significantly correlated with ambulatory measures that reflect the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load, specifically in speech. We hypothesize that these relationships will be stronger in singers with PVH compared to healthy singers. The goal of the proposed project is to determine if certain personality traits are significantly related to the presence of PVH in singers and/or to the daily vocal behaviors that could contribute to the etiology and pathophysiology of phonotrauma in singers. We will administer a multidimensional personality inventory to singers diagnosed with PVH and vocally healthy matched-singers. We will compare each trait scale for singers with PVH and healthy singers using a t- test and then determine which traits are more predictive of patient status using a stepwise binary logistic regression. Each participant will also be monitored for one typical week using an ambulatory voice monitor. Relationships between personality traits scales and voice-related parameters will be conducted using Pearson's r correlations, and linear multiple regression will be used to determine which traits are the most predictive of vocal behavior. The new knowledge produced by this project could be used to aid in improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vocal nodules in singers, particularly with respect to predicting which singers are at a greater risk for developing vocal fold nodules, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment. Laura Toles PROJECT NARRATIVE Singers are known carry an elevated risk of developing voice disorders, specifically those that are presumed to result from chronic vocal fold tissue trauma such as vocal fold nodules. However, despite the increased voice use requirements of singing, not all singers develop vocal fold nodules. This study aims to identify the influence that personality traits have on ambulatory voice behaviors to differentiate singers with vocal fold nodules from singers with healthy voices. Specifically, we hypothesize that personality measures related to extraversion, neuroticism, and impulsivity will be more strongly correlated with the amount and type of daily voice use or vocal load in speech in singers with vocal fold nodules. We expect that knowledge gained from this project will be useful to improve prevention of vocal fold nodules through prediction of individual risk for singers, and in targeting specific daily vocal behaviors during treatment.",The Influence of Personality on Vocal Behavior in Singers with Phonotrauma,10371003,F31DC019284,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Behavior', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nodule', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Personality Traits', 'Personality inventories', 'Prevention', 'Risk', 'Speech', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Vocal Cord Nodule', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'social', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tissue trauma', 'trait', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,MGH INSTITUTE OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS,F31,2021,2500,1683766
"Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries PROJECT SUMMARY  Each year, traumatic injuries affect millions of Americans, resulting in $671 billion in healthcare costs and lost productivity. They are also the leading cause of death before age 47 and of years of potential life lost before age 75. In addition to societal costs, symptoms, such as pain, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders are highly prevalent following traumatic orthopaedic injuries (TOI) and may contribute to negative long-term health outcomes.  Identifying symptom cluster profiles following TOI may lead to recognizing those at highest risk for negative outcomes. Although the mechanisms for symptom cluster profiles are not completely known, they may share a common etiology. Using a theoretical framework created by incorporating the National Institutes of Health Symptom Science Model and the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, the proposed study will utilize a cross- sectional design to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles, examine the associations between demographic and clinical factors and membership in symptom cluster profiles, and measure the extent to which serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the val66met single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene are associated with membership in symptom cluster profiles among a diverse sample of TOI survivors recruited within the first 24 hours of their injury in a large, urban level one trauma center. Latent profile analysis with multinomial logistic regression will be used to describe group membership in the symptom cluster profiles and their associations with demographic and clinical factors and biomarker data.  The aims of this study are to 1) describe TOI survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles, indicated by pain, sleep disturbance, and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress related disorders, immediately following a TOI; and 2) examine associations between demographic and clinical factors and symptom cluster profile membership among TOI survivors. 3) test the hypothesis that low serum concentrations of BDNF are associated with membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI; and 4) test the hypothesis that the presence of the val66met SNP on one or both alleles of the BDNF gene is associated membership among symptom cluster profiles following TOI.  The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies examining self- and symptom management following TOI. The training plan includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the biobehavioral responses of individuals following TOI, and the screening and management of post-injury symptoms. Aligned with the NINR's strategic plan to promote precision health through research of the role of biomarkers in symptom science, the proposed work will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating biobehavioral mechanisms of, and interventions for, symptom cluster profiles in TOI survivors. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Experiencing a traumatic orthopaedic injury exposes individuals to the risk of developing post-injury symptoms that may present in a comorbid manner, or cluster, to affect long term health outcomes and health- related quality of life. Identifying subgroups of TOI survivors based upon their symptom experiences, or symptom cluster profiles, can reveal those at highest risk for developing negative outcomes, who may be in the greatest need of intervention. The purpose of this study is to describe membership in symptom cluster profiles among survivors of traumatic orthopaedic injuries and to examine the way in which demographic and clinical factors and biomarkers explain survivors' membership in symptom cluster profiles.",Symptom Cluster Profiles Following Traumatic Orthopaedic Injuries,10218102,F31NR018996,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Fracture Healing', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Status', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methionine', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nursing Research', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Management', 'Serum', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Spinal Cord', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Valine', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'career', 'clinical care', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'enhancing factor', 'experience', 'healing', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual response', 'neuron development', 'neurotrophic factor', 'pain symptom', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'screening', 'societal costs', 'stress related disorder', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'trauma centers']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38527,550947887
"Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding ABSTRACT Hoarding Disorder (HD), recognized as an independent illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for less than a decade, is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts. Emerging data shows that hoarding severity correlates with substantial medical burden. Prevalence of clinically significant hoarding behavior is estimated to be between 2 and 4%, with a higher burden in the older population. However, it is believed that hoarding disorder is underdiagnosed. The parent R01MH117114 combines in-person clinical, neuropsychological, and medical frailty assessments with a unique epidemiologic resource, the online Brain Health Registry (BHR) 17, to assess the extent of disability in older adults suffering with hoarding symptoms. To date, over 24,000 subjects have taken hoarding-related questionnaires. In addition, 1554 participants have completed additional surveys performed for validation of hoarding symptoms. Moreover, the BHR includes longitudinal objective and subjective measures of cognition, as well as childhood and medical history. We will classify longitudinal trends of measures of hoarding symptomatology in a subpopulation of the BHR with clinical assessments of hoarding disorders and other psychopathologies. We will then project the whole BHR population to classify longitudinal trends. We will then apply statistical inference and techniques from artificial intelligence to identify predictors of various trends of hoarding symptomatology to find predictors of developing severe hoarding symptoms. Ongoing recruitment through the parent R01 will allow for validation of the predictions made through this work. Moreover, as there is a rapid increase in the number of psychiatric studies using web-based data collection methods rather than in-person clinical assessments, the importance of studying the temporal trends and fidelity of these data collection methods extends beyond the scope of the current study. The present study will provide a proof-of-concept approach for analyzing such data.  The work will be carried out by a trained mathematician transitioning into systems medicine whose career goal is to establish an independent career in the field of computational psychiatry. The training provided through this grant will prepare the supplement candidate to submit an independent K01 award on the interactions between late life depression and hoarding disorder to the National Institute of Mental Health. This will be done by providing tailored mentoring by experts in hoarding disorder and systems medicine, access to unique datasets related to various psychopathologies, structured training in grant writing and responsible conduct in research, a structured course in psychopathology, and premier computational resources at the University of Florida. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hoarding Disorder (HD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with profound socioeconomic impacts characterized by difficulty discarding seemingly worthless objects. This study will identify risk-factors for developing troublesome hoarding by integrating and analyzing clinical interviews and a web-based registry of adults that includes various medical and cognitive questionnaires and neurocognitive tests.",Predicting populations at-risk of developing pathological hoarding,10253596,R01MH117114,"['Adult', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain Health Registry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive Hoarding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Impairment', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Low income', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Older Population', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Self Assessment', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Unemployment', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computing resources', 'disability', 'frailty', 'geriatric depression', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'recruit', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,68363,188894159
"Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA), depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA, depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life- course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context. Project Narrative Green space or trees and natural vegetation can provide mental health benefits and possibly lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); however, green space is often measured poorly in epidemiologic research. I propose to integrate high-resolution images from Google Street Views to derive ground-level objective measurements of green space into a diverse prospective cohort study using deep learning algorithms, mediation analysis and geographic mixtures. This research will enable unprecedented perspectives on exposures that drive ADRD and related cognitive decline risk, and will provide translational insights into potential interventions to optimize opportunities for ADRD prevention and reduce racial disparities in ADRD.",Neurodegenerative diseases and the role of green space: A deep learning assessment,10146274,K99AG066949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air Pollutants', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Baltimore', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chicago', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geographic Factor', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Green space', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impaired cognition', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Los Angeles', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'New York', 'Noise', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Plants', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Social Environment', 'Social Impacts', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'aged', 'base', 'built environment', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dementia risk', 'design', 'economic impact', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'healthy aging', 'high resolution imaging', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'men', 'multidimensional data', 'neurocognitive disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial health disparity', 'racial minority', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'urban public health']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2021,118800,146629556
"Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes PROJECT SUMMARY  Ambulatory assessment (AA) techniques (e.g., ecological momentary assessment, daily diaries, experiencing sampling) have provided critical tests of theories about the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) by identifying within-person processes (such as negative or reinforcement, stress exposure, or social context) that can raise the risk for problem drinking and in turn AUD. AA methods are the leading methodological approach in the push towards personalized medicine because it provides a compelling platform for assessment, diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and just-in-time interventions. However, the current utility of AA for personalized models of AUD risk is limited because risky drinking and the risk factors for it (such as changes in moods, stress, or social contexts) change at different scales of time. In other words, even heavy drinkers may only drink a few times a week, but their emotions, stressors and social contexts change multiple times a day. Current AA methods that rely on self-report data have to sample frequently enough to be sensitive to change, long enough to observe sufficient drinking episodes, and to do so while avoiding participant burnout. Passive mobile sensing, which uses sensors (such as GPS, accelerometer, light meter, etc.) available on most smartphones, has been shown in preliminary studies to predict the probability of drinking episodes, but those studies have used relatively small samples. The present career development award aims to develop the candidate’s expertise in passive mobile sensing and the machine learning methods used to analyze passive mobile sensing data. The research proposal will analyze passive mobile sensing data collected in a large sample of regular drinking and marijuana using young adults (age 18 – 22, n = 500; 95.2% who drink), who will be followed using AA over 8 successive weekends as part of a parent R01 (DA 047247). The research goal is to identify passive mobile sensing models of risk factors for drinking (stress, social contexts, sleep, mood, and impulsive states), as well as the drinking episodes themselves. The candidate will develop expertise in these methods and models that will further the development of a research program aimed at developing person specific models of risk for AUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The career development plan will develop expertise of the investigator in the collection and analysis of passive mobile sensing data, with an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods. The proposed research study will use passive mobile sensing data in a large ambulatory assessment sample of regular drinkers, to develop models linking passive mobile sensing data with predictors of drinking episodes (such as stress, social context, and impulsiveness) and the drinking episodes themselves.",Passive mobile sensing and machine learning for the detection of drinking episodes,10102612,K02AA028832,"['Accelerometer', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Collection', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Security', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotions', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impulsivity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Light', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'analytical method', 'burnout', 'career development', 'data streams', 'design', 'diaries', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk drinking', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'meter', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'research study', 'sensor', 'stressor', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2021,142338,533302350
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027,570146095
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604,254622553
"Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App PROJECT SUMMARY Background: Depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period affects up to 15% of US mothers, imposing costs on mother, child, and society. Early detection can significantly reduce the incidence of depression, yet depressive symptoms are often missed during prenatal visits, which tend to focus on maternal and fetal physical health, leaving less time for maternal mental health. Even if mental health is addressed during prenatal care, women may not feel comfortable answering questions that are perceived to be embarrassing or invasive. Failing to detect depression is even more likely during the postpartum period due to infrequent physician visits once the baby has been born. Measurement in the form of daily journals, which can be analyzed using natural language processing, can promote early and more frequent detection of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study Aims: 1) Model which dynamic features of language used over time best predict changes in depression status in the pregnancy and postpartum periods, creating phenotypes of depression risk; 2) examine how the language patterns that predict depression differ for African-American and Caucasian women; and 3) identify the relationship between the characteristics of what depressed peripartum women say and their treatment-seeking behavior. Innovation: The proposed research is innovative in its use of high frequency natural language measurements, captured in daily journals using a smartphone app, combined with advances in natural language processing models, to assess the onset and trajectory of depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This is the first prospective longitudinal study using natural language collection for risk prediction in a clinical population and the first to: 1) characterize the critical topics women discuss during the peripartum period over time using open-ended journals; 2) evaluate multiple facets of language to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between language and depression; 3) use a longitudinal design approach allowing for optimal modeling of language changes associated with depression onset. Methodology and Expected Results: Monthly depression risk identified from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. will be collected through the MyHealthyPregnancy smartphone app, a mobile health application developed through close collaboration between decision scientists, clinicians, statisticians, and local peripartum women. A daily journal embedded in the MyHealthyPregnancy app will collect natural language text from the participants for 10 months (from their first prenatal visit through two months postpartum). Using three distinct natural language processing algorithmic approaches, this study will characterize how the natural language used by peripartum women in their daily journal entries is connected to the onset and experience of peripartum depression, as measured through monthly-administered depression scales. Group- based trajectory modeling will then classify women according to the patterns in their depression scores over time. Potential Impact: This work lays the foundation for developing and evaluating real-time interventions that could be deployed at scale to women who are using language that signals high depression risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will examine how the topics (the people and events mentioned), sentiment (the positive, negative, and neutral affect), and other aspects of language expressed in daily journal entries correspond to diagnostic measures of depression and treatment-seeking in a peripartum clinical population. Psychometric and daily journal entry data will be gathered through an existing smartphone app, MyHealthyPregnancy, which monitors risk and delivers actionable information as part of routine prenatal care provided to the pregnant members of a large regional healthcare system.",Identification and Prediction of Peripartum Depression from Natural Language Collected in a Mobile Health App,10111569,R21MH119450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure to Thrive', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Psychometrics', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'fetal', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'motherhood', 'natural language', 'patient subsets', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'pregnant', 'racial disparity', 'response', 'routine screening', 'smartphone Application', 'social culture', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,194684,570146095
"Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Converging evidence has linked the habenula (Hb), a small epithalamic structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling, to a wide range of affective, motivational, and motor functions. Abnormalities in Hb circuitry are increasingly implicated in psychiatric and behavioral disorders. In vivo Hb research has proceeded slowly, however, due to technical constraints in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that make it difficult to define and characterize this small region. Understanding of the Hb is especially limited in adolescence, a critical period marked by rapid maturation of the reward system and, often, the first emergence of psychiatric disorders. To address these gaps in basic and clinical neuroscience, our proposal leverages the unprecedented scale and quality of high-resolution neuroimaging data available through the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the development of Hb function in early adolescence and its role in psychiatric illness onset. The proposed research builds on extensive work by our group to develop and refine Hb imaging methodology, including automated segmentation and a region of interest optimization approach that significantly improves Hb fMRI sensitivity, and is supported by substantial data from our laboratory. In independent samples of adult and adolescent healthy controls (HCs), we found a highly consistent pattern of positive Hb intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) with the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), downstream nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cortical salience network (SN), as well as negative Hb iFC throughout the default mode network (DMN). Adults with high vs. low subclinical depression scores exhibited distinct iFC patterns with regions associated with anxiety and depression, including the amygdala and insula. Moreover, adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders had positive Hb iFC with the DMN, and this abnormal Hb-DMN iFC pattern was associated with anxiety severity across both healthy and clinical adolescents, while hyperconnectivity with SN and other expected Hb targets correlated with anhedonia. Building on our compelling findings to date, we propose to study Hb function at Baseline and Year 2 ABCD neuroimaging timepoints in relation to normative (Aim 1) and clinical (Aim 2) developmental trajectories. Subjects will comprise two cohorts of ~3000 adolescents each: clinical subjects, with significant past or current mood and anxiety symptoms, and HCs, with no history of psychiatric diagnoses or clinically significant symptoms. Study procedures will incorporate sophisticated preprocessing and denoising, optimized subject-level Hb definition, neuroanatomically accurate cortical surface mapping, and rigorous non-parametric statistics. Analyses will encompass both resting-state and task fMRI to characterize Hb iFC and activation during specific reward, loss, and inhibitory control processes. We will examine both group differences and associations with psychiatric symptom severity using hypothesis-driven as well as machine learning approaches.  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to advance basic and clinical neuroscientific understanding of the habenula, a small structure that inhibits dopaminergic reward signaling and is increasingly implicated in psychiatric disorders. The technical difficulty of studying the habenula has limited in vivo research, especially in adolescent populations where psychiatric symptoms often first emerge. Using an optimize analysis approach and a large sample of high- resolution neuroimaging data from the ABCD study, we propose to comprehensively investigate habenula function in normative early adolescent development and in the onset and trajectory of adolescent mental illness.",Habenula Developmental Trajectories in the ABCD Study,10234369,R21MH126501,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Health', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epithalamic structure', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habenula', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonparametric Statistics', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'animal data', 'anxiety symptoms', 'automated segmentation', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'denoising', 'early adolescence', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'reward circuitry', 'subclinical depression', 'tv watching']",NIMH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,210000,199779478
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878,673201228
"CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Project Summary/Abstract Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In determine an exploratory ML analysis, we will the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are strongly linked t o functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk.

"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms.

"Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention. Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence. Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments, have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec- tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup- port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul- sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro- cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con- tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur- suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda- tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study. The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study aims to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system to analyze participant interviews, detect students at elevated risk of school violence, and provide risk characteristics to assist prevention. The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing an ARIA system will help establish a nationwide solution for detecting and preventing school violence. The objectives of this proposal are consistent with NICHD's high-priority research areas that aim to develop new knowledge about the identification, etiology, early intervention, and mechanisms of violence from childhood through early adulthood.",Automated Risk Assessment for School Violence Prevention,10096109,R01HD103630,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Legal Guardians', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Process Assessment', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'impression', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'school violence', 'school violence prevention', 'screening', 'study population', 'youth violence']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,457950,168440418
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501,551214295
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles Project Summary/Abstract  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is uncommon in childhood, but becomes increasingly prevalent during adolescence. By the age of 18, about 15% of adolescents will have experienced at least one episode of MDD, with females twice as likely than males to have suffered an episode. This developmental surge in depression is especially high among teens who have a parent with a history of MDD, with close to half developing the disorder by the end of adolescence. Despite these epidemiological findings, and the range of negative downstream consequences linked to MDD, there are strikingly little data on the neural and behavioral abnormalities that confer risk for future depression onset in youth. The ability to prospectively predict MDD prior to its onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth, which is strongly aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan.  To address these gaps, adolescents ages 12-15 at increased risk of MDD onset by virtue of a parental history of MDD, as well as a control sample with no parental history of depression, will complete baseline neural (fMRI) and behavioral assessments of replicated endophenotypes of MDD (neuroticism, anhedonia, cognitive control deficits). Growing evidence and our preliminary data suggest that these endophenotypes are relatively stable trait-like risk markers, have non-overlapping neural substrates, and precede and prospectively predict depression onset. The project has three aims. First, we will evaluate the neural correlates of these three endophenotypes in an adolescent sample (n = 148), half of whom are at elevated risk of MDD (Aim 1). Second, during a 24-month follow-up phase, participants will be contacted by phone every 6 months and administered measures to assess changes in symptoms. Analyses will test whether behavioral and neural endophenotype measures prospectively predict onset of depressive symptoms during the follow-up phase. Importantly, to evaluate incremental predictive validity, we will test whether each endophenotype measure predicts future depressive symptoms above and beyond relevant clinical, familial/demographic and developmental variables previously linked with risk of future depression (Aim 2). Third, we will test whether multivariate machine learning models incorporating behavioral and neural endophenotype markers, as well as clinical, familial/demographic, and developmental characteristics, can be used to predict subject-specific risk of future depression onset with sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity to be clinically useful (Aim 3). Critically, recent advances in machine learning allow for the development of algorithms predicting risk at the individual level, as well as the integration of numerous predictors rather than relying on single variables that may, in isolation, have limited clinically-useful predictive value. Collectively, results are expected to advance our ability to predict the onset of depressive symptoms and, ultimately, to inform the development of a freely available, web-based risk calculator for predicting subject-specific depression risk. Project Narrative The prevalence of depression increases dramatically during adolescence, particularly for females. Using machine learning algorithms, the overarching goal of the project is to identify neural and behavioral markers that – in combination with clinical and demographic characteristics – reliably predict risk of developing depression during adolescence. The ability to prospectively predict depression prior to its initial onset would have important clinical implications for the early identification of – and targeted deployment of interventions for – at-risk youth.",Predicting the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents from endophenotype profiles,10051424,R01MH116969,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Positive Valence', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'algorithm development', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'indexing', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neural correlate', 'pleasure', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'socioeconomics', 'trait']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,532914,44711126
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790,164685352
"5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk Summary Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion. Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study (NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk. Narrative Early detection of young people at clinical high risk for psychosis offers a critical opportunity for early intervention to improve the course of illness, and perhaps even prevent onset entirely. Current interview- based methods for psychosis risk detection lack specificity, and are only available in a handful of research centers in the United States. The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",5/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of Psychosis Risk,10122993,R01MH120089,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'comparison group', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'metropolitan', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,579032,550947887

In an exploratory ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.

The proposed study aims to improve accessibility and broaden impact of high risk screening by testing brief computerized measures, ultimately able to be administered on the internet, and to improve prediction by focusing on tasks specific to underlying mechanisms driving emerging psychotic symptoms.",1/5 CAPER: Computerized Assessment of ProdromE Risk,10122994,R01MH120090,"['Address', 'American', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional outcomes', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'prevent', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'social', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,583239,230060143
"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10264169,R01AG070822,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American Indians', 'Anger', 'Anthropology', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hostility', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Navajo', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Persons', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Social Network', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Spirituality', 'Stress', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Tribes', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'base', 'bullying', 'clinical examination', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohort', 'disability', 'eligible participant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'instrument', 'intergenerational', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optimism', 'practical application', 'psychosocial', 'public health intervention', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'trait', 'tribal community']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,590213,41751724
"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973,227555357
"Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia Abstract Schizophrenia constitutes a chronic and disabling illness. While patients show high rates of response to treatment after a ﬁrst-episode of schizophrenia, the long-term course of the illness is typically characterized by frequent re- lapses, persistence of symptoms, and enduring cognitive and functional deﬁcits. Despite the prioritization of relapse prevention as a treatment goal, about four out of ﬁve patients experience a relapse within the ﬁrst ﬁve years of treatment. Relapses are known to have serious psychosocial, educational, or vocational implications in young adults—a population at high risk of psychosis. However, current psychiatric ability to recognize indicators of relapse in order to prevent escalation of psychotic symptoms is markedly limited. Challenges stem from a lack of availability of comprehensive information about early warning signs, and reliance on ﬁxed time point sampling of cross-sectional data as well as patient or family reported observations, that is subject to recall bias, or on clin- ician sought information, that needs frequent and timely contact. The present proposal seeks to address these gaps in early psychosis treatment, by leveraging patient-generated and patient-volunteered social media data, and developing and validating machine learning approaches for “digital phenotyping” and relapse prediction. Our proposed work is founded on the observation that social media sites have emerged as prominent platforms of emotional and linguistic expression—young adults are among the heaviest users of social media. The work signif- icantly advances the research agenda and extensive pilot investigations of the team, who a) have demonstrated that social media data of individuals can serve as a powerful “lens” toward understanding and inferring mental health state, illness course, and likelihood of relapse, including among young adults with early psychosis; and b) have been involved in examining the role of emergent technologies, like social media, in improving access to and delivery of psychiatric care. Aim 1 will provide theoretically-grounded and clinically meaningful methods for extracting and modeling digital phenotypes and symptoms from social media data of young adult early psychosis patients. Then in Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate machine learning methods that will utilize the extracted social media digital phenotypes to infer patient-speciﬁc personalized risk of relapse, and identify its antecedents. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a two-faceted validation framework, to assess the statistical and clinical efﬁcacy and utility of the social media derived inferences of psychosis and relapse in inﬂuencing clinical outcomes and in facilitating evidence-based treatment. To accomplish these aims, the project brings together a strong multidisci- plinary team, combining expertise in social media analytics, psychiatry, psychology, natural language analysis, machine learning, information privacy, and research ethics. Our novel approach offers unprecedented opportuni- ties to initiate the adoption of personalized, responsive, and preemptive evidence-based strategies in treatment of psychosis. The knowledge will set the stage for future research on launching large-scale trials aimed to develop interventions that diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether. Project Narrative Timely monitoring of symptoms and preventing relapse after an initial psychotic episode are essential component of early intervention programs and have a critical impact on long term outcome in individuals with psychotic dis- orders. Employing patient-contributed social media data as a viable source of collateral information, this proposal provides a suite of robust, scalable, and ﬁeld evaluated machine learning methods to facilitate early and precise identiﬁcation of digital phenotypes, symptomatic exacerbation, and risk of psychotic relapse in early psychosis patients. The knowledge would provide the necessary opportunity to initiate personalized, adaptive, and proac- tive illness management strategies, inform better nosology, and assist the adoption of improved evidence-based care approaches to diminish the severity of relapses, or prevent their occurrence altogether.",Leveraging Social Media Data and Machine Learning to Optimize Treatment Paradigms for Youth with Schizophrenia,10119327,R01MH117172,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disorientation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Psychology', 'Source', 'Stigmatization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital media', 'digital models', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'family burden', 'first episode schizophrenia', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'intervention program', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'medical complication', 'multidisciplinary', 'natural language', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'recruit', 'relapse patients', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social observations', 'stem', 'support tools', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'volunteer', 'willingness', 'young adult']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,641065,45341731
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,10053725,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,656876,570146095
"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox.

"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144,44711126
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,10164863,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2021,694636,44711126
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nation’s only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms. Identifying such markers for bipolar disorder has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of illness and informing treatment planning and personalized interventions.",From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models,10116487,R01MH121451,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manic', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parietal', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Polysomnography', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'aged', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'childhood bipolar disorder', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'high-risk adolescents', 'hypomania', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'mobile application', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment planning', 'two-dimensional', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,695997,570146095
"Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders Project Summary/Abstract  Disorders of mood and psychosis such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression are  incredibly complex, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and the clinical characterizations are primarily based on symptoms rather than biological information. Current diagnostic approaches are based on symptoms, which overlap extensively in some cases, and there is growing consensus that we should approach mental illness as a continuum, rather than as a categorical entity. Since both genetic and environmental factors play a large role in mental illness, the combination of brain imaging and genomic data are poised to play an important role is clarifying our understanding of mental illness. However, both imaging and genomic data are high dimensional and include complex relationships that are poorly understood. To characterize the available information, we are in need of approaches that can deal with high-dimensional data exhibiting interactions at multiple levels (i.e., data fusion), while providing interpretable solutions (i.e., a focus on brain and genomic  networks). An additional challenge exists because the available data has mixed temporal dimensionality, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not change over time, brain structure changes slowly over time, while fMRI changes rapidly over time. To address these challenges, we introduce a new unified framework called flexible subspace analysis (FSA) that can automatically identify subspaces (groupings of unimodal or multimodal  components) in joint multimodal data. Our approach leverages the interpretability of source separation approaches and can include additional flexibility by allowing for a combination of shallow and ‘deep’ subspaces, thus  leveraging the power of deep learning. We will apply the developed models to a large (N>60,000) dataset of  individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum to evaluate the important question of disease categorization. We will compute fully cross-validated genomic-neuro-behavioral profiles of individuals including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of 1) standard categories from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM), 2) data-driven subgroups, and 3) dimensional relationships. We will also evaluate the single subject predictive power of these profiles in independent data to maximize generalization. All methods and results will be shared with the community. The combination of advanced algorithmic approach plus the large N data  promises to advance our understanding of the nosology of mood and psychosis disorders in addition to providing new tools that can be widely applied to other studies of complex disease. Project Narrative  It is clear that mood and psychosis disorders, largely diagnosed without biological criteria, include a multitude of inter-related genetic and environmental factors. We propose to develop new flexible models to capture  multiscale (dynamic) brain imaging and genomics data, which we will use to study individuals along the mood and psychosis spectrum using a large aggregated dataset including a comparison of the predictive accuracy of two dichotomous approaches (standard diagnostic categories and unsupervised/data-driven) as well as a  dimensional approach to diagnosis.",Dynamic imaging-genomic models for characterizing and predicting psychosis and mood disorders,10112311,R01MH118695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Property', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Work', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'blind', 'connectome', 'data anonymization', 'data fusion', 'data repository', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'independent component analysis', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'profiles in patients', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychotic symptoms', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,705172,43632870
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829,570146095
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138,44711126
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998,570146095
"Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers PROJECT SUMMARY Efforts at early identification of individuals at risk for psychosis are propelled by the realization that psychosis is neurodevelopmental, with brain and behavioral abnormalities anteceding diagnosis of schizophrenia (SZ) by years. As longer duration of untreated psychosis portends poor outcome, early identification is important to bend the developmental trajectory in a favorable direction. Since most current studies of psychosis risk are based on help-seeking samples, there is a gap in knowledge on how psychosis unfolds in diverse community samples. While it is generally recognized that genomic and environmental factors (GxE) contribute to risk for psychosis, there is a paucity of complementary integrative studies that can chart causal pathways. Genomic “case-control” GWAS studies of SZ identified multiple common alleles permitting calculation of a polygenic risk score (PRS). Recently, increased attention has been given to childhood adversity related to SZ. The goal of the proposed R01 is to build on our genotyped ~10,000 Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) of 8 to 21 years old youths studied in 2009-2011, where we are following those who meet criteria or are at risk for psychosis (PS) and typically developing (TD) participants, whose current age range is 15-30 years. Available multi-level “deep phenotyping” includes clinical, neurocognition and multi-modal neuroimaging on a subsample of ~1600. We have developed a preliminary environmental risk score (ERS) and will use it to dissect GxE. The proposed followup design will recruit PS and TD participants with the highest and lowest scorers (quartile) on the ERS, and within each of these four cells we will examine 120 individuals, 60 males and 60 females (total N=480). This sample will be examined clinically, neurocognitively and with multimodal neuroimaging. We will test the hypothesis that genomic vulnerabilities, based on PRS and family history, and environmental adversity, based on ERS, updated longitudinally, affect onset and course of PS by altering brain development in temporolimbic regions affecting fronto-limbic connectivity that underlies social functioning. We will augment current data with information on risk and resilience and multimodal brain-behavior parameters to establish developmental trajectories during this critical period of brain maturation when psychosis emerges. Our aims are: 1. Examine effects of ERS on PS clinical features and progression in relation to PRS. 2. Investigate brain- behavior parameters that bridge from genetic and environmental factors to clinical manifestations. 3. Establish developmental trajectories for PS features, associated brain parameters and neurocognitive deficits, and apply novel computational models to enable an adaptive “risk and resilience calculator”. The proposed study will produce the data absent for a diverse US community sample but needed to move psychiatry into the precision medicine era. The project will inform on genomic and environmental risk and resilience indicators, offering an essential rung in the ladder toward individualized prediction, a part of implementation science. As with the PNC, data and associated algorithms will be a resource shared with the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed R01 aims to bridge genomic, environment and phenotypic brain-behavior measures to advance the understanding of risk and resilience to psychosis. We will build on informative samples of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort and integrate multidimensional behavioral measures of psychosis and cognition, multimodal neuroimaging parameters of brain structure, function and connectivity, environmental parameters, and genomic variations in risk for schizophrenia. Computational modeling will aim at developing risk and resilience predictors, essential for early identification and intervention during a dynamic period of brain maturation.",Evolution of Psychosis in Youth: Multimodal Risk and Resilience Markers,10149410,R01MH119219,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linear Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Functioning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'childhood adversity', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'data anonymization', 'design', 'early adolescence', 'emerging adult', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'polygenic risk score', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychiatric genomics', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'sex', 'social']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,733897,593605914
"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10162387,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,759049,593605914
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10067383,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,765655,338121506
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,10023371,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'remote screening', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2021,790709,0
"Longitudinal neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment of risk and protective factors across the schizophrenia spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is similar to schizophrenia (SZ), but with fewer and attenuated abnormalities, thus representing an important yet understudied intermediate SZ-spectrum phenotype. Examination of abnormalities in SPD will provide information regarding etiology, genetics, treatment and risk factors associated with psychosis. Although individuals with SPD demonstrate marked temporal lobe abnormalities that resemble SZ, we hypothesize that relative “sparing” or “functional enhancement” in the frontal lobes (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), may protect these individuals from frank psychosis and the severe social and cognitive deficits typically observed in SZ. Studying SPD is powerful as antipsychotic medication and hospitalization confounds observed in SZ are not present. Moreover, there is no study examining neurobiological changes in the SZ-spectrum that incorporates individuals with SPD using a longitudinal design as proposed here. This novel approach will help disentangle potential risk and protective factors for psychosis in the SZ spectrum. This is the first longitudinal study to utilize multimodal MR imaging and Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approaches in SZ-spectrum disorders to identify aberrant neural circuitry along a continuum from healthy controls (HCs) to SPD to SZ and examine changes in these measures in relationship to impairments in symptom severity, neurocognition and functional outcome. We propose studying three groups (80 in each) of demographically matched and rigorously diagnosed individuals (age 18- 40): HCs (no Axis I or personality disorder), unmedicated individuals with SPD (and no Axis I disorder), and early-onset (first 2 years of illness) SZ patients at baseline, 9-, and 18-month follow-up. Measures assessing frontal and temporal lobe integrity include multimodal MR imaging (structural MRI, DTI, resting-state fMRI, and task-based fMRI with a nonverbal event related working-memory task; baseline and 18-months) and neuropsychological assessment (all three timepoints). We will utilize dynamic causal modeling to test competing neurobiological models involving abnormal frontotemporal connectivity in the SZ-spectrum and machine learning approaches to integrate multimodal neuroimaging, neurocognitive, and clinical assessment data. We focus on three specific aims: (1) Investigate the longitudinal course of frontal-temporal lobe/circuitry abnormalities in the SZ-spectrum using multimodal MR imaging; (2) Investigate the longitudinal course of neurocognition, clinical, and functional outcome in the SZ spectrum; (3) Determine which factor or combination of factors differentiate groups in the SZ-spectrum to identify those that are associated with risk for and protection from SZ using machine learning.

"Optimized Affective Computing Measures of Social Processes and Negative Valence in Youth Psychopathology ABSTRACT Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research, but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750 adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics, and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth. Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with negative emotion and social behavior are present across many behavioral health conditions, but are poorly measured with existing tools.

"Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Depression has an enormous impact: it is the leading cause of disability worldwide and affects more than 264 million people of all ages. Moreover, major depression at any age doubles the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, which affect over 50 million people worldwide — a number projected to triple by 2050. Interventions for depression in older adults have limited efficacy to date, and directly treating cognitive impairment and/or Alzheimer’s Disease is not feasible or effective. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors that favorably influence both depression and cognition before dementia onset is an urgent public health need. Sleep is one such risk factor. However, sleep is not a uni-dimensional construct represented by merely its duration or the presence/absence of a sleep disorder. Rather sleep is multidimensional: it is comprised of multiple domains (e.g., Regularity, Satisfaction, Sleepiness, Timing, Efficiency, Duration) and measured on multiple levels (e.g. self-report or behavioral [via actigraphy]). In our initial R01, we leveraged our biostatistical and sleep expertise to develop and hone methods for examining multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of mortality in a high- dimensional machine learning (ML) context that flexibly accounts for the complex interactions that exist among sleep and non-sleep risk factors. We now seek to build on the success of the initial funding period by using our novel methods to examine multidimensional sleep health as a predictor of changes in cognition and depressive symptoms. To enhance generalizability and power, we are developing a Pooled Sample of N~3,400 adults aged ≥65 without cognitive impairment from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study, Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS). With these methods and data, we will examine multidimensional sleep health for predicting changes in global cognition and incident dementia (Aim 1) and depressive symptoms (Aim 2) in a high-dimensional machine learning context. We will also examine depression as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts impaired cognition (Aim 3). Our Secondary Aims are to: (a) apply parallel methods in two additional cohorts (the Rotterdam Study and Multi- Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) to replicate and extend our findings to cohorts with different demographic profiles and clinical Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias diagnoses; (b) examine effects by sex and race; and (c) identify the sleep health characteristics driving overall effects. Identifying multidimensional sleep health profiles that reliably predict changes in global cognition, incident dementia, and changes in depressive symptoms in a realistic, high dimensional context will directly inform the design of novel targeted interventions and prospective studies focused on preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias. Moreover, we will amplify the impact of our work by demonstrating new methods for studying health and depositing harmonized data on the National Sleep Research Resource to facilitate future multi-cohort secondary analyses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are among the leading contributors to morbidity, disability, and mortality worldwide. This project will apply novel machine learning techniques to large multi-cohort samples to determine whether multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes (change in cognition, incident dementia; Aim 1) and change in depressive symptoms (Aim 2), and examine depressive symptoms as a pathway through which multidimensional sleep health predicts cognitive outcomes. Through our multi-cohort secondary data analysis approach, which offers enhanced generalizability and power and an efficient use of existing resources, our findings will directly inform the design of subsequent prospective studies aimed at developing integrated approaches to treating depression and cognitive decline in older adults, with implications for preventing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.",Sleep Health Profiles Predicting Impaired Cognition and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults: Extending Novel Statistical Methods in Multi-Cohort Applications,10209375,RF1AG056331,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drowsiness', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'European', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guide prevention', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sex Differences', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'ethnic diversity', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'osteoporosis with pathological fracture', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'sleep health', 'sleep-focused interventions', 'sociodemographic factors', 'success']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,RF1,2021,1968065,570146095
